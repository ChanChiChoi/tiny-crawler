0808.00001	Galactic Globular and Open Clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. I. Crowded Field Photometry and Cluster Fiducial Sequences in ugriz	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Deokkeun An, Jennifer A. Johnson, James L. Clem, Brian Yanny, Constance M. Rockosi, Heather L. Morrison, Paul Harding, James E. Gunn, Carlos Allende Prieto, Timothy C. Beers, Kyle M. Cudworth, Inese I. Ivans, Zeljko Ivezic, Young Sun Lee, Robert H. Lupton, Dmitry Bizyaev, Howard Brewington, Elena Malanushenko, Viktor Malanushenko, Dan Oravetz, Kaike Pan, Audrey Simmons, Stephanie Snedden, Shannon Watters, Donald G. York	Abstract:  We present photometry for globular and open cluster stars observed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In order to exploit over 100 million stellar objects with r < 22.5 mag observed by SDSS, we need to understand the characteristics of stars in the SDSS ugriz filters. While star clusters provide important calibration samples for stellar colors, the regions close to globular clusters, where the fraction of field stars is smallest, are too crowded for the standard SDSS photometric pipeline to process. To complement the SDSS imaging survey, we reduce the SDSS imaging data for crowded cluster fields using the DAOPHOT/ALLFRAME suite of programs and present photometry for 17 globular clusters and 3 open clusters in a SDSS value-added catalog. Our photometry and cluster fiducial sequences are on the native SDSS 2.5-meter ugriz photometric system, and the fiducial sequences can be directly applied to the SDSS photometry without relying upon any transformations. Model photometry for red giant branch and main-sequence stars obtained by Girardi et al. cannot be matched simultaneously to fiducial sequences; their colors differ by ~0.02-0.05 mag. Good agreement (< ~0.02 mag in colors) is found with Clem et al. empirical fiducial sequences in u'g'r'i'z' when using the transformation equations in Tucker et al. 
0808.00002	Particle Physics in the Sky and Astrophysics Underground: Connecting the Universe's Largest and Smallest Scales	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Molly E.C. Swanson	Abstract:  Particles have tremendous potential as astronomical messengers, and conversely, studying the universe as a whole also teaches us about particle physics. This thesis encompasses both of these research directions. Many models predict a diffuse flux of high energy neutrinos from active galactic nuclei and other astrophysical sources. The "Astrophysics Underground" portion of this thesis describes a search for this neutrino flux performed by looking for very high energy upward-going muons using the Super-K detector. In addition to using particles to do astronomy, we can also use the universe itself as a particle physics lab. The "Particle Physics in the Sky" portion of this thesis focuses on extracting cosmological information from galaxy surveys. To overcome technical challenges faced by the latest galaxy surveys, we produced a comprehensive upgrade to mangle, a software package that processes the angular masks defining the survey area on the sky. We added dramatically faster algorithms and new useful features that are necessary for managing complex masks of current and next-generation galaxy surveys. With this software in hand, we utilized SDSS data to investigate the relation between galaxies and dark matter by studying relative bias, i.e., the relation between different types of galaxies. Separating galaxies by their luminosities and colors reveals a complicated picture: red galaxies are clustered more strongly than blue galaxies, with both the brightest and the faintest red galaxies showing the strongest clustering. Furthermore, red and blue galaxies tend to occupy different regions of space. In order to make precise measurements from the next generation of galaxy surveys, it will be essential to account for this complexity. 
0808.00003	Testing cosmological structure formation using redshift-space distortions	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Will J Percival, Martin White	Abstract:  Observations of redshift-space distortions in spectroscopic galaxy surveys offer an attractive method for observing the build-up of cosmological structure. In this paper we develop and test a new statistic based on anisotropies in the measured galaxy power spectrum, which is independent of galaxy bias and matches the matter power spectrum shape on large scales. The amplitude provides a constraint on the derivative of the linear growth rate through f.sigma_8. This demonstrates that spectroscopic galaxy surveys offer many of the same advantages as weak lensing surveys, in that they both use galaxies as test particles to probe all matter in the Universe. They are complementary as redshift-space distortions probe non-relativistic velocities and therefore the temporal metric perturbations, while weak lensing tests the sum of the temporal and spatial metric perturbations. The degree to which our estimator can be pushed into the non-linear regime is considered and we show that a simple Gaussian damping model, similar to that previously used to model the behaviour of the power spectrum on very small scales, can also model the quasi-linear behaviour of our estimator. This enhances the information that can be extracted from surveys for LCDM models. 
0808.00004	Inferring statistics of planet populations by means of automated microlensing searches	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Dominik, U. G. Jorgensen, K. Horne, Y. Tsapras, R. A. Street, L. Wyrzykowski, F. V. Hessman, M. Hundertmark, S. Rahvar, J. Wambsganss, G. Scarpetta, V. Bozza, S. Calchi Novati, L. Mancini, G. Masi, J. Teuber, T. C. Hinse, I. A. Steele, M. J. Burgdorf, S. Kane	Abstract:  (abridged) The study of other worlds is key to understanding our own, and not only provides clues to the origin of our civilization, but also looks into its future. Rather than in identifying nearby systems and learning about their individual properties, the main value of the technique of gravitational microlensing is in obtaining the statistics of planetary populations within the Milky Way and beyond. Only the complementarity of different techniques currently employed promises to yield a complete picture of planet formation that has sufficient predictive power to let us understand how habitable worlds like ours evolve, and how abundant such systems are in the Universe. A cooperative three-step strategy of survey, follow-up, and anomaly monitoring of microlensing targets, realized by means of an automated expert system and a network of ground-based telescopes is ready right now to be used to obtain a first census of cool planets with masses reaching even below that of Earth orbiting K and M dwarfs in two distinct stellar populations, namely the Galactic bulge and disk. The hunt for extra-solar planets acts as a principal science driver for time-domain astronomy with robotic-telescope networks adopting fully-automated strategies. Several initiatives, both into facilities as well as into advanced software and strategies, are supposed to see the capabilities of gravitational microlensing programmes step-wise increasing over the next 10 years. New opportunities will show up with high-precision astrometry becoming available and studying the abundance of planets around stars in neighbouring galaxies becoming possible. Finally, we should not miss out on sharing the vision with the general public, and make its realization to profit not only the scientists but all the wider society. 
0808.00005	Towards A Census of Earth-mass Exo-planets with Gravitational Microlensing	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J.P. Beaulieu, E. Kerins, S. Mao, D. Bennett, A. Cassan, S. Dieters, B.S. Gaudi, A. Gould, V. Batista, R. Bender, S. Brillant, K. Cook, C. Coutures, D. Dominis-Prester, J. Donatowicz, P. Fouqué, E. Grebel, J. Greenhill, D. Heyrovsky, K. Horne, D. Kubas, J.B. Marquette, J. Menzies, N.J. Rattenbury, I. Ribas, K. Sahu, Y. Tsapras, A. Udalski, C. Vinter	Abstract:  Thirteen exo-planets have been discovered using the gravitational microlensing technique (out of which 7 have been published). These planets already demonstrate that super-Earths (with mass up to ~10 Earth masses) beyond the snow line are common and multiple planet systems are not rare. In this White Paper we introduce the basic concepts of the gravitational microlensing technique, summarise the current mode of discovery and outline future steps towards a complete census of planets including Earth-mass planets. In the near-term (over the next 5 years) we advocate a strategy of automated follow-up with existing and upgraded telescopes which will significantly increase the current planet detection efficiency. In the medium 5-10 year term, we envision an international network of wide-field 2m class telescopes to discover Earth-mass and free-floating exo-planets. In the long (10-15 year) term, we strongly advocate a space microlensing telescope which, when combined with Kepler, will provide a complete census of planets down to Earth mass at almost all separations. Such a survey could be undertaken as a science programme on Euclid, a dark energy probe with a wide-field imager which has been proposed to ESA's Cosmic Vision Programme. 
0808.00006	Observation of the $φ(1680)$ and the Y(2175) in $e^+ e^- \to φπ^+π^-$	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The Belle Collaboration: C. P. Shen, et al    	Abstract:  The cross sections for $e^+ e^- \to φπ^+π^-$ and $e^+ e^- \to φ \fzero$ are measured from threshold to $\sqrt{s}=3.0$ $\hbox{GeV}$ using initial state radiation. The analysis is based on a data sample of 673 fb$^{-1}$ collected on and below the $Υ(4S)$ resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider. First measurements are reported for the resonance parameters of the $φ(1680)$ in the $φπ^+π^-$ mode: $m=(1689\pm 7\pm 10)$ MeV/$c^2$ and $Γ=(211\pm 14\pm 19)$ MeV/$c^2$. A structure at $\sqrt{s}=2.1 \hbox{GeV}/c^2$, corresponding to the so called Y(2175), is observed; its mass and width are determined to be $2079\pm13^{+79}_{-28}$ MeV/$c^2$ and $192\pm23^{+25}_{-61} \hbox{MeV}/c^2$, respectively. 
0808.00007	The Impact of ICM Substructure on Ram Pressure Stripping	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Stephanie Tonnesen, Greg L. Bryan (Columbia University)    	Abstract:  Cluster galaxies moving through the intracluster medium (ICM) are expected to lose some of their interstellar medium (ISM) through ram pressure stripping and related ISM-ICM interactions. Using high-resolution cosmological simulations of a large galaxy cluster including star formation, we show that the ram pressure a galaxy experiences at a fixed distance from the cluster center can vary by well over an order of magnitude We find that this variation in ram pressure is due in almost equal parts to variation in the ICM density and in the relative velocity between the galaxy and the ICM. We also find that the ICM and galaxy velocities are weakly correlated for in-falling galaxies. 
0808.00008	Wigner crystal vs. Friedel oscillations in the 1D Hubbard model	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Stefan A. Soeffing, Michael Bortz, Imke Schneider, Alexander Struck, Michael Fleischhauer, Sebastian Eggert	Abstract:  We analyze the fermion density of the one-dimensional Hubbard model using bosonization and numerical DMRG calculations. For finite systems we find a relatively sharp crossover even for moderate short range interactions into a region with $4k_F$ density waves as a function of density. The results show that the unstable fixed point of a spin-incoherent state can dominate the physical behavior in a large region of parameter space in finite systems. The crossover may be observable in ultra cold fermionic gases in optical lattices and in finite quantum wires. 
0808.00009	Non-Gaussianity from isocurvature perturbations	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Masahiro Kawasaki, Kazunori Nakayama, Toyokazu Sekiguchi, Teruaki Suyama, Fuminobu Takahashi	Abstract:  We develop a formalism to study non-Gaussianity in both curvature and isocurvature perturbations. It is shown that non-Gaussianity in the isocurvature perturbation between dark matter and photons leaves distinct signatures in the CMB temperature fluctuations, which may be confirmed in future experiments, or possibly, even in the currently available observational data. As an explicit example, we consider the QCD axion and show that it can actually induce sizable non-Gaussianity for the inflationary scale, H_{inf} = O(10^9 - 10^{11})GeV. 
0808.00010	Evolution of the UV Excess in Early-Type Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:David W. Atlee, Roberto J. Assef, Christopher S. Kochanek	Abstract:  We examine the UV emission from luminous early-type galaxies as a function of redshift. We perform a stacking analysis using Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) images of galaxies in the NOAO Deep Wide Field Survey (NDWFS) Boötes field and examine the evolution in the UV colors of the average galaxy. Our sample, selected to have minimal ongoing star formation based on the optical to mid-IR SEDs of the galaxies, includes 1843 galaxies spanning the redshift range $0.05\leq z\leq0.65$. We find evidence that the strength of the UV excess decreases, on average, with redshift, and our measurements also show moderate disagreement with previous models of the UV excess. Our results show little evolution in the shape of the UV continuum with redshift, consistent either with the binary model for the formation of Extreme Horizontal Branch (EHB) stars or with no evolution in EHB morphology with look-back time. However, the binary formation model predicts that the strength of the UV excess should also be relatively constant, in contradiction with our measured results. Finally, we see no significant influence of a galaxy's environment on the strength of its UV excess. 
0808.00011	Evidence for B semileptonic decays into the charmed baryon Lambda_c+	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We present the first evidence for B semileptonic decays into the charmed baryon Lambda_c+ based on 420 fb-1 of data collected at the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II e+e- storage rings. Events are tagged by fully reconstructing one of the B mesons in a hadronic decay mode. We measure the relative branching fraction BF(Bbar -> Lambda_c+ X l- nubar_l)/BF(Bbar -> Lambda_c+/Lambda_c- X) = (3.2 +/- 0.9_stat +/- 0.9_syst)%. The significance of the signal including the systematic uncertainty is 4.9 standard deviations. 
0808.00012	Lectures on Probability, Entropy, and Statistical Physics	Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)	Authors:Ariel Caticha	Abstract:  These lectures deal with the problem of inductive inference, that is, the problem of reasoning under conditions of incomplete information. Is there a general method for handling uncertainty? Or, at least, are there rules that could in principle be followed by an ideally rational mind when discussing scientific matters? What makes one statement more plausible than another? How much more plausible? And then, when new information is acquired how do we change our minds? Or, to put it differently, are there rules for learning? Are there rules for processing information that are objective and consistent? Are they unique? And, come to think of it, what, after all, is information? It is clear that data contains or conveys information, but what does this precisely mean? Can information be conveyed in other ways? Is information physical? Can we measure amounts of information? Do we need to? Our goal is to develop the main tools for inductive inference--probability and entropy--from a thoroughly Bayesian point of view and to illustrate their use in physics with examples borrowed from the foundations of classical statistical physics. 
0808.00013	Sigma Invariants of Direct Products of Groups	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Robert Bieri, Ross Geoghegan	Abstract:  The Product Conjecture for the homological Bieri-Neumann-Strebel-Renz invariants is proved over a field. Under certain hypotheses the Product Conjecture is shown to also hold over Z, even though D. Schuetz has recently shown that the Conjecture is false in general over Z. Our version over Z is applied in a joint paper with D. Kochloukova to derive new information about subgroups of Thompson's group F, namely that F has subgroups F_m which are not of type F_{m+1}. 
0808.00014	Local chiral fermions	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Michael Creutz	Abstract:  Borici's construction of minimally doubled chiral fermions builds on a linear combination of two unitarily related naive fermion actions. Being strictly local, extremely efficient numerical implementation should be possible. The resulting system is symmetric under the subgroup of the hypercubic group that preserves a major hypercube diagonal. The symmetry includes both parity even and odd transformations, but allows for an anisotropy to appear at finite lattice spacing. 
0808.00015	Directed flow in non-adiabatic stochastic pumps	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Saar Rahav, Jordan Horowitz, Christopher Jarzynski	Abstract:  We analyze the operation of a molecular machine driven by the non-adiabatic variation of external parameters. We derive a formula for the integrated flow from one configuration to another, obtain a "no-pumping theorem" for cyclic processes with thermally activated transitions, and show that in the adiabatic limit the pumped current is given by a geometric expression. 
0808.00016	Disc instabilities and semi-analytic modelling of galaxy formation	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:E. Athanassoula	Abstract:  The Efstathiou, Lake and Negroponte (1982) criterion can not distinguish bar stable from bar unstable discs and thus should not be used in semi-analytic galaxy formation simulations. I discuss the reasons for this, illustrate it with examples and point out shortcomings in the recipes used for spheroid formation. I propose an alternative, although much less straightforward, possibility. 
0808.00017	Search for Invisible Decays of a Light Scalar in Radiative Transitions Upsilon(3S) -> gamma A0	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BaBar Collaboration, B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We search for a light scalar particle produced in single-photon decays of the Upsilon(3S) resonance through the process Upsilon(3S) -> gamma A0, A0 -> invisible. Such an object appears in Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model, where a light CP-odd Higgs boson naturally couples strongly to b-quarks. If, in addition, there exists a light, stable neutralino, decays of A0 could be preferentially to an invisible final state. We search for events with a single high-energy photon and a large missing mass, consistent with a 2-body decay of Upsilon(3S). We find no evidence for such processes in a sample of 122*10^6 Upsilon(3S) decays collected by the BABAR collaboration at the PEP-II B-factory, and set 90% C.L. upper limits on the branching fraction B(Upsilon(3S) -> gamma A0)*B(A0 -> invisible) at (0.7-31)*10^{-6} in the mass range m(A0)<=7.8 GeV. The results are preliminary. 
0808.00018	Ca II Triplet Spectroscopy of Small Magellanic Cloud Red Giants. I. Abundances and Velocities for a Sample of Clusters	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. C. Parisi, A. J. Grocholski, D. Geisler, A. Sarajedini, J. J. Claria	Abstract:  We have obtained near-infrared spectra covering the Ca II triplet lines for a number of stars associated with 16 SMC clusters using the VLT + FORS2. These data compose the largest available sample of SMC clusters with spectroscopically derived abundances and velocities. Our clusters span a wide range of ages and provide good areal coverage of the galaxy. Cluster members are selected using a combination of their positions relative to the cluster center as well as their abundances and radial velocities. We determine mean cluster velocities to typically 2.7 km/s and metallicities to 0.05 dex (random errors), from an average of 6.4 members per cluster. (continued in paper)

The aim of this text is to be understandable by a first year master student. 
0808.00020	Finite Size Corrections to Entanglement in Quantum Critical Systems	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:F. C. Alcaraz, M. S. Sarandy	Abstract:  We analyze the finite size corrections to entanglement in quantum critical systems. By using conformal symmetry and density functional theory, we discuss the structure of the finite size contributions to a general measure of ground state entanglement, which are ruled by the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory. More generally, we show that all conformal towers formed by an infinite number of excited states (as the size of the system $L \to \infty$) exhibit a unique pattern of entanglement, which differ only at leading order $(1/L)^2$. In this case, entanglement is also shown to obey a universal structure, given by the anomalous dimensions of the primary operators of the theory. As an illustration, we discuss the behavior of pairwise entanglement for the eigenspectrum of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with an arbitrary length $L$ for both periodic and twisted boundary conditions. 
0808.00021	Short-range Charge and Spin Superstructures in Doped Layered Co Perovskites	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:N. Sakiyama, I. A. Zaliznyak, S. -H. Lee, Y. Mitsui, H. Yoshizawa	Abstract:  We have investigated cobaltite relatives of the layered perovskite cuprates and nickelates, Pr$_{2-x}$Ca$_x$CoO$_4$ ($0.39 \leq x \leq 0.73$) and La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CoO$_4$ ($x = 0.61$), using elastic neutron scattering. We have discovered doping-dependent incommensurate short-range ordering of charges and magnetic moments, which in cobaltites occur in the range of heavy doping, $ 0.5 \lesssim x \lesssim 0.75$. The charge order exists already at room temperature and shows no change on cooling. The incommensurability of its propagation vector, ${\bf Q}_c = (ε_c,0,l)$, roughly scales with the concentration of Co$^{2+}$ ions, $ε_c \sim (1-x)$. Magnetic order is only established at low T$\lesssim 40$ K and has twice larger periodicity, indicating a dominant antiferromagnetic correlation between the nearest Co$^{2+}$ spins. 
0808.00022	Parton transport and hadronization from the dynamical quasiparticle point of view	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:W. Cassing (U. Giessen), E.L. Bratkovskaya (FIAS, U. Frankfurt)    	Abstract:  The hadronization of an expanding partonic fireball is studied within the Parton-Hadron-Strings Dynamics (PHSD) approach which is based on a dynamical quasiparticle model (DQPM) matched to reproduce lattice QCD results in thermodynamic equilibrium. Apart from strong parton interactions the expansion and development of collective flow is driven by strong gradients in the parton mean-fields. An analysis of the elliptic flow $v_2$ demonstrates a linear correlation with the spatial eccentricity $ε$ as in case of ideal hydrodynamics. The hadronization occurs by quark-antiquark fusion or 3 quark/3 antiquark recombination which is described by covariant transition rates. Since the dynamical quarks become very massive, the formed resonant 'pre-hadronic' color-dipole states ($q\bar{q}$ or $qqq$) are of high invariant mass, too, and sequentially decay to the groundstate meson and baryon octets increasing the total entropy. This solves the entropy problem in hadronization in a natural way. The resulting particle ratios turn out to be in line with those from a grandcanonical partition function at temperature $T \approx 170$ MeV rather independent from the initial temperature and indicate an approximate strangeness equilibration. 
0808.00023	Branching proofs of infeasibility in low density subset sum problems	Computational Complexity (cs.CC)	Authors:Gabor Pataki, Mustafa Tural	Abstract:  We prove that the subset sum problem has a polynomial time computable certificate of infeasibility for all $a$ weight vectors with density at most $1/(2n)$ and for almost all integer right hand sides. The certificate is branching on a hyperplane, i.e. by a methodology dual to the one explored by Lagarias and Odlyzko; Frieze; Furst and Kannan; and Coster et. al. The proof has two ingredients. We first prove that a vector that is near parallel to $a$ is a suitable branching direction, regardless of the density. Then we show that for a low density $a$ such a near parallel vector can be computed using diophantine approximation, via a methodology introduced by Frank and Tardos. We also show that there is a small number of long intervals whose disjoint union covers the integer right hand sides, for which the infeasibility is proven by branching on the above hyperplane. 
0808.00024	Homotopy classification of maps into homogeneous spaces	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Sergiy Koshkin	Abstract:  We give an alternative to Postnikov's homotopy classification of maps from 3-dimensional CW-complexes to homogeneous spaces G/H of Lie groups. It describes homotopy classes in terms of lifts to the group G and is suitable for extending the notion of homotopy to Sobolev maps. This is required for applications to variational problems of mathematical physics.

Ryan	Abstract:  We study the insertion and value of metric observables in the (discrete) path integral formulation of the Ponzano-Regge spinfoam model for 3d quantum gravity. In particular, we discuss the length spectrum and the relation between insertion of such B-observables and gauge fixing in the path integral. 
0808.00026	Determination of the Superfluid Gap in Atomic Fermi Gases by Quasiparticle Spectroscopy	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Andre Schirotzek, Yong-il Shin, Christian H. Schunck, Wolfgang Ketterle	Abstract:  We present majority and minority radiofrequency (RF) spectra of strongly interacting imbalanced Fermi gases of Li-6. We observed a smooth evolution in the nature of pairing correlations from pairing in the superfluid region to polaron binding in the highly polarized normal region. The imbalance induces quasiparticles in the superfluid region even at very low temperature. This leads to a local bimodal spectral response, which allows us to determine the superfluid gap Δand the Hartree energy U.

Orlov	Abstract:  The symlectic quantum tomography for the general linear quantization is introduced. Using the approach based upon the Wigner function techniques the evolution equation of quantum tomograms is derived for a parametric driven oscillator.

Lorenzo Diaz-Cruz (FCFM-BUAP, Puebla)    	Abstract:  It is proposed that the Higgs vacuum possesses a small-scale structure that can explain the large discrepancy between the predicted electroweak vacuum energy density and the observed cosmological constant. An effective Lagrangian description is employed to obtain modifications to the Standard Model predictions that can be tested at collider experiments. 
0808.00029	Link invariants from finite racks	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Sam Nelson	Abstract:  We define ambient isotopy invariants of oriented knots and links using the counting invariants of framed links defined by finite racks. These invariants reduce to the usual quandle counting invariant when the rack in question is a quandle. We are able to further enhance these counting invariants with 2-cocycles from the coloring rack's second rack cohomology satisfying a new degeneracy condition which reduces to the usual case for quandles. 
0808.00030	Effect of CuO chains on the local density of states in the vortex phase of YBa_2Cu_3O_7	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:W. A. Atkinson	Abstract:  We examine the effects of the CuO chains on the density of states in the vortex phase in YBa_2Cu_3O_7, via a calculation based on the tight-binding proximity model. In this model, chain superconductivity results from single-electron hopping between the intrinsically-normal chains and intrinsically-superconducting CuO_2 planes. The calculations are based on self-consistent solutions of the Bogolyubov-de Gennes equations for a bilayer consisting of a single CuO_2 layer and a single CuO chain layer. We find that, in addition to the dispersing resonances found in single-layer models, the chains introduce a second set of dispersing resonances associated with the induced gap in the chain layer. These new resonances are highly anisotropic and distort the vortex core shape. 
0808.00031	Top Quark Physics at the LHC	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Akira Shibata	Abstract:  An overview of the prospects of top quark physics at the LHC is presented. The ATLAS and the CMS detectors are about to produce a large amount of data with high top quark contents from the LHC proton-proton collisions. A wide variet y of physics analyses is planned in both experiments, and a number of useful insights have already been obtained regarding their detector performance and physics potential. This summary is based on the talk presented at the Hadron C ollider Physics Symposium 2008, Galena, Illinois, May 27-31, 2008. 
0808.00032	Relating the microscopic rules in coalescence-fragmentation models to the macroscopic cluster size distributions which emerge	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Blazej Ruszczycki, Ben Burnett, Zhenyuan Zhao, Neil F. Johnson	Abstract:  Coalescence-fragmentation problems are of great interest across the physical, biological, and recently social sciences. They are typically studied from the perspective of the rate equations, at the heart of such models are the rules used for coalescence and fragmentation. Here we discuss how changes in these microscopic rules affect the macroscopic cluster-size distribution which emerges from the solution to the rate equation. More generally, our work elucidates the crucial role that the fragmentation rule can play in such dynamical grouping models. We focus on two well-known models whose fragmentation rules lie at opposite extremes setting the models within the broader context of binary coalescence-fragmentation models. Further, we provide a range of generalizations and new analytic results for a well-known model of social group formation [V. M. Eguiluz and M. G. Zimmermann, Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 5659 (2000)]. We develop analytic perturbation treatment of the original model, and extend the mathematical to the treatment of growing and declining populations. 
0808.00033	Surface order-disorder phase transitions and percolation	Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)	Authors:M. Cecilia Gimenez, Felix Nieto, Antonio J. Ramirez-Pastor	Abstract:  In the present paper, the connection between surface order-disorder phase transitions and the percolating properties of the adsorbed phase has been studied. For this purpose, four lattice-gas models in presence of repulsive interactions have been considered. Namely, monomers on honeycomb, square and triangular lattices, and dimers (particles occupying two adjacent adsorption sites) on square substrates. By using Monte Carlo simulation and finite-size scaling analysis, we obtain the percolation threshold $θ_c$ of the adlayer, which presents an interesting dependence with $w/k_BT$ (being $w$, $k_B$ and $T$, the lateral interaction energy, the Boltzmann's constant and temperature, respectively). For each geometry and adsorbate size, a phase diagram separating a percolating and a non-percolating region is determined. 
0808.00034	Sums of squares and moment problems in equivariant situations	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Jaka Cimpric, Salma Kuhlmann, Claus Scheiderer	Abstract:  We begin a systematic study of positivity and moment problems in an equivariant setting. Given a reductive group $G$ over $\R$ acting on an affine $\R$-variety $V$, we consider the induced dual action on the coordinate ring $\R[V]$ and on the linear dual space of $\R[V]$. In this setting, given an invariant closed semialgebraic subset $K$ of $V(\R)$, we study the problem of representation of invariant nonnegative polynomials on $K$ by invariant sums of squares, and the closely related problem of representation of invariant linear functionals on $\R[V]$ by invariant measures supported on $K$. To this end, we analyse the relation between quadratic modules of $\R[V]$ and associated quadratic modules of the (finitely generated) subring $\R[V]^G$ of invariant polynomials. We apply our results to investigate the finite solvability of an equivariant version of the multidimensional $K$-moment problem. Most of our results are specific to the case where the group $G(\R)$ is compact. 
0808.00035	An anticipating Itô formula for Lévy processes	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Elisa Alòs, Jorge A. León, Josep Vives	Abstract:  In this paper, we use the Malliavin calculus techniques to obtain an anticipative version of the change of variable formula for Lévy processes. Here the coefficients are in the domain of the anihilation (gradient) operator in the "future sense", which includes the family of all adapted and square-integrable processes. This domain was introduced on the Wiener space by Alòs and Nualart. 
0808.00036	Why Does a Kronecker Model Result in Misleading Capacity Estimates?	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Vasanthan Raghavan, Jayesh H. Kotecha, Akbar M. Sayeed	Abstract:  Many recent works that study the performance of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems in practice assume a Kronecker model where the variances of the channel entries, upon decomposition on to the transmit and the receive eigen-bases, admit a separable form. Measurement campaigns, however, show that the Kronecker model results in poor estimates for capacity. Motivated by these observations, a channel model that does not impose a separable structure has been recently proposed and shown to fit the capacity of measured channels better. In this work, we show that this recently proposed modeling framework can be viewed as a natural consequence of channel decomposition on to its canonical coordinates, the transmit and/or the receive eigen-bases. Using tools from random matrix theory, we then establish the theoretical basis behind the Kronecker mismatch at the low- and the high-SNR extremes: 1) Sparsity of the dominant statistical degrees of freedom (DoF) in the true channel at the low-SNR extreme, and 2) Non-regularity of the sparsity structure (disparities in the distribution of the DoF across the rows and the columns) at the high-SNR extreme. 
0808.00037	An Energy-Based Comparison of Long-Hop and Short-Hop Routing in MIMO Networks	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Caleb K. Lo, Sriram Vishwanath, Robert W. Heath Jr	Abstract:  This paper considers the problem of selecting either routes that consist of long hops or routes that consist of short hops in a network of multiple-antenna nodes, where each transmitting node employs spatial multiplexing. This distance-dependent route selection problem is approached from the viewpoint of energy efficiency, where a route is selected with the objective of minimizing the transmission energy consumed while satisfying a target outage criterion at the final destination. Deterministic line networks and two-dimensional random networks are considered. It is shown that when 1) the number of hops traversed between the source and destination grows large or 2) when the target success probability approaches one or 3) when the number of transmit and/or receive antennas grows large, short-hop routing requires less energy than long-hop routing. It is also shown that if both routing strategies are subject to the same delay constraint, long-hop routing requires less energy than short-hop routing as the target success probability approaches one. In addition, numerical analysis indicates that given loose outage constraints, only a small number of transmit antennas are needed for short-hop routing to have its maximum advantage over long-hop routing, while given stringent outage constraints, the advantage of short-hop over long-hop routing always increases with additional transmit antennas. 
0808.00038	Superdisks and the structural asymmetry of radio galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Gopal-Krishna, Paul J. Wiita	Abstract:  We present a sample of 16 radio galaxies, each of which is characterized by a wide, elongated emission gap with fairly sharp and straight edges between the two radio lobes. This particular subset of the 'superdisk' radio galaxies is chosen because of a highly asymmetric location of the host elliptical galaxy relative to the gap's central axis. In addition to posing a considerable challenge to the existing models, such a morphology also means that the two jets traverse highly unequal distances through the superdisk material. One thus has a possibility to directly investigate if the marked asymmetry between the two jets' interaction with the (much denser) ambient medium, during their propagation, has a significant import for the brightness of the hotspot forming near each jet's extremity. We also propose a new explanation for the formation of superdisks through the merger of a smaller elliptical galaxy with the massive host, in which the gas attached to the infalling galaxy deposits its angular momentum into the host's circumgalactic gas, thereby causing it to flatten into a fat pancake, or superdisk. The asymmetric location of the host galaxy can be assisted by the kick imparted to it during the merger. We also suggest a physical link between these radio galaxies and those with X-shaped and Z-symmetric radio lobes, commonly believed to arise from mergers of two galactic nuclei, each harboring a supermassive black hole. 
0808.00039	The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Limit of the Boltzmann Equation for Hard Cutoff Potentials	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:François Golse, Laure Saint-Raymond	Abstract:  The present paper proves that all limit points of sequences of renormalized solutions of the Boltzmann equation in the limit of small, asymptotically equivalent Mach and Knudsen numbers are governed by Leray solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. This convergence result holds for hard cutoff potentials in the sense of H. Grad, and therefore completes earlier results by the same authors [Invent. Math. 155, 81-161(2004)] for Maxwell molecules. 
0808.00040	Evidence for Unconventional Superconductivity in Arsenic-Free Iron-Based Superconductor FeSe : A ^77Se-NMR Study	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:H. Kotegawa, S. Masaki, Y. Awai, H. Tou, Y. Mizuguchi, Y. Takano	Abstract:  We report the results of $^{77}$Se--nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in $α$-FeSe, which exhibits a similar crystal structure to the LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ superconductor and shows superconductivity at 8 K. The nuclear-spin lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ shows $T^3$ behavior below the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ without a coherence peak. The $T_1T=$ const. behavior, indicative of the Fermi liquid state, can be seen in a wide temperature range above $T_c$. The superconductivity in $α$-FeSe is also an unconventional one as well as LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ and related materials. The FeAs layer is not essential for the occurrence of the unconventional superconductivity. 
0808.00041	Molecular Dynamics Simulation on a Glassforming NiZr- System: Diffusion Coefficients and Critical Temperature	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:A.B. Mutiara	Abstract:  The diffusion coefficients of Ni DNi and Zr DZr, and also the critical temperature Tc of the system, as results of data analysis from Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation, are presented. An NpT-Ensemble of 648 atoms is simulated in a Box with L ~ 26,2 Angstrom by using Stillinger-Weber potential model with adopting paramaters for NiZr-System that based on results of first-principle electron teori from Hausleitner and Hafner. The present simulations are carried out by numerically integrating the Newtonian equation of atoms, and for integrating a fifth order predictor- corrector algorithm is used with time step dt = 2.5 10-15 s. Then diffusion coefficients and a critical temperature Tc are analyzed qualitatively on the basis of mode- coupling theory (MCT) for glass transition (GT). One of MCT-predictions is that temperature dependence of Diffusion coefficients follows a power-law with non- universal exponent parameter gamma, namely Di ~|T-Tc|^gamma From analysis results it is found that Tc ~ 950 K with gamma ~ 1.8 for Ni-atom and gamma ~ 2.0 for Zr-atom. 
0808.00042	Efficient quantum key distribution over a collective noise channel	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Xi-Han Li, Fu-Guo Deng, Hong-Yu Zhou	Abstract:  We present two efficient quantum key distribution schemes over two different collective-noise channels. The accepted hypothesis of collective noise is that photons travel inside a time window small compared to the variation of noise. Noiseless subspaces are made up of two Bell states and the spatial degree of freedom is introduced to form two nonorthogonal bases. Although these protocols resort to entangled states for encoding the key bit, the receiver is only required to perform single-particle product measurements and there is no basis mismatch. Moreover, the detection is passive as the receiver does not switch his measurements between two conjugate measurement bases to get the key. 
0808.00043	The Invention of Proteomic Code and mRNA Assisted Protein Folding	Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)	Authors:Jan C Biro	Abstract:  Background The theoretical requirements for a genetic code were well defined and modeled by George Gamow and Francis Crick in the 50-es. Their models failed. However the valid Genetic Code, provided by Nirenberg and Matthaei in 1961, ignores many theoretical requirements for a perfect Code. Something is simply missing from the canonical Code. Results The 3x redundancy of the Genetic code is usually explained as a necessity to increase the resistance of the mutation resistance of the genetic information. However it has many additional roles. 1.) It has a periodical structure which corresponds to the physico-chemical and structural properties of amino acids. 2.) It provides physico-chemical definition of codon boundaries. 3.) It defines a code for amino acid co-locations (interactions) in the coded proteins. 4.) It regulates, through wobble bases the free folding energy (and structure) of mRNAs. I shortly review the history of the Genetic Code as well as my own published observations to provide a novel, original explanation of its redundancy. Conclusions The redundant Genetic Code contains biological information which is additional to the 64/20 definition of amino acids. This additional information is used to define the 3D structure of coding nucleic acids as well as the coded proteins and it is called the Proteomic Code and mRNA Assisted Protein Folding. 
0808.00044	Optimal dataset combining in f_nl constraints from large scale structure in an idealised case	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Anze Slosar	Abstract:  We consider the problem of optimal weighting of tracers of structure for the purpose of constraining the non-Gaussianity parameter f_NL. We work within the Fisher matrix formalism expanded around fiducial model with f_NL=0 and make several simplifying assumptions. By slicing a general sample into infinitely many samples with different biases, we derive the analytic expression for the relevant Fisher matrix element. We next consider weighting schemes that construct two effective samples from a single sample of tracers with a continuously varying bias. We show that a particularly simple ansatz for weighting functions can recover all information about f_NL in the initial sample that is recoverable using a given bias observable and that simple division into two equal samples is considerably suboptimal when sampling of modes is good, but only marginally suboptimal in the limit where Poisson errors dominate. 
0808.00045	Logarithmic corrections to entropy for black holes with hyperbolic horizon	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Yun Soo Myung	Abstract:  We compute logarithmic corrections to entropy for black holes with hyperbolic horizon. For this purpose, we introduce the topological black hole and MTZ black holes in four dimensions, while in five dimensions, the topological black holes and Gauss-Bonnet black hole with negative coupling are considered. As they stand, logarithmic corrections are problematic because small black holes with positive heat capacity have negative energies. However, introducing the background state of extremal black hole, the logarithmic corrections are performed for black hole with hyperbolic horizon. 
0808.00046	Representations of Lie Superalgebras in Prime Characteristic I	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Weiqiang Wang, Lei Zhao	Abstract:  We initiate the representation theory of restricted Lie superalgebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p>2. A superalgebra generalization of the celebrated Kac-Weisfeiler Conjecture is formulated, which exhibits a mixture of p-power and 2-power divisibilities of dimensions of modules. We establish the Conjecture for basic classical Lie superalgebras. 
0808.00047	Finite temperature Casimir effect in piston geometry and its classical limit	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:S.C. Lim, L.P. Teo	Abstract:  We consider the Casimir force acting on a $d$-dimensional rectangular piston due to massless scalar field with periodic, Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions and electromagnetic field with perfect electric conductor and perfect magnetic conductor boundary conditions. It is verified analytically that at any temperature, the Casimir force acting on the piston is always an attractive force pulling the piston towards the interior region, and the magnitude of the force gets larger as the separation $a$ gets smaller. Explicit exact expressions for the Casimir force for small and large plate separations and for low and high temperatures are computed. The limits of the Casimir force acting on the piston when some pairs of transversal plates are large are also derived. An interesting result regarding the influence of temperature is that in contrast to the conventional result that the leading term of the Casimir force acting on a wall of a rectangular cavity at high temperature is the Stefan--Boltzmann (or black body radiation) term which is of order $T^{d+1}$, it is found that the contributions of this term from the interior and exterior regions cancel with each other in the case of piston. The high temperature leading order term of the Casimir force acting on the piston is of order $T$, which shows that the Casimir force has a nontrivial classical $\hbar\to 0$ limit. 
0808.00048	Measurements of B Hadron Properties at the Tevatron	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Mark Hartz	Abstract:  Recent measurements of B hadron properties carried out in sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV p/p-bar collisions at the Tevatron are reviewed. Included are measurements of the Bc+ meson lifetime, using J/psi+l+X final states, and the mass, using J/psi+pi final states, a flavor specific measurement of the Bs0 lifetime in Ds+pi+X decays, simultaneous measurements of the Bs0 lifetime and lifetime difference in J/psi+phi decays, the first direct evidence and mass measurements of the Xi_b- baryon, and measurements of the polarization of 1S charmonium. For all measurements, charge conjugate modes are included. 
0808.00049	A note on the invariant subspace problem relative to a type ${\rm II}_1$ factor	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Junsheng Fang, Don Hadwin	Abstract:  Let $\M$ be a type ${\rm II}_1$ factor with a faithful normal tracial state $τ$ and let $\M^ω$ be the ultrapower algebra of $\M$. In this paper, we prove that for every operator $T\in \M^ω$, there is a family of projections $\{P_t\}_{0\leq t\leq 1}$ in $\M^ω$ such that $TP_t=P_tTP_t$, $P_s\leq P_t$ if $s\leq t$, and $τ_ω(P_t)=t$. Let $\mathfrak{M}=\{Z \in \M: \text{there is a family of projections} \{P_t\}_{0\leq t\leq 1} \text{in} \M \text{such that} ZP_t=P_tZP_t, P_s\leq P_t \text{if} s\leq t, \text{and} τ(P_t)=t\}$. As an application we show that for every operator $T\in \M$ and $ε>0$, there is an operator $S\in \mathfrak{M}$ such that $\|S\|\leq \|T\|$ and $\|S-T\|_2<ε$. We also show that $\prod_n^ωM_n(\cc)$ is not $\ast$-isomorphic to the ultrapower algebra of the hyperfinite type ${\rm II}_1$ factor. 
0808.00050	Measurement of the Top Quark Mass using Quantities with Minimal Dependence on the Jet Energy Scale	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:F. Garberson (1), C. Hill (2), J. Incandela (1), S. Koay (1), R. Rossin (1) ((1) University of California Santa Barbara, (2) University of Bristol)    	Abstract:  We present three measurements of the top quark mass in the lepton plus jets channel with 1.9 fb-1 of data using quantities with minimal dependence on the jet energy scale in the lepton plus jets channel at CDF. One measurement uses the mean transverse decay length of b-tagged jets (L2d) to determine the top mass, another uses the transverse momentum of the lepton (LepPt) to determine the top mass, and a third measurement uses both variables simultaneously. Using the L2d variable we measure a top mass of 176.7 (+10.0) (-8.9) (stat) +/- 3.4 (syst) GeV/c^2, using the LepPt variable we measure a top mass of 173.5 (+8.9) (-9.1) (stat) +/- 4.2 (syst) GeV/c^2, and doing the combined measurement using both variables we arrive at a top mass result of 175.3 +/- 6.2 (stat) +/- 3.0 (syst) GeV/c^2. Since some of the systematic uncertainties are statistically limited, these results are expected to improve significantly if more data is added at the Tevatron in the future, or if the measurement is done at the LHC. 
0808.00051	Birth and death in discrete Morse theory	Algebraic Topology (math.AT)	Authors:Henry King, Kevin Knudson, Neza Mramor	Abstract:  Suppose $M$ is a finite simplicial complex and that for $0=t_0,t_1,...,t_r=1$ we have a discrete Morse function $F_{t_i}:M\to \zr$. In this paper, we study the births and deaths of critical cells for the functions $F_{t_i}$ and present an algorithm for pairing the cells that occur in adjacent slices. We first study the case where the triangulation of $M$ is the same for each $t_i$, and then generalize to the case where the triangulations may differ. This has potential applications in data imaging, where one has function values at a sample of points in some region in space at several different times or at different levels in an object. 
0808.00052	Hardy's Test versus the CHSH Test of Quantum Non-Locality: Fundamental and Practical Aspects	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Daniel Braun, Mahn-Soo Choi	Abstract:  We compare two different tests of quantum non-locality, both in theoretical terms and with respect to a possible implementation in a mesoscopic circuit: Hardy's test [Hardy, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{68}, 2981 (1992)] and the CHSH test, the latter including a recently discovered inequality relevant for experiments with three possible outcomes [Collins and Gisin, J. Phys. A \textbf{37}, 1775 (2004)]. We clarify the geometry of the correlations defined by Hardy's equations with respect to the polytope of causal correlations, and show that these equations generalize to the CHSH inequality if the slightest imperfections in the setup need to be taken into account. We propose a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two interacting Mach-Zehnder interferometers in a Hall bar system for which both Hardy's test and the CHSH test can be realized with a simple change of gate voltages, and evaluate the robustness of the two tests in the case of fluctuating experimental parameters. The proposed setup is remarkably robust and should work for fluctuations of beam splitter angles or phases up to the order of one radian, or single particle loss rates up to about 15%. 
0808.00053	Scaling properties of complex networks: Toward Wilsonian renormalization for complex networks	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:Kento Ichikawa, Masato Uchida, Masato Tsuru, Yuji Oie	Abstract:  Nowadays, scaling methods for general large-scale complex networks have been developed. We proposed a new scaling scheme called "two-site scaling". This scheme was applied iteratively to various networks, and we observed how the degree distribution of the network changes by two-site scaling. In particular, networks constructed by the BA algorithm behave differently from the networks observed in the nature. In addition, an iterative scaling scheme can define a new renormalizing method. We investigated the possibility of defining the Wilsonian renormalization group method on general complex networks and its application to the analysis of the dynamics of complex networks.

Christensen, Sebastian Will, Michele Saba, Gyu-Boong Jo, Yong-Il Shin, Wolfgang Ketterle, David Pritchard	Abstract:  Ultracold sodium atoms have been trapped inside a hollow-core optical fiber. The atoms are transferred from a free space optical dipole trap into a trap formed by a red-detuned gaussian light mode confined to the core of the fiber. We show that at least 5% of the atoms held initially in the free space trap can be loaded into the core of the fiber and retrieved outside. 
0808.00055	Integrating OPC Data into GSN Infrastructures	Software Engineering (cs.SE)	Authors:Olivier Passalacqua (LISTIC), Eric Benoit (LISTIC, LAMII), Marc-Philippe Huget (LISTIC), Patrice Moreaux (LISTIC)    	Abstract:  This paper presents the design and the implementation of an interface software component between OLE for Process Control (OPC) formatted data and the Global Sensor Network (GSN) framework for management of data from sensors. This interface, named wrapper in the GSN context, communicates in Data Access mode with an OPC server and converts the received data to the internal GSN format, according to several temporal modes. This work is realized in the context of a Ph.D. Thesis about the control of distributed information fusion systems. The developed component allows the injection of OPC data, like measurements or industrial processes states information, into a distributed information fusion system deployed in a GSN framework. The component behaves as a client of the OPC server. Developed in Java and based on the Opensaca Utgard, it can be deployed on any computation node supporting a Java virtual machine. The experiments show the component conformity according to the Data Access 2.05a specification of the OPC standard and to the temporal modes. 
0808.00056	I'm sorry to say, but your understanding of image processing fundamentals is absolutely wrong	Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)	Authors:Emanuel Diamant	Abstract:  The ongoing discussion whether modern vision systems have to be viewed as visually-enabled cognitive systems or cognitively-enabled vision systems is groundless, because perceptual and cognitive faculties of vision are separate components of human (and consequently, artificial) information processing system modeling. 
0808.00057	Asymmetric Magnetization Reversal in a Single Exchange-Biased Micro Bar	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:T. Gredig, M. Tondra	Abstract:  The asymmetric magnetization reversal is studied in a single exchange-biased microbar of 1.5 x 13 micrometer with anisotropic magnetoresistance and magnetic force microscopy. The particle has a moment of less than 10^-9 emu and is not accessible with standard magnetometry. The asymmetric hysteresis loop of CoFe/CrMnPt shows a repeatable rotation process, followed by an irreversible nucleation process that is marked by jumps in the magnetoresistance. The induced unidirectional anisotropy enhances the rotation process in one branch of the hysteresis loop, followed by a sped up nucleation process. Imprinted ferromagnetic domain patterns left behind by the antiferromagnet are observed after the nucleation process occurred but before complete saturation is reached. 
0808.00058	Classifying subcategories of modules over a commutative noetherian ring	Commutative Algebra (math.AC)	Authors:Ryo Takahashi	Abstract:  Let R be a quotient ring of a commutative coherent regular ring by a finitely generated ideal. Hovey gave a bijection between the set of coherent subcategories of the category of finitely presented R-modules and the set of thick subcategories of the derived category of perfect R-complexes. Using this isomorphism, he proved that every coherent subcategory of finitely presented R-modules is a Serre subcategory. In this paper, it is proved that this holds whenever R is a commutative noetherian ring. This paper also yields a module version of the bijection between the set of localizing subcategories of the derived category of R-modules and the set of subsets of Spec R which was given by Neeman. 
0808.00059	Quantum walk based search algorithms	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Miklos Santha	Abstract:  In this survey paper we give an intuitive treatment of the discrete time quantization of classical Markov chains. Grover search and the quantum walk based search algorithms of Ambainis, Szegedy and Magniez et al. will be stated as quantum analogues of classical search procedures. We present a rather detailed description of a somewhat simplified version of the MNRS algorithm. Finally, in the query complexity model, we show how quantum walks can be applied to the following search problems: Element Distinctness, Matrix Product Verification, Restricted Range Associativity, Triangle, and Group Commutativity. 
0808.00060	Study of Correlation Between Glucose Concentration and Reduced Scattering Coefficients in Turbid media using Optical Coherence Tomography	Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)	Authors:R Poddar, S R Sharma, P Sen, J T Andrews	Abstract:  Noninvasive, non-contact and \textit{in vivo} monitoring of blood glucose is a long needed pathology tool for saving patients from recurring pain and hassle that can accompany conventional blood glucose testing methods. Optical coherence tomography known for its high axial resolution imaging modality is adopted in this article for monitoring glucose levels in tissue like media non-invasively. Making use of changes in reduced scattering coefficient due to the refractive-index mismatch between the extracellular fluid and the cellular membranes and armed with a theoretical model, we establish a correlation between the glucose concentration and reduced scattering coefficient. The scattering coefficients are extracted from the deconvoluted interference signal by using Monte-Carlo simulation with valid approximations. A program code using NI LabVIEW(^{TM}) is developed for automation of the experiment, data acquisition and analysis. 
0808.00061	Theoretical and experimental study of AC loss in HTS single pancake coils	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:J. Šouc, E. Pardo, M. Vojenčiak, F. Gömöry	Abstract:  The electromagnetic properties of a pancake coil in AC regime as a function of the number of turns is studied theoretically and experimentally. Specifically, the AC loss, the coil critical current and the voltage signal are discussed. The coils are made of Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10/Ag (BiSCCO) tape, although the main qualitative results are also applicable to other kinds of superconducting tapes, such as coated conductors. The AC loss and the voltage signal are electrically measured using different pick up coils with the help of a transformer. One of them avoids dealing with the huge coil inductance. Besides, the critical current of the coils is experimentally determined by conventional DC measurements. Furthermore, the critical current, the AC loss and the voltage signal are simulated, showing a good agreement with the experiments. For all simulations, the field dependent critical current density inferred from DC measurements on a short tape sample is taken into account.

The physical result is obtained by making use of generalized $ζ$-function regularization technique. The influence of the mass and the position of the piston in the force is studied graphically. The Casimir force for massive scalar field is compared to that for massless scalar field.

Paumard, R.-R. Rohloff, O. Pfuhl, K. Perraut, J. Ziegleder, D. Rouan, G. Rousset	Abstract:  We present the second-generation VLTI instrument GRAVITY, which currently is in the preliminary design phase. GRAVITY is specifically designed to observe highly relativistic motions of matter close to the event horizon of Sgr A*, the massive black hole at center of the Milky Way. We have identified the key design features needed to achieve this goal and present the resulting instrument concept. It includes an integrated optics, 4-telescope, dual feed beam combiner operated in a cryogenic vessel; near infrared wavefront sensing adaptive optics; fringe tracking on secondary sources within the field of view of the VLTI and a novel metrology concept. Simulations show that the planned design matches the scientific needs; in particular that 10 microarcsecond astrometry is feasible for a source with a magnitude of K=15 like Sgr A*, given the availability of suitable phase reference sources. 
0808.00064	On tabulating virtual strings	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Andrew Gibson	Abstract:  A virtual string can be defined as a closed curve on a surface modulo certain equivalence relations. Turaev defined several invariants of virtual strings which we use to produce a table of virtual strings up to 4 crossings. We discuss progress in extending the tabulation to 5 crossings. We also provide a counter-example to a statement of Kadokami. 
0808.00065	A first principles study on the electronic and magnetic properties of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Jun Dai, Zhenyu Li, Jinlong Yang, J. G. Hou	Abstract:  We report a systematic first-principles study on the recent discovered superconducting Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ systems ($x$ = 0.00, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00). Previous theoretical studies strongly overestimated the magnetic moment on Fe of the parent compound BaFe$_2$As$_2$. Using a negative on-site energy $U$, we obtain a magnetic moment 0.83 $μ_B$ per Fe, which agrees well with the experimental value (0.87 $μ_B$). K doping tends to increase the density of states at fermi level. The magnetic instability is enhanced with light doping, and is then weaken by increasing the doping level. The energetics for the different K doping sites are also discussed. 
0808.00066	Bjorken Sum Rule and pQCD frontier on the move	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Roman S. Pasechnik, Dmitry V. Shirkov, Oleg V.Teryaev	Abstract:  The reasonableness of the use of perturbative QCD notions in the region close to the scale of hadronization, i.e., below $\lesssim 1 \GeV$ is under study. First, the interplay between higher orders of pQCD expansion and higher twist contributions in the analysis of recent Jefferson Lab (JLab) data on the Generalized Bjorken Sum Rule function $Γ_1^{p-n} (Q^2)$ at $0.1<Q^2< 3 {\rm GeV}^2$ is studied. It is shown that the inclusion of the higher-order pQCD corrections could be absorbed, with good numerical accuracy, by change of the normalization of the higher-twist terms. Second, to avoid the issue of unphysical singularity (Landau pole at $Q=Λ\sim 400 \MeV $), we deal with the ghost-free Analytic Perturbation Theory (APT) that recently proved to be an intriguing candidate for a quantitative description of light quarkonia spectra within the Bethe-Salpeter approach. The values of the twist coefficients $μ_{2k} $ extracted from the mentioned data by using the APT approach provide a better convergence of the higher-twist series than with the common pQCD. As the main result, a good quantitative description of the JLab data down to $Q\simeq$ 350 MeV is achieved.

Budhani, Anjan K. Gupta	Abstract:  The electronic density of states (DOS) of La$_{0.625}$Ca$_{0.375}$MnO$_3$(LCMO) strain free epitaxial thin films with an insulator-metal transition temperature (T$_{IM}$) of 250 K was probed using variable temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. We find a depression in the DOS with a finite zero bias conductance (ZBC) signifying a pseudogap (PG) in 78-310 K temperature range. With cooling, the ZBC is found to increase indicating an increased DOS near E$_F$. We interpret PG as a signature of Jahn-Teller polarons while ZBC change, in agreement with the bulk insulator-metal transition, optical Drude peak, and photoemission experiments indicates the presence of free carriers at the Fermi energy in the metallic phase. The free carriers are discussed in terms of correlated polaronic states. 
0808.00068	Interstellar Chemistry: Radiation, Dust and Metals	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Spaans (Kapteyn Astronomical Institute; Groningen, The Netherlands)    	Abstract:  An overview is given of the chemical processes that occur in primordial systems under the influence of radiation, metal abundances and dust surface reactions. It is found that radiative feedback effects differ for UV and X-ray photons at any metallicity, with molecules surviving quite well under irradiation by X-rays. Starburst and AGN will therefore enjoy quite different cooling abilities for their dense molecular gas. The presence of a cool molecular phase is strongly dependent on metallicity. Strong irradiation by cosmic rays (>100x the Milky Way value) forces a large fraction of the CO gas into neutral carbon. Dust is important for H2 and HD formation, already at metallicities of 10^-4-10^-3 solar, for electron abundances below 10^-3. 
0808.00069	Electric-field driven long-lived spin excitations on a cylindrical surface with spin-orbit interaction	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:P. Kleinert	Abstract:  Based on quantum-kinetic equations, coupled spin-charge drift-diffusion equations are derived for a two-dimensional electron gas on a cylindrical surface. Besides the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction, the elastic scattering on impurities, and a constant electric field are taken into account. From the solution of the drift-diffusion equations, a long-lived spin excitation is identified for spins coupled to the Rashba term on a cylinder with a given radius. The electric-field driven weakly damped spin waves are manifest in the components of the magnetization and have the potential for non-ballistic spin-device applications. 
0808.00070	Cosmological evolution of supermassive black holes and AGN: a synthesis model for accretion and feedback	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Andrea Merloni (Excellence Cluster Universe and MPE, Garching)    	Abstract:  The growth of supermassive black holes (SMBH) through accretion is accompanied by the release of enormous amounts of energy which can either be radiated away, as happens in quasars, advected into the black hole, or disposed of in kinetic form through powerful jets, as is observed, for example, in radio galaxies. Here, I will present new constraints on the evolution of the SMBH mass function and Eddington ratio distribution, obtained from a study of AGN luminosity functions aimed at accounting for both radiative and kinetic energy output of AGN in a systematic way. First, I discuss how a refined Soltan argument leads to joint constraints on the mass-weighted average spin of SMBH and of the total mass density of high redshift (z~5) and "wandering" black holes. Then, I will show how to describe the downsizing trend observed in the AGN population in terms of cosmological evolution of physical quantities (black hole mass, accretion rate, radiative and kinetic energy output). Finally, the redshift evolution of the AGN kinetic feedback will be briefly discussed and compared with the radiative output of the evolving SMBH population, thus providing a robust physical framework for phenomenological models of AGN feedback within structure formation. 
0808.00071	Coherent nu-N scattering and the search for physics beyond the standard model	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:J.Barranco	Abstract:  We focus in future proposals to measure coherent neutrino-nuclei scattering and we show that such kind of experiments are very sensitive to nonstandard neutrino interactions with quarks. First in a model independent parametrization and then we focused in particular models such as leptoquarks and models with extra neutral gauge bosons and with R-parity breaking interactions. We show that in all these three different types of new physics it is possible to obtain competitive bounds to those of future collider experiments. For the particular case of leptoquarks we found that the expected sensitivity to the coupling and mass for most of the future experimental setups is quite better than the current constraints. 
0808.00072	European ALMA operations: the interaction with and support to the users	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Paola Andreani, Martin Zwaan	Abstract:  The Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) is one of the largest and most complicated observatories ever built. Constructing and operating an observatory at high altitude (5000m) in a cost effective and safe manner, with minimal effect on the environment creates interesting challenges. Since the array will have to adapt quickly to prevailing weather conditions, ALMA will be operated exclusively in service mode. By the time of full science operations, the fundamental ALMA data product shall be calibrated, deconvolved data cubes and images, but raw data and data reduction software will be made available to users as well. User support is provided by the ALMA Regional Centres (ARCs) located in Europe, North America and Japan. These ARCs constitute the interface between the user community and the ALMA observatory in Chile. For European users the European ARC is being set up as a cluster of nodes located throughout Europe, with the main centre at the ESO Headquarters in Garching. The main centre serves as the access portal and in synergy with the distributed network of ARC nodes, the main aim of the ARC is to optimize the ALMA science output and to fully exploit this unique and powerful facility. The aim of this article is to introduce the process of proposing for observing time, subsequent execution of the observations, obtaining and processing of the data in the ALMA epoch. The complete end-to-end process of the ALMA data flow from the proposal submission to the data delivery is described. 
0808.00073	X(3872) and Other Possible Heavy Molecular States	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Xiang Liu, Zhi-Gang Luo, Yan-Rui Liu, Shi-Lin Zhu	Abstract:  We perform a systematic study of the possible molecular states composed of a pair of heavy mesons such as $D\bar D$, $D^\ast\bar D$, $D^\ast \bar D^\ast$ in the framework of the meson exchange model. The exchanged mesons include the pseudoscalar, scalar and vector mesons. Through our investigation, we find that (1) the structure X(3764) is not a molecular state; (2) There exists strong attraction in the range $r < 1$ fm for the $D^*\bar D^*$ system with $J=0, 1$. If future experiments confirm $Z^+(4051)$ as a loosely bound molecular state, its quantum number is probably $J^{P}=0^+$. Its partner state $Φ^{**0}$ may be searched for in the $π^0χ_{c1}$ channel; (3) The vector meson exchange provides strong attraction in the $D^\ast \bar D$ channel together with the pion exchange. A bound state solution exists with a reasonable cutoff parameter $Λ\sim 1.4$ GeV. X(3872) may be accommodated as a molecular state dynamically although drawing a very definite conclusion needs further investigation; (4) The $B^\ast \bar B$ molecular state exists. 
0808.00074	Measurement of $y_{CP}$ in $D$ meson decays to CP eigenstates	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The Belle Collaboration: I. Adachi, et al    	Abstract:  We present a measurement of the $D^0$-$\overline{D}^0$ mixing parameter $y_{CP}$ using a flavor-untagged sample of $D^0\to K_S^0K^+K^-$ decays. The measurement is based on a 673 fb$^{-1}$ data sample recorded by the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+ e^-$ collider. We find $y_{CP} = (0.21 \pm 0.63 ({\rm stat.})\pm 0.78 (\rm syst.) \pm 0.01(\rm model))%$. 
0808.00075	Optimal Beamforming for Two-Way Multi-Antenna Relay Channel with Analogue Network Coding	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Rui Zhang, Ying-Chang Liang, Chin Choy Chai, Shuguang Cui	Abstract:  This paper studies the wireless two-way relay channel (TWRC), where two source nodes, S1 and S2, exchange information through an assisting relay node, R. It is assumed that R receives the sum signal from S1 and S2 in one time-slot, and then amplifies and forwards the received signal to both S1 and S2 in the next time-slot. By applying the principle of analogue network (ANC), each of S1 and S2 cancels the so-called "self-interference" in the received signal from R and then decodes the desired message. Assuming that S1 and S2 are each equipped with a single antenna and R with multi-antennas, this paper analyzes the capacity region of an ANC-based TWRC with linear processing (beamforming) at R. The capacity region contains all the achievable bidirectional rate-pairs of S1 and S2 under the given transmit power constraints at S1, S2, and R. We present the optimal relay beamforming structure as well as an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal beamforming matrix based on convex optimization techniques. Low-complexity suboptimal relay beamforming schemes are also presented, and their achievable rates are compared against the capacity with the optimal scheme. 
0808.00076	Effects of turbulent mixing on the nonequilibrium critical behaviour	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:N. V. Antonov, V. I. Iglovikov, A. S. Kapustin	Abstract:  We study effects of turbulent mixing on the critical behaviour of a nonequilibrium system near its second-order phase transition between the absorbing and fluctuating states. The model describes the spreading of an agent (e.g., infectious disease) in a reaction-diffusion system and belongs to the universality class of the directed bond percolation process, also known as simple epidemic process, and is equivalent to the Reggeon field theory. The turbulent advecting velocity field is modelled by the Obukhov--Kraichnan's rapid-change ensemble: Gaussian statistics with the correlation function < vv> \propto δ(t-t') k^{-d-ξ}, where k is the wave number and 0<ξ<2 is a free parameter. Using the field theoretic renormalization group we show that, depending on the relation between the exponent ξand the space dimensionality d, the system reveals different types of large-scale asymptotic behaviour, associated with four possible fixed points of the renormalization group equations. In addition to known regimes (ordinary diffusion, ordinary directed percolation process, and passively advected scalar field), existence of a new nonequilibrium universality class is established, and the corresponding critical dimensions are calculated to first order of the double expansion in ξand \varepsilon=4-d (one-loop approximation). It turns out, however, that the most realistic values ξ=4/3 (Kolmogorov's fully developed turbulence) and d=2 or 3 correspond to the case of passive scalar field, when the nonlinearity of the Reggeon model is irrelevant and the spreading of the agent is completely determined by the turbulent transfer. 
0808.00077	Recent Structural Evolution of Early-Type Galaxies: Size Growth from z=1 to z=0	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Arjen van der Wel, Bradford P. Holden, Andrew W. Zirm, Marijn Franx, Alessandro Rettura, Garth D. Illingworth, Holland C. Ford	Abstract:  Strong size and internal density evolution of early-type galaxies between z~2 and the present has been reported by several authors. Here we analyze samples of nearby and distant (z~1) galaxies with dynamically measured masses in order to confirm the previous, model-dependent results and constrain the uncertainties that may play a role. Velocity dispersion measurements are taken from the literature for 50 morphologically selected 0.8<z<1.2 field and cluster early-type galaxies with typical masses 2e11 Msol. Sizes are determined with ACS imaging. We compare the distant sample with a large sample of nearby (0.04<z<0.08) early-type galaxies extracted from the SDSS for which we determine sizes, masses, and densities in a consistent manner, using simulations to quantify systematic differences between the size measurements of nearby and distant galaxies. We find a highly significant structural difference between the nearby and distant samples, regardless of sample selection effects. The implied evolution in size at fixed mass between z=1 and the present is a factor of 1.97(0.15). This is in qualitative agreement with semianalytic models; however, the observed evolution is much faster than the predicted evolution. Our results reinforce and are quantitatively consistent with previous, photometric studies that found size evolution of up to a factor of 5 since z~2. A combination of structural evolution of individual galaxies through the accretion of companions and the continuous formation of early-type galaxies through increasingly gas-poor mergers is one plausible explanation of the observations. 
0808.00078	Structure and phase equilibria of the Widom-Rowlinson model	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:J.M. Brader, R.L.C. Vink	Abstract:  The Widom-Rowlinson model plays an important role in the statistical mechanics of second order phase transitions and yet there currently exists no theoretical approach capable of accurately predicting both the microscopic structure and phase equilibria. We address this issue using computer simulation, density functional theory and integral equation theory. A detailed study of the pair correlation functions obtained from computer simulation motivates a closure of the Ornstein-Zernike equations which gives a good description of the pair structure and locates the critical point to an accuracy of 2 percent. 
0808.00079	Influence of Band and Orbital Degeneracies on Ferromagnetism in the Periodic Anderson Model	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Unjong Yu, Krzysztof Byczuk, Dieter Vollhardt	Abstract:  We investigate the influence of degeneracies of the conduction band and the $f$-orbital on the stability of ferromagnetism in the periodic Anderson model. To this end we calculate the temperature dependence of the inverse susceptibility for different degeneracies $D^c, D^f$ and conduction electron densities $n^c$ within the dynamical mean-field theory. A strong increase of the Curie temperature $T_c$ with the degeneracy $D^f$ of the localized $f$-level is found. For $D^c \leq D^f$ a simple \emph{ansatz} based on a mean-field treatment of the RKKY interaction is shown to imply a scaling behavior of $T_c$ as a function of the conduction electron density per band which is well obeyed by the numerical results. In particular, $T_c$ is found to have a maximum at $n^c / D^c\approx 0.3$. 
0808.00080	Structural precursor to freezing: An integral equation study	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:J.M. Brader	Abstract:  Recent simulation studies have drawn attention to the shoulder which forms in the second peak of the radial distribution function of hard-spheres at densities close to freezing and which is associated with local crystalline ordering in the dense fluid. We address this structural precursor to freezing using an inhomogeneous integral equation theory capable of describing local packing constraints to a high level of accuracy. The addition of a short-range attractive interaction leads to a well known broadening of the fluid-solid coexistence region as a function of attraction strength. The appearence of a shoulder in our calculated radial distribution functions is found to be consistent with the broadened coexistence region for a simple model potential, thus demonstrating that the shoulder is not exclusively a high density packing effect. 
0808.00081	Towards a realistic axion star	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. Barranco, A. Bernal	Abstract:  In this work we estimate the radius and the mass of a self-gravitating system made of axions. The quantum axion field satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation in a curved space-time and the metric components of this space-time are solutions to the Einstein equations with a source term given by the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum operator constructed from the axion field. As a first step towards an axion star we consider the up to the sixth term in the axion potential expansion. We found that axion stars would have masses of the order of asteroids and radius of the order of few centimeters. 
0808.00082	Triviality from the Exact Renormalization Group	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Oliver J. Rosten	Abstract:  Using the exact renormalization group, it is shown that no physically acceptable non-trivial fixed points, with positive anomalous dimension, exist for (i) O(N) scalar field theory in four or more dimensions, (ii) non-compact, pure Abelian gauge theory in any dimension. It is then shown, for both theories in any dimension, that otherwise physically acceptable non-trivial fixed points with negative anomalous dimension are non-unitary. In addition, a very simple demonstration is given, directly from the exact renormalization group, that should a critical fixed point exist for either theory in any dimension, then the n-point correlation functions exhibit the expected behaviour. 
0808.00083	Quantal Effects on Spinodal Instabilities in Charge Asymmetric Nuclear Matter	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:S. Ayik, N. Er, O. Yilmaz, A. Gokalp	Abstract:  Quantal effects on growth of spinodal instabilities in charge asymmetric nuclear matter are investigated in the framework of a stochastic mean field approach. Due to quantal effects, in both symmetric and asymmetric matter, dominant unstable modes shift towards longer wavelengths and modes with wave numbers larger than the Fermi momentum are strongly suppressed. As a result of quantum statistical effects, in particular at lower temperatures, magnitude of density fluctuations grows larger than those calculated in semi-classical approximation. 
0808.00084	On the hitting times of quantum versus random walks	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Frederic Magniez, Ashwin Nayak, Peter C. Richter, Miklos Santha	Abstract:  In this paper we define new Monte Carlo type classical and quantum hitting times, and we prove several relationships among these and the already existing Las Vegas type definitions. In particular, we show that for some marked state the two types of hitting time are of the same order in both the classical and the quantum case. Further, we prove that for any reversible ergodic Markov chain $P$, the quantum hitting time of the quantum analogue of $P$ has the same order as the square root of the classical hitting time of $P$. We also investigate the (im)possibility of achieving a gap greater than quadratic using an alternative quantum walk. Finally, we present new quantum algorithms for the detection and finding problems. The complexities of both algorithms are related to the new, potentially smaller, quantum hitting times. The detection algorithm is based on phase estimation and is particularly simple. The finding algorithm combines a similar phase estimation based procedure with ideas of Tulsi from his recent theorem for the 2D grid. Extending his result, we show that for any state-transitive Markov chain with unique marked state, the quantum hitting time is of the same order for both the detection and finding problems. 
0808.00085	Quark--hadron duality in lepton scattering off nuclei	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Olga Lalakulich, Natalie Jachowicz, Christophe Praet, Jan Ryckebusch	Abstract:  A phenomenological study of quark--hadron duality in electron and neutrino scattering on nuclei is performed. We compute the structure functions $F_2$ and $xF_3$ in the resonance region within a framework that includes the Dortmund-group model for the production of the {f}{i}rst four lowest-lying baryonic resonances and a relativistic mean-field model for nuclei. We consider four-momentum transfers between 0.2 and 2.5 GeV$^2$. The results indicate that nuclear effects play a different role in the resonance and DIS region. We find that global but not local duality works well. In the studied range of four-momentum transfers, the integrated strength of the computed nuclear structure functions in the resonance region, is considerably lower than the DIS one. 
0808.00086	Single Spin Asymmetries on a transversely polarised proton target at COMPASS	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:S. Levorato, for the COMPASS Collaboration	Abstract:  COMPASS is a running fixed-target experiment at the CERN SPS with a rich physics program focused on nucleon spin structure and on hadron spectroscopy. One of the main goals of the spin program is the measurement of the transverse spin effects in semi-inclusive DIS off transversely polarised nucleons. In the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 data have been taken using a 160 $GeV/c$ naturally polarised $μ^{+}$ beam and a deuterium target ($^{6}LiD$) transversely polarised respect to the beam direction. In 2007 the run year has been devoted to collect data with a proton ($NH_{3}$) target. The preliminary results for the Collins and Sivers asymmetries, extracted from the 2007 data with transverse target polarisation, are presented here. Results are also compared with existing model predictions. 
0808.00087	MSSM Higgs Couplings to Bottom Quarks: Two-Loop Corrections	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:David Noth, Michael Spira	Abstract:  We present the two-loop SUSY-QCD corrections to the effective bottom Yukawa couplings within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model. The effective Yukawa couplings include the resummation of the non-decoupling corrections Delta m_b for large values of tg(beta). We have derived the two-loop SUSY-QCD corrections to the leading SUSY-QCD and top-induced SUSY-electroweak contributions to Delta m_b. The scale dependence of the resummed Yukawa couplings is reduced from O(10%) to the per-cent level. These results reduce the theoretical uncertainties of the MSSM Higgs branching ratios to the accuracy which can be achieved at a future linear e+e- collider. 
0808.00088	On the Dynamical Complexity of Small-World Networks of Spiking Neurons	Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)	Authors:Murray Shanahan	Abstract:  A computer model is described which is used to assess the dynamical complexity of a class of networks of spiking neurons with small-world properties. Networks are constructed by forming an initially segregated set of highly intra-connected clusters and then applying a probabilistic rewiring method reminiscent of the Watts-Strogatz procedure to make inter-cluster connections. Causal density, which counts the number of independent significant interactions among a system's components, is used to assess dynamical complexity. This measure was chosen because it employs lagged observations, and is therefore more sensitive to temporally smeared evidence of segregation and integration than its alternatives. The results broadly support the hypothesis that small-world topology promotes dynamical complexity, but reveal a narrow parameter range within which this occurs for the network topology under investigation, and suggest an inverse correlation with phase synchrony inside this range. 
0808.00089	Quantum fluctuations in the mazer	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Jonas Larson	Abstract:  Quantum fluctuations in the mazer are considered, arising either from the atomic motion or from the quantized intracavity field. Analytical results, for both the meza and the hyperbolic secant mode profile, predict for example an attenuation of tunneling resonances due to such fluctuations. The case of a Gaussian mode profile is studied numerically using a wave packet propagation approach. The method automatically takes into account fluctuations in the atomic motion and the dynamics is especially considered at or adjacent to a tunnel resonance. We find that the system evolution is greatly sensitive to the atom-field detuning, bringing about a discussion about the concept of adiabaticity in this model. Further, a novel collapse-revival phenomena is demonstrated, originating from the quantum fluctuations in the atomic motion rather from field fluctuations as is normally the case. 
0808.00090	On varieties of almost minimal degree I: Secant loci of rational normal scrolls	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:M. Brodmann, E. Park	Abstract:  To complete the classification theory and the structure theory of varieties of almost minimal degree, that is of non-degenerate irreducible projective varieties whose degree exceeds the codimension by precisely 2, a natural approach is to investigate simple projections of varieties of minimal degree. Let $\tilde X \subset {\mathbb P}^{r+1}_K$ be a variety of minimal degree and of codimension at least 2, and consider $X_p = π_p (\tilde X) \subset {\mathbb P}^r_K$ where $p \in {\mathbb P}^{r+1}_K \backslash \tilde X$. By \cite{B-Sche}, it turns out that the cohomological and local properties of $X_p$ are governed by the secant locus $Σ_p (\tilde X)$ of $\tilde X$ with respect to $p$. Along these lines, the present paper is devoted to give a geometric description of the secant stratification of $\tilde X$, that is of the decomposition of ${\mathbb P}^{r+1}_K$ via the types of secant loci. We show that there are exactly six possibilities for the secant locus $Σ_p (\tilde X)$, and we precisely describe each stratum of the secant stratification of $\tilde X$, each of which turns out to be a quasi-projective variety. As an application, we obtain the classification of all non-normal Del Pezzo varieties by providing a complete list of pairs $(\tilde X, p)$ where $\tilde X \subset {\mathbb P}^{r+1}_K$ is a variety of minimal degree, $p$ is a closed point in $\mathbb P^{r+1}_K \setminus \tilde X$ and $X_p \subset {\mathbb P}^r _K$ is a Del Pezzo variety. 
0808.00091	Are there the VP couplings in the psi(3770) non-charmed decays hidden behind the current experiment measurements?	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:D. Zhang, G. Rong, J.C. Chen	Abstract:  A global analysis of the full amplitudes for $e^+e^- \to$ VP (Vector and Pseudoscalar) channels at $\sqrt{s}$ =3.773 GeV and 3.670 GeV, which were measured by the CLEO-c Collaboration, shows that those measurements are essentially nontrivial for searching for the $ψ(3770)$ non-$D\bar D$ decays. Unlike the nearly negative verdict on the $ψ(3770)$ strong decays to the VP channels in the original analysis of the CLEO-c data, there exist some unusual solutions that predict the remarkable strength of SU(3) symmetry VP decay of $ψ(3770)$ resonance, which give some clue to understand the mechanism of $ψ(3770)$ non-$D\bar D$ decays and to reexplain the well-known $ρ-π$ puzzle in the J/$ψ$ and $ψ(3686)$ decays. 
0808.00092	A radiation-like era before inflation	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Corrado Appignani, Roberto Casadio	Abstract:  We show that the semiclassical approximation to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the minisuperspace of a minimally coupled scalar field in the spatially flat de Sitter Universe prompts the existence of an initial power-law evolution driven by non-adiabatic terms from the gravitational wavefunction which act like radiation. This simple model hence describes the onset of inflation from a previous radiation-like expansion during which the cosmological constant is already present but subleading. 
0808.00093	The relationship between gas content and star formation rate in spiral galaxies. Comparing the local field with the Virgo cluster	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Fumagalli (1 and 2), G. Gavazzi (1) ((1) Universita di Milano-Bicocca, (2) University of California, Santa Cruz)    	Abstract:  Despite many studies of the star formation in spiral galaxies, a complete and coherent understanding of the physical processes that regulate the birth of stars has not yet been achieved, nor a unanimous consent was reached, despite the many attempts, on the effects of the environment on the star formation in galaxies member of rich clusters. We focus on the local and global Schmidt law and we investigate how cluster galaxies have their star formation activity perturbed. We collect multifrequency imaging for a sample of spiral galaxies, member of the Virgo cluster and of the local field; we compute the surface density profiles for the young and for the bulk of the stellar components, for the molecular and for the atomic gas. Our analysis shows that the bulk of the star formation correlates with the molecular gas, but the atomic gas is important or even crucial in supporting the star formation activity in the outer part of the disks. Moreover, we show that cluster members which suffer from a moderate HI removal have their molecular component and their SFR quenched, while highly perturbed galaxies show an additional truncation in their star forming disks. Our results are consistent with a model in which the atomic hydrogen is the fundamental fuel for the star formation, either directly or indirectly through the molecular phase; therefore galaxies whose HI reservoirs have been depleted suffer from starvation or even from truncation of their star formation activity. 
0808.00094	Homometric Point Sets and Inverse Problems	Metric Geometry (math.MG)	Authors:Uwe Grimm (Milton Keynes), Michael Baake (Bielefeld)    	Abstract:  The inverse problem of diffraction theory in essence amounts to the reconstruction of the atomic positions of a solid from its diffraction image. From a mathematical perspective, this is a notoriously difficult problem, even in the idealised situation of perfect diffraction from an infinite structure. Here, the problem is analysed via the autocorrelation measure of the underlying point set, where two point sets are called homometric when they share the same autocorrelation. For the class of mathematical quasicrystals within a given cut and project scheme, the homometry problem becomes equivalent to Matheron's covariogram problem, in the sense of determining the window from its covariogram. Although certain uniqueness results are known for convex windows, interesting examples of distinct homometric model sets already emerge in the plane. The uncertainty level increases in the presence of diffuse scattering. Already in one dimension, a mixed spectrum can be compatible with structures of different entropy. We expand on this example by constructing a family of mixed systems with fixed diffraction image but varying entropy. We also outline how this generalises to higher dimension. 
0808.00095	Group Invariant Entanglements in Generalized Tensor Products	General Mathematics (math.GM)	Authors:Elemer E Rosinger	Abstract:  The group invariance of entanglement is obtained within a very general and simple setup of the latter, given by a recently introduced considerably extended concept of tensor products. This general approach to entanglement - unlike the usual one given in the particular setup of tensor products of vector spaces - turns out not to need any specific algebraic structure. The resulting advantage is that, entanglement being in fact defined by a negation, its presence in a general setup increases the chances of its manifestations, thus also its availability as a resource. 
0808.00096	Future e^+e^- flavour factories: detector challenges and physics expectations	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Yutaka Ushiroda	Abstract:  Prospects of the two future e^+e^- flavour factories are discussed. The detector designs and the technical challenges are described together with the motivating physics background. 
0808.00097	The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra made effective: an elementary real-algebraic proof via Sturm chains	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Michael Eisermann	Abstract:  Sturm's theorem (1829/35) provides an elegant algorithm to count and locate the real roots of any real polynomial. In his residue calculus (1831/37) Cauchy extended Sturm's method to count and locate the complex roots of any complex polynomial. For holomorphic functions Cauchy's index is based on contour integration, but in the special case of polynomials it can effectively be calculated via Sturm chains using euclidean division as in the real case. In this way we provide an algebraic proof of Cauchy's theorem for polynomials over any real closed field. As our main tool, we formalize Gauss' geometric notion of winding number (1799) in the real-algebraic setting, from which we derive a real-algebraic proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. The proof is elementary inasmuch as it uses only the intermediate value theorem and arithmetic of real polynomials. It can thus be formulated in the first-order language of real closed fields. Moreover, the proof is constructive and immediately translates to an algebraic root-finding algorithm. 
0808.00098	Nonstandard Lorentz-Einstein transformations	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:Bernhard Rothenstein, Stefan Popescu	Abstract:  The standard Lorentz transformations establish a relationship between the space-time coordinates of the same event when detected from two inertial reference frames I and I' in the standard arrangement. This event is characterized by the space-time coordinates E(x,tE) and E'(x',t'E), tE and t'E representing the readings of the standard synchronized clocks C(x) and C'(x') located in the two frames where the event takes place. We obtain the nonstandard Lorentz transformations establishing a "physically" correct relationship between the readings of the standard synchronized clocks and the readings of other clocks (ta,t'a) of the same inertial reference frames. This relationship of the type tE=f(x,ta), expresses the standard Lorentz transformations as a function of ta and t'a respectively. We present several cases of nonstandard Lorentz transformation (the case of radar detection, the case when one reference frame is filled with an ideal transparent dielectric and the case of relativity of the apparent, actual and synchronized positions of the same moving particle). 
0808.00099	Probing the Hofstadter butterfly with the quantum oscillation of magnetization	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:W. H. Xu, L. P. Yang, M. P. Qin, T. Xiang	Abstract:  We have developed a different quantum transfer matrix method to accurately determine thermodynamic properties of the Hofstadter model. This method resolves a technical problem which is intractable by other methods and makes the calculation of physical quantities of the Hofstadter model in the thermodynamic limit at finite temperatures feasible. It is shown that the quantum correction to the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillation of magnetization bears the energy structure of Hofstadter butterfly. The measurement of this quantum correction, which can be materialized on the superlattice or cold atom systems, can reveal unambiguously the Hofstadter fractal energy spectrum. 
0808.00100	Boundary conformal field theories and loop models	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:M. A. Rajabpour	Abstract:  We propose a systematic method to extract conformal loop models for rational conformal field theories (CFT). Method is based on defining an ADE model for boundary primary operators by using the fusion matrices of these operators as adjacency matrices. These loop models respect the conformal boundary conditions. We discuss the loop models that can be extracted by this method for minimal CFTs and then we will give dilute O(n) loop models on the square lattice as examples for these loop models. We give also some proposals for WZW SU(2) models.

Postnikov	Abstract:  Modified Volterra lattice admits two vector generalizations. One of them is studied for the first time. The zero curvature representations, Bäcklund transformations, nonlinear superposition principle and the simplest explicit solutions of soliton and breather type are presented for both vector lattices. The relations with some other integrable equations are established. 
0808.00102	Local temperature in quantum thermal states	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:A. Garcia-Saez, A. Ferraro, A. Acin	Abstract:  We consider blocks of quantum spins in a chain at thermal equilibrium, focusing on their properties from a thermodynamical perspective. Whereas in classical systems the temperature behaves as an intensive magnitude, a deviation from this behavior is expected in quantum systems. In particular, we see that under some conditions the description of the blocks as thermal states with the same global temperature as the whole chain fails. We analyze this issue by employing the quantum fidelity as a figure of merit, singling out in detail the departure from the classical behavior. The influence in this sense of zero-temperature quantum phase transitions can be clearly observed within this approach. Then we show that the blocks can be considered indeed as thermal states with a high fidelity, provided an effective local temperature is properly identified. Such a result originates from typical properties of reduced sub-systems of energy-constrained Hilbert spaces. Finally, the relation between local and global temperature is analyzed as a function of the size of the blocks and the system parameters. 
0808.00103	Use of Astronomical Literature - A Report on Usage Patterns	Digital Libraries (cs.DL)	Authors:Edwin A. Henneken, Michael J. Kurtz, Alberto Accomazzi, Carolyn S. Grant, Donna Thompson, Elizabeth Bohlen, Stephen S. Murray	Abstract:  In this paper we present a number of metrics for usage of the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS). Since the ADS is used by the entire astronomical community, these are indicative of how the astronomical literature is used. We will show how the use of the ADS has changed both quantitatively and qualitatively. We will also show that different types of users access the system in different ways. Finally, we show how use of the ADS has evolved over the years in various regions of the world. The ADS is funded by NASA Grant NNG06GG68G. 
0808.00104	Implications of Recent Measurements of the Milky Way Rotation for the Orbit of the Large Magellanic Cloud	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Genevieve Shattow, Abraham Loeb	Abstract:  We examine the implications of recent measurements of the Milky Way rotation for the trajectory of the Large Magellanic Cloud. The ~ 14+/-6% increase in the MW circular velocity relative to the IAU standard of 220 km/s changes the qualitative nature of the inferred LMC orbit. Instead of the LMC being gravitationally unbound, as has been implied based on a recent measurement of its proper motion, we find that the past orbit of the LMC is naturally confined within the virial boundary of the MW, although still not as tightly bound as in previous estimates. 
0808.00105	The Overlapping Muffin-Tin Approximation	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:M. Zwierzycki, O.K. Andersen	Abstract:  We present the formalism and demonstrate the use of the overlapping muffin-tin approximation (OMTA). This fits a full potential to a superposition of spherically symmetric short-ranged potential wells plus a constant. For one-electron potentials of this form, the standard multiple-scattering methods can solve Schrödingers' equation correctly to 1st order in the potential overlap. Choosing an augmented-plane-wave method as the source of the full potential, we illustrate the procedure for diamond-structured Si. First, we compare the potential in the Si-centered OMTA with the full potential, and then compare the corresponding OMTA $N$-th order muffin-tin orbital and full-potential LAPW band structures. We find that the two latter agree qualitatively for a wide range of overlaps and that the valence bands have an rms deviation of 20 meV/electron for 30% radial overlap. Smaller overlaps give worse potentials and larger overlaps give larger 2nd-order errors of the multiple-scattering method. To further remove the mean error of the bands for small overlaps is simple. 
0808.00106	Magnetic correlations in La2-xSrxCoO4 studied by neutron scattering : possible evidence for stripe phases	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:M. Cwik, M. Benomar, T. Finger, Y. Sidis, D. Senff, T. Lorenz, M. Braden	Abstract:  Spin correlations in LSCO have been studied by neutron scattering. The commensurate antiferromagnetic order of the parent compound persists on a very short range up to a Sr content of x=0.3, whereas small amounts of Sr suppress commensurate antiferromagnetism in cuprates and in nickelates. For x>0.3 we find incommensurate spin ordering with the modulation closely following the amount of doping. These incommensurate phases strongly resemble the stripe phases observed in cuprates and nickelates, but incommensurate magnetic ordering appears only at larger Sr content in the cobaltates due to a reduced charge mobility. 
0808.00107	Hawking radiation for higher dimensional Einstein-Yang-Mills linear dilaton black holes	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:S. Habib Mazharimousavi, I. Sakalli, M. Halilsoy	Abstract:  Recently, Hawking radiation from a $4-$dimensional linear dilaton black hole solution to Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory, via a method of computing exactly the semi-classical radiation, has been derived by Cl\U{e9}ment, et al. Their results show that, whenever solution is available to the massless scalar wave equation, an exact computation of the radiation spectrum leads to the Hawking temperature $T_{H}$. We apply the same method to derive Hawking radiation spectrum for higher dimensional linear dilaton black holes in the Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dilaton (EYMD) and Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theories. Our results show that the radiation with high frequencies for these massive black holes reveal some remarkable information about the $T_{H}$. 
0808.00108	Yang-Baxter deformations and rack cohomology	Quantum Algebra (math.QA)	Authors:Michael Eisermann	Abstract:  Every rack $Q$ provides a set-theoretic solution $c_Q$ of the Yang-Baxter equation. This article examines the deformation theory of $c_Q$ within the space of Yang-Baxter operators over a ring $\A$, a problem initiated by Freyd and Yetter in 1989. As our main result we classify deformations in the modular case, which had previously been left in suspense, and establish that every deformation of $c_Q$ is gauge-equivalent to a quasi-diagonal one. Stated informally, in a quasi-diagonal deformation only behaviourally equivalent elements interact. In the extreme case, where all elements of $Q$ are behaviourally distinct, Yang-Baxter cohomology thus collapses to its diagonal part, which we identify with rack cohomology. The latter has been intensively studied in recent years and, in the modular case, is known to produce non-trivial and topologically interesting Yang-Baxter deformations. 
0808.00109	Similarity versus Coincidence Rotations of Lattices	Metric Geometry (math.MG)	Authors:S. Glied, M. Baake	Abstract:  The groups of similarity and coincidence rotations of an arbitrary lattice L in d-dimensional Euclidean space are considered. It is shown that the group of similarity rotations contains the coincidence rotations as a normal subgroup. Furthermore, the structure of the corresponding factor group is examined. If the dimension d is a prime number, this factor group is an elementary Abelian d-group. Moreover, if L is a rational lattice, the factor group is trivial (d odd) or an elementary Abelian 2-group (d even). 
0808.00110	Global and touchdown behaviour of the generalized MEMS device equation	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Kin Ming Hui	Abstract:  We prove the local and global existence of solutions of the generalized micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) equation $u_t =Δu+λ f(x)/g(u)$, $u<1$, in $Ω\times (0,\infty)$, $u(x,t)=0$ on $\partialΩ\times (0,\infty)$, $u(x,0)=u_0$ in $Ω$, where $Ω\subset\Bbb{R}^n$ is a bounded domain, $λ>0$ is a constant, $0\le f\in C^α(\overlineΩ)$, $f\not\equiv 0$, for some constant $0<α<1$, $0<g\in C^2((-\infty,1))$ such that $g'(s)\le 0$ for any $s<1$ and $u_0\in L^1(Ω)$ with $u_0\le a<1$ for some constant $a$. We prove that there exists a constant $λ^{\ast}=λ^{\ast}(Ω, f,g)>0$ such that the associated stationary problem has a solution for any $0\leλ<λ^*$ and has no solution for any $λ>λ^*$. We obtain comparison theorems for the generalized MEMS equation. Under a mild assumption on the initial value we prove the convergence of global solutions to the solution of the corresponding stationary elliptic equation as $t\to\infty$ for any $0\leλ<λ^*$. We also obtain various conditions for the existence of a touchdown time $T>0$ for the solution $u$. That is a time $T>0$ such that $\lim_{t\nearrow T}\sup_Ωu(\cdot,t)=1$. 
0808.00111	Stay by thy neighbor? Social organization determines the efficiency of biodiversity markets with spatial incentives	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:Florian Hartig, Martin Drechsler	Abstract:  Market-based conservation instruments, such as payments, auctions or tradable permits, are environmental policies that create financial incentives for landowners to engage in voluntary conservation on their land. But what if ecological processes operate across property boundaries and land use decisions on one property influence ecosystem functions on neighboring sites? This paper examines how to account for such spatial externalities when designing market-based conservation instruments. We use an agent-based model to analyze different spatial metrics and their implications on land use decisions in a dynamic cost environment. The model contains a number of alternative submodels which differ in incentive design and social interactions of agents, the latter including coordinating as well as cooperating behavior of agents. We find that incentive design and social interactions have a strong influence on the spatial allocation and the costs of the conservation market. 
0808.00112	Mathematical Structure of Quantum Decision Theory	Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)	Authors:V.I. Yukalov, D. Sornette	Abstract:  One of the most complex systems is the human brain whose formalized functioning is characterized by decision theory. We present a "Quantum Decision Theory" of decision making, based on the mathematical theory of separable Hilbert spaces. This mathematical structure captures the effect of superposition of composite prospects, including many incorporated intentions, which allows us to explain a variety of interesting fallacies and anomalies that have been reported to particularize the decision making of real human beings. The theory describes entangled decision making, non-commutativity of subsequent decisions, and intention interference of composite prospects. We demonstrate how the violation of the Savage's sure-thing principle (disjunction effect) can be explained as a result of the interference of intentions, when making decisions under uncertainty. The conjunction fallacy is also explained by the presence of the interference terms. We demonstrate that all known anomalies and paradoxes, documented in the context of classical decision theory, are reducible to just a few mathematical archetypes, all of which finding straightforward explanations in the frame of the developed quantum approach. 
0808.00113	Complete Linear Series on a Hyperelliptic Curve	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Euisung Park	Abstract:  In this paper we study complete linear series on a hyperelliptic curve $C$ of arithmetic genus $g$. Let $A$ be the unique line bundle on $C$ such that $|A|$ is a $g^1_2$, and let $\mathcal{L}$ be a line bundle on $C$ of degree $d$. Then $\mathcal{L}$ can be factorized as $\mathcal{L} = A^m \otimes B$ where $m$ is the largest integer satisfying $H^0 (C,\mathcal{L} \otimes A^{-m}) \neq 0$. Let $b = {deg}(B)$. We say that \textit{the factorization type of} $\mathcal{L}$ is $(m,b)$. Our main results in this paper assert that $(m,b)$ gives a precise answer for many natural questions about $\mathcal{L}$. 
0808.00114	Measurements of Unpolarized Azimuthal Asymmetries at COMPASS	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:W. Käfer, for the COMPASS collaboration	Abstract:  Azimuthal Asymmetries in unpolarized SIDIS can be used to probe the transverse momentum of quarks inside the nucleon. Furthermore, they give access to the so-far unmeasured Boer-Mulders function. We report on the first measurement of azimuthal asymmetries of the SIDIS cross section from scattering of muons off a deuteron target. 
0808.00115	Importance of the crystalline symmetry in the piezoelectric properties of (K0.44+xNa0.52Li0.04)(Nb0.86Ta0.10Sb0.04)O3+x/2 lead-free ceramics	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:F. Rubio-Marcos, P. Marchet, T. Merle-Mejean, J.F. Fernandez	Abstract:  Lead-free ceramics (K0.44+xNa0.52Li0.04)(Nb0.86Ta0.10Sb0.04)O3+x/2 (x=-0,06) were prepared by conventional solid state sintering. The results indicate a correlation between crystalline symmetry and electrical properties. Higher tetragonality was observed in samples with higher piezoelectric response. As the tetragonality increase the presence of polymorphic phase decrease associated with a reduction of the relaxor behaviour response. The ceramics with c/a = 1.011 ratio exhibit enhanced electrical properties. The Raman spectroscopy showed a certain asymmetry in the paraelectric phase above the Curie temperature Tc that provokes retention of the polarization. The crystalline symmetry plays a crucial role in the piezoelectric properties of the system. 
0808.00116	Inhomogeneous Quantum Quenches	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Spyros Sotiriadis, John Cardy	Abstract:  We study the problem of a quantum quench in which the initial state is the ground state of an inhomogeneous hamiltonian, in two different models, conformal field theory and ordinary free field theory, which are known to exhibit thermalisation of finite regions in the homogeneous case. We derive general expressions for the evolution of the energy flow and correlation functions, as well as the entanglement entropy in the conformal case. Comparison of the results of the two approaches in the regime of their common validity shows agreement up to a point further discussed. Unlike the thermal analogue, the evolution in our problem is non-diffusive and can be physically interpreted using an intuitive picture of quasiparticles emitted from the initial time hypersurface and propagating semiclassically. 
0808.00117	Foliations and Global Inversion	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Eduardo Cabral Balreira	Abstract:  We consider topological conditions under which a locally invertible map admits a global inverse. Our main theorem states that a local diffeomorphism $f: M \to\mathbb{R}^n$ is bijective if and only if $H_{n-1}(M)=0$ and the pre-image of every affine hyperplane is non-empty and acyclic. The proof is based on some geometric constructions involving foliations and tools from intersection theory. This topological result generalizes in finite dimensions the classical analytic theorem of Hadamard-Plastock, including its recent improvement by Nollet-Xavier. The main theorem also relates to a conjecture of the aforementioned authors, involving the well known Jacobian Conjecture in algebraic geometry. 
0808.00118	The effect of differential galactic winds on the chemical evolution of galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Recchi, E. Spitoni, F. Matteucci, G.A. Lanfranchi	Abstract:  (Abridged) The aim of this paper is to study the basic equations of the chemical evolution of galaxies with gas flows. We focus on models in which the outflow is differential, namely in which the heavy elements (or some of the heavy elements) can leave the parent galaxy more easily than other chemical species such as H and He. We study the chemical evolution of galaxies in the framework of simple models. This allows us to solve analytically the equations for the evolution of gas masses and metallicities. We find new analytical solutions for various cases in which the effects of winds and infall are taken into account. Differential galactic winds have the effect of reducing the global metallicity of a galaxy, with the amount of reduction increasing with the ejection efficiency of the metals. Abundance ratios are predicted to remain constant throughout the whole evolution of the galaxy, even in the presence of differential winds. One way to change them is by assuming differential winds with different ejection efficiencies for different elements. However, simple models apply only to elements produced on short timescales, namely all by Type II SNe, and therefore large differences in the ejection efficiencies of different metals are unlikely. Variations in abundance ratios such as [O/Fe] in galaxies, without including the Fe production by Type Ia supernovae, can in principle be obtained by assuming an unlikely different efficiency in the loss of O relative to Fe from Type II supernovae. Therefore, we conclude that it is not realistic to ignore Type Ia supernovae and that the delayed production of some chemical elements relative to others (time-delay model) remains the most plausible explanation for the evolution of alpha-elements relative to Fe. 
0808.00119	Field-Driven Domain-Wall Dynamics in GaMnAs Films with Perpendicular Anisotropy	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Alexandre Dourlat (INSP), Vincent Jeudy (INSP), Aristide Lemaître (LPN), Catherine Gourdon (INSP)    	Abstract:  We combine magneto-optical imaging and a magnetic field pulse technique to study domain wall dynamics in a ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As layer with perpendicular easy axis. Contrary to ultrathin metallic layers, the depinning field is found to be smaller than the Walker field, thereby allowing for the observation of the steady and precessional flow regimes. The domain wall width and damping parameters are determined self-consistently. The damping, 30 times larger than the one deduced from ferromagnetic resonance, is shown to essentially originate from the non-conservation of the magnetization modulus. An unpredicted damping resonance and a dissipation regime associated with the existence of horizontal Bloch lines are also revealed. 
0808.00120	Scattering and binding of different atomic species in a one-dimensional optical lattice	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:R. T. Piil, N. Nygaard, K. Molmer	Abstract:  The theory of scattering of atom pairs in a periodic potential is presented for the case of different atoms. When the scattering dynamics is restricted to the lowest Bloch band of the periodic potential, a separation in relative and average discrete coordinates applies and makes the problem analytically tractable, and we present a number of new results and features compared to the case of identical atoms. 
0808.00121	A note on black hole masses estimated by the second moment in Narrow Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Wei-Hao Bian (1,2), Chen Hu (1), Qiu-Sheng Gu (3), Jian-Min Wang (1) (1 IHEP, 2 NJNU, 3 NJU)    	Abstract:  The second moment of the H$β$ emission line is calculated for 329 narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which is used to calculate the central supermassive black hole (SMBHs) mass of each. We find that the second moment depends strongly on the broader component of the H$β$ line profile. We find that for the NLS1s requiring two Gaussians to fit the H$β$ line the mean value of the SMBH mass from the H$β$ second moment is larger by about 0.50 dex than that from the full width at half maximum (FWHM). Using the gas velocity dispersion of the core/narrow component of \oiii $λ$ 5007 to estimate the stellar velocity dispersion, $σ_{*}$, the new mass makes NLS1s fall very close to the $\mbh - σ_{*}$ relation for normal AGNs. By using $σ_{*}$ measured directly from SDSS spectra with a simple stellar population synthesis method, we find that for NLS1s with mass lower than $10^7 \msun$, they fall only marginally below the $\mbh - σ_{*}$ relation considering the large scatter in the mass calculation.

We show that in this configuration random sample specific and environment-related errors can be avoided. This method relates temperature directly to Boltzmann constant, which will form the basis of the definition of temperature and realization of official temperature scales in the future.

0808.00127	New CP phase of $B_s-\bar B_s$ mixing on ${\rm T}$ violation in $B_{d(s)}\to K^*(φ) \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Chuan-Hung Chen, Chao-Qiang Geng, Lin Li	Abstract:  A large CP-violating phase uncovered recently by CDF and D$Ø$ collaborations in the time-dependent CP asymmetry (CPA) of the $B_s\to J/Ψφ$ decay clearly indicates that a non-Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) phase has to be brought into the $b\to s$ transition. We find that the model with $SU(2)_L$ singlet exotic quarks can not only provide the new phase induced from the Z-mediated flavor changing neutral current (FCNC) at tree level, but also strongly relate the $B_s-\bar B_s$ mixing, $B_q\to V_q \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$ ($V_{d[s]}=K^*[φ])$ and $B_s\to μ^{+} μ^{-}$ together. In particular, we show that the new CP phase can be unambiguously exposed by the large statistical significances of $T$ violating observables in $B_q\to V_q \ell^{+} \ell^{-}$, while the branching ratio of $B_s\to μ^{+} μ^{-}$ can be enhanced to be $O(10^{-8})$.

0808.00129	VW LMi: tightest quadruple system known. Light-time effect and possible secular changes of orbits	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:T. Pribulla, D. Baludansky, P. Dubovsky, I. Kudzej, S. Parimucha, M. Siwak, M. Vanko	Abstract:  Tightest known quadruple systems VW LMi consists of contact eclipsing binary with P_12 = 0.477551 days and detached binary with P_34 = 7.93063 days revolving in rather tight, 355.0-days orbit. This paper presents new photometric and spectroscopic observations yielding 69 times of minima and 36 disentangled radial velocities for the component stars. All available radial velocities and minima times are combined to better characterize the orbits and to derive absolute parameters of components. The total mass of the quadruple system was estimated at 4.56 M_sun. The detached, non-eclipsing binary with orbital period P = 7.93 days is found to show apsidal motion with U approximately 80 years. Precession period in this binary, caused by the gravitational perturbation of the contact binary, is estimated to be about 120 years. The wide mutual orbit and orbit of the non-eclipsing pair are found to be close to coplanarity, preventing any changes of the inclination angle of the non-eclipsing orbit and excluding occurrence of the second system of eclipses in future. Possibilities of astrometric solution and direct resolving of the wide, mutual orbit are discussed. Nearby star, HD95606, was found to form loose binary with quadruple system VW LMi. 
0808.00130	Geant4 validation with CMS calorimeters test-beam data	Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)	Authors:Stefan Piperov (FNAL)    	Abstract:  CMS experiment is using Geant4 for Monte-Carlo simulation of the detector setup. Validation of physics processes describing hadronic showers is a major concern in view of getting a proper description of jets and missing energy for signal and background events. This is done by carrying out an extensive studies with test beam using the prototypes or real detector modules of the CMS calorimeter. These data are matched with Geant4 predictions. Tuning of the Geant4 models is carried out and steps to be used in reproducing detector signals are defined in view of measurements of energy response, energy resolution, transverse and longitudinal shower profiles for a variety of hadron beams over a broad energy spectrum between 2 to 300 GeV/c. 
0808.00131	Cohomology of SL(2,C) character varieties of surface groups and the action of the Torelli group	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Georgios D. Daskalopoulos, Richard A. Wentworth, Graeme Wilkin	Abstract:  We determine the action of the Torelli group on the equivariant cohomology of the space of flat SL(2,C) connections on a closed Riemann surface. We show that the trivial part of the action contains the equivariant cohomology of the even component of the space of flat PSL(2,C) connections. The non-trivial part consists of the even alternating products of degree two Prym representations, so that the kernel of the action is precisely the Prym-Torelli group. We compute the Betti numbers of the ordinary cohomology of the moduli space of flat SL(2,C) connections. Using results of Cappell-Lee-Miller we show that the Prym-Torelli group, which acts trivially on equivariant cohomology, acts non-trivially on ordinary cohomology. 
0808.00132	GHASP : An Halpha kinematic survey of 203 spiral and irregular galaxies - VII. Revisiting the analysis of Halpha data cubes for 97 galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:B. Epinat, P. Amram, M. Marcelin	Abstract:  The GHASP survey (Gassendi HAlpha survey of SPirals) consists of 3D Ha data cubes for 203 spiral and irregular galaxies, covering a large range in morphological types and absolute magnitudes, for kinematics analysis. It is the largest sample of Fabry-Perot data published up to now. In order to provide an homogenous sample, reduced and analyzed using the same procedure, we present in this paper the new reduction and analysis for a set of 97 galaxies already published in previous papers but now using the new data reduction procedure adopted for the whole sample. The GHASP survey is now achieved and the whole sample is reduced using adaptive binning techniques based on Voronoi tessellations. We have derived Ha data cubes from which are computed Ha maps, radial velocity fields as well as residual velocity fields, position-velocity diagrams, rotation curves and kinematical parameters for almost all galaxies. The rotation curves, the kinematical parameters and their uncertainties are computed homogeneously using the new method based on the power spectrum of the residual velocity field. This paper provides the kinematical parameters for the whole sample. For the first time, the integrated Ha profiles have been computed and are presented for the whole sample. The total Ha fluxes deduced from these profiles have been used in order to provide a flux calibration for the 203 GHASP galaxies. This paper confirms the conclusions already drawn from half the sample concerning (i) the increased accuracy of position angles measurements using kinematical data, (ii) the difficulty to have robust determinations of both morphological and kinematical inclinations in particular for low inclination galaxies and (iii) the very good agreement between the Tully-Fisher relationship derived from our data and previous determinations.

0808.00136	Status of Constraints on Supersymmetry	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:A. Freitas	Abstract:  A short summary of constraints on the parameter space of supersymmetric models is given. Experimental limits from high energy colliders, electroweak precision data, flavor and Higgs physics, and cosmology are considered. The main focus is on the MSSM with conserved R- and CP-parity and minimal flavor violation, but more general scenarios and extended models will also be discussed briefly. 
0808.00137	PYRAMIR: Calibration and operation of a pyramid near-infrared wavefront sensor	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:D. Peter, M. Feldt, B. Dorner, T. Henning, S. Hippler, J. Aceituno	Abstract:  The concept of pyramid wavefront sensors (PWFS) has been around about a decade by now. However, there is still a great lack of characterizing measurements that allow the best operation of such a system under real life conditions at an astronomical telescope. In this article we, therefore, investigate the behavior and robustness of the pyramid infrared wavefront sensor PYRAMIR mounted at the 3.5 m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory under the influence of different error sources both intrinsic to the sensor, and arising in the preceding optical system. The intrinsic errors include diffraction effects on the pyramid edges and detector read out noise. The external imperfections consist of a Gaussian profile in the intensity distribution in the pupil plane during calibration, the effect of an optically resolved reference source, and noncommon-path aberrations. We investigated the effect of three differently sized reference sources on the calibration of the PWFS. For the noncommon-path aberrations the quality of the response of the system is quantified in terms of modal cross talk and aliasing. We investigate the special behavior of the system regarding tip-tilt control. From our measurements we derive the method to optimize the calibration procedure and the setup of a PWFS adaptive optics (AO) system. We also calculate the total wavefront error arising from aliasing, modal cross talk, measurement error, and fitting error in order to optimize the number of calibrated modes for on-sky operations. These measurements result in a prediction of on-sky performance for various conditions. 
0808.00138	Subaru and Keck Observations of the Peculiar Type Ia Supernova 2006gz at Late Phases	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Keiichi Maeda, Koji Kawabata, Weidong Li, Masaomi Tanaka, Paolo A. Mazzali, Takashi Hattori, Ken'ichi Nomoto, Alex V. Filippenko	Abstract:  Recently, a few peculiar Type Ia supernovae (SNe) that show exceptionally large peak luminosity have been discovered. Their luminosity requires more than 1 Msun of 56Ni ejected during the explosion, suggesting that they might have originated from super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. However, the nature of these objects is not yet well understood. In particular, no data have been taken at late phases, about one year after the explosion. We report on Subaru and Keck optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of the SN Ia 2006gz, which had been classified as being one of these "overluminous" SNe Ia. The late-time behavior is distinctly different from that of normal SNe Ia, reinforcing the argument that SN 2006gz belongs to a different subclass than normal SNe Ia. However, the peculiar features found at late times are not readily connected to a large amount of 56Ni; the SN is faint, and it lacks [Fe II] and [Fe III] emission. If the bulk of the radioactive energy escapes the SN ejecta as visual light, as is the case in normal SNe Ia, the mass of 56Ni does not exceed ~ 0.3 Msun. We discuss several possibilities to remedy the problem. With the limited observations, however, we are unable to conclusively identify which process is responsible. An interesting possibility is that the bulk of the emission might be shifted to longer wavelengths, unlike the case in other SNe Ia, which might be related to dense C-rich regions as indicated by the early-phase data. Alternatively, it might be the case that SN 2006gz, though peculiar, was actually not substantially overluminous at early times. 
0808.00139	Comments on the Dynamics of the Pais-Uhlenbeck Oscillator	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Andrei V. Smilga	Abstract:  We discuss the quantum dynamics of the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator. The Lagrangian of this higher-derivative model depends on two frequencies. When the frequencies are different, the free PU oscillator has a pure point spectrum that is dense everywhere. When the frequencies are equal, the spectrum is continuous. It is not bounded from below, running from minus to plus infinity, but this is not disastrous as the Hamiltonian is still Hermitian and the evolution operator is still unitary. Generically, the inclusion of interaction terms breaks unitarity, but in some special cases unitarity is preserved. We discuss also the nonstandard realization of the PU oscillator suggested by Bender and Mannheim, where the spectrum of the free Hamiltonian is positive definite, but wave functions grow exponentially for large real values of canonical coordinates. The free nonstandard PU oscillator is unitary when the frequencies are different, but unitarity is broken in the equal frequencies limit. 
0808.00140	A period map for generalized deformations	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Domenico Fiorenza, Marco Manetti	Abstract:  For every compact Kaehler manifold we give a canonical extension of Griffith's period map to generalized deformations, intended as solutions of Maurer-Cartan equation in the algebra of polyvector fields. Our construction involves the notion of Cartan homotopy and a canonical L-infinity structure on mapping cones of morphisms of differential graded Lie algebras. 
0808.00141	Kinematic sub-populations in dwarf spheroidal galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ugur Ural (1), Mark I. Wilkinson (1), Andreas Koch (2), Gerard Gilmore (3), Timothy C. Beers (4), Vasily Belokurov (3), N. Wyn Evans (3), Eva K. Grebel (5), Simon Vidrih (5), Daniel B. Zucker (3) ((1) University of Leicester, (2) UCLA, (3) University of Cambridge, (4) Michigan State University, (5) University of Heidelberg)    	Abstract:  We present new spectroscopic data for twenty six stars in the recently-discovered Canes Venatici I (CVnI) dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We use these data to investigate the recent claim of the presence of two dynamically inconsistent stellar populations in this system (Ibata et al., 2006). We do not find evidence for kinematically distinct populations in our sample and we are able to obtain a mass estimate for CVnI that is consistent with all available data, including previously published data. We discuss possible differences between our sample and the earlier data set and study the general detectability of sub-populations in small kinematic samples. We conclude that in the absence of supporting observational evidence (for example, metallicity gradients), sub-populations in small kinematic samples (typically fewer than 100 stars) should be treated with extreme caution, as their detection depends on multiple parameters and rarely produces a signal at the 3sigma confidence level. It is therefore essential to determine explicitly the statistical significance of any suggested sub-population. 
0808.00142	Ergodic averages with deterministic weights	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Fabien Durand (LAMFA), Dominique Schneider (LAMFA)    	Abstract:  The purpose of this paper is to study ergodic averages with deterministic weights. More precisely we study the convergence of the ergodic averages of the type $\frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} θ(k) f \circ T^{u_k}$ where $θ= (θ(k) ; k\in \NN)$ is a bounded sequence and $u = (u_k ; k\in \NN)$ a strictly increasing sequence of integers such that for some $δ<1$ $$ S_N (θ, u) := \sup_{α\in \pRR} | \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} θ(k) \exp (2iπ αu_k) | = O (N^δ) \leqno{({\cal H}_1)} $$ i.e., there exists a constant $C$ such that $S_N (θ, u) \leq C N^δ $. We define $δ (θ, u)$ to be the infimum of the $δ$ satisfying $\H_1$ for $θ$ and $u$. 
0808.00143	A new fast reconnection model in a collisionless regime	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:David Tsiklauri (University of Salford)    	Abstract:  Based on the first principles (i.e. (i) by balancing the magnetic field advection with the term containing electron pressure tensor non-gyrotropic components in the generalised Ohm's law; (ii) using the conservation of mass; and (iii) assuming that the weak magnetic field region width, where electron meandering motion supports electron pressure tensor off-diagonal (non-gyrotropic) components, is of the order of electron Larmor radius) a simple model of magnetic reconnection in a collisionless regime is formulated. The model is general, resembling its collisional Sweet-Parker analogue in that it is not specific to any initial configuration e.g. Harris type tearing unstable current sheet, X-point collapse or otherwise. In addition to its importance from the fundamental point of view, the collisionless reconnection model offers a much faster reconnection rate (M_c'less=(c/omega_pe)^2 /(r_L,e L)) than Sweet-Parker's classical one (M_sp=S^-1/2). The width of the diffusion region (current sheet) in the collisionless regime is found to be delta_c'less=(c/omega_pe)^2/r_L,e, which is independent of global reconnection scale L and is only prescribed by micro-physics (electron inertial length, c/omega_pe, and electron Larmor radius, r_L,e). Amongst other issues, the fastness of the reconnection rate alleviates e.g. the problem of interpretation of solar flares by means of reconnection, as for the typical solar coronal parameters the obtained collisionless reconnection time can be a few minutes, as opposed to Sweet-Parker's equivalent value of < a day. The new theoretical reconnection rate is compared to the MRX device experimental data by [Yamada et al., Phys. Plasmas, 13, 052119 (2006), Ji et al. GRL, 35, 13106 (2008)] and a good agreement is obtained. 
0808.00144	Bottom-Up Reconstruction Scenarios for (un)constrained MSSM Parameters at the LHC	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:J.-L. Kneur, N. Sahoury	Abstract:  We consider some specific inverse problem or "bottom-up" reconstruction strategies at the LHC for both general and constrained MSSM parameters, starting from a plausibly limited set of sparticle identification and mass measurements, using mainly gluino/squark cascade decays, plus eventually the lightest Higgs boson mass. For the three naturally separated sectors of: gaugino/Higgsino, squark/slepton, and Higgs parameters, we examine different step-by-step algorithms based on rather simple, entirely analytical, inverted relations between masses and basic MSSM parameters. This includes also reasonably good approximations of some of the relevant radiative correction calculations. We distinguish the constraints obtained for a general MSSM from those obtained with universality assumptions in the three different sectors. Our results are compared at different stages with the determination from more standard "top-down" fit of models to data, and finally combined into a global determination of all the relevant parameters. Our approach gives complementary information to more conventional analysis, and is not restricted to the specific LHC measurement specificities. In addition, the bottom-up renormalization group evolution of general MSSM parameters, being an important ingredient in this framework, is illustrated as a new publicly available option of the MSSM spectrum calculation code "SuSpect". 
0808.00145	MHD mode conversion in a stratified atmosphere	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. M. Dee McDougall, Alan W. Hood	Abstract:  Mode conversion in the region where the sound and Alfven speeds are equal is a complex process, which has been studied both analytically and numerically, and has been seen in observations. In order to further the understanding of this process we set up a simple, one-dimensional model, and examine wave propagation through this system using a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. Simulations are carried out in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere with a uniform, vertical magnetic field for both isothermal and non-isothermal cases. For the non-isothermal case a temperature profile is chosen to mimic the steep temperature gradient encountered at the transition region. In all simulations, a slow wave is driven on the upper boundary, thus propagating down from low-beta to high-beta plasma across the mode-conversion region. In addition, a detailed analytical study is carried out where we predict the amplitude and phase of the transmitted and converted components of the incident wave as it passes through the mode-conversion region. A comparison of these analytical predictions with the numerical results shows good agreement, giving us confidence in both techniques. This knowledge may be used to help determine wave types observed and give insight into which modes may be involved in coronal heating. 
0808.00146	H^1 and BMO for certain nondoubling metric measure spaces	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Andrea Carbonaro, Giancarlo Mauceri, Stefano Meda	Abstract:  Suppose that (M,d,m) is an unbounded metric measure space, which possesses two geometric properties, called "isoperimetric property" and "approximate midpoint property", and that the measure m is locally doubling. The isoperimetric property implies that the volume of balls grows at least exponentially with the radius. Hence the measure m is not globally doubling. In this paper we define an atomic Hardy space H1(m), where atoms are supported only on "small balls", and a corresponding space BMO(m) of functions of bounded mean oscillation, where the control is only on the oscillation over small balls. We prove that BMO(m) is the dual of H1(m) and that an inequality of John-Nirenberg type on small balls holds for functions in BMO(m). Furthermore, we show that the Lp(m) spaces are intermediate spaces between H1(m) and BMO(m), and we develop a theory of singular integral operators acting on function spaces on M. Finally, we show that our theory is strong enough to give H1(m)-L1(m) and L1(m)-BMO(m) estimates for various interesting operators on Riemannian manifolds and symmetric spaces which are unbounded on L1(m) and on L\infty(m). 
0808.00147	Combination of CDF and D0 results on the W boson mass and width	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Tevatron Electroweak Working Group	Abstract:  The results on the direct measurements of the W-boson mass and width, based on the data collected by the Tevatron experiments CDF and D0 at Fermilab are summarised and combined. The CDF Run-0 (1988-1889) and Run-I (1992-1995) results have been re-averaged using the BLUE method and combined with Run-I D0 results and the latest published results from CDF taken from the first period of Run-II (2001-2004). The results are corrected to have consistency between the parton distribution functions and electroweak parameters. The resulting Tevatron averages for the mass and total decay width of the W boson are: Mw = 80432 +/- 39 MeV and Gamma_W = 2056 +/- 62 MeV. The inclusion of a preliminary Run-II measurement of Gamma_W from D0 gives Gamma_W = 2050 +/- 58 MeV. 
0808.00148	Eigenvalue bounds, spectral partitioning, and metrical deformations via flows	Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)	Authors:Punyashloka Biswal, James R. Lee, Satish Rao	Abstract:  We present a new method for upper bounding the second eigenvalue of the Laplacian of graphs. Our approach uses multi-commodity flows to deform the geometry of the graph; we embed the resulting metric into Euclidean space to recover a bound on the Rayleigh quotient. Using this, we show that every $n$-vertex graph of genus $g$ and maximum degree $d$ satisfies $λ_2(G) = O((g+1)^3 d/n)$. This recovers the $O(d/n)$ bound of Spielman and Teng for planar graphs, and compares to Kelner's bound of $O((g+1) poly(d)/n)$, but our proof does not make use of conformal mappings or circle packings. We are thus able to extend this to resolve positively a conjecture of Spielman and Teng, by proving that $λ_2(G) = O(d h^6 \log h/n)$ whenever $G$ is $K_h$-minor free. This shows, in particular, that spectral partitioning can be used to recover $O(\sqrt{n})$-sized separators in bounded degree graphs that exclude a fixed minor. We extend this further by obtaining nearly optimal bounds on $λ_2$ for graphs which exclude small-depth minors in the sense of Plotkin, Rao, and Smith. Consequently, we show that spectral algorithms find small separators in a general class of geometric graphs. Moreover, while the standard "sweep" algorithm applied to the second eigenvector may fail to find good quotient cuts in graphs of unbounded degree, our approach produces a vector that works for arbitrary graphs. This yields an alternate proof of the result of Alon, Seymour, and Thomas that every excluded-minor family of graphs has $O(\sqrt{n})$-node balanced separators. 
0808.00149	Structure of derivations on various algebras of measurable operators for type I von Neumann algebras	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:S. Albeverio, Sh. A. Ayupov, K. K. Kudaybergenov	Abstract:  Given a von Neumann algebra $M$ denote by $S(M)$ and $LS(M)$ respectively the algebras of all measurable and locally measurable operators affiliated with $M.$ For a faithful normal semi-finite trace $τ$ on $M$ let $S(M, τ)$ (resp. $S_0(M, τ)$) be the algebra of all $τ$-measurable (resp. $τ$-compact) operators from $S(M).$ We give a complete description of all derivations on the above algebras of operators in the case of type I von Neumann algebra $M.$ In particular, we prove that if $M$ is of type I$_\infty$ then every derivation on $LS(M)$ (resp. $S(M)$ and $S(M,τ)$) is inner, and each derivation on $S_0(M, τ)$ is spatial and implemented by an element from $S(M, τ).$ 
0808.00150	Particle-hole fluctuations in the BCS-BEC Crossover	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:S. Floerchinger, M. Scherer, S. Diehl, C. Wetterich	Abstract:  The effect of particle-hole fluctuations for the BCS-BEC crossover is investigated by use of functional renormalization. We compute the critical temperature for the whole range in the scattering length $a$. On the BCS side for small negative $a$ we recover the Gorkov approximation, while on the BEC side of small positive $a$ the particle-hole fluctuations play no important role, and we find a system of interacting bosons. In the unitarity limit of infinite scattering length our quantitative estimate yields $T_c/T_F=0.264$. We also investigate the crossover from broad to narrow Feshbach resonances -- for the later we obtain $T_c/T_F=0.204$ for $a^{-1}=0$. A key ingredient for our treatment is the computation of the momentum dependent four-fermion vertex and its bosonization in terms of an effective bound-state exchange. 
0808.00151	A photometric redshift of $z=1.8^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ for the \agile GRB 080514B	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Rossi, A. de Ugarte Postigo, P. Ferrero, D. A. Kann, S. Klose, S. Schulze, J. Greiner, P. Schady, R. Filgas, E. E. Gonsalves, A. Küpcü Yoldaş, T. Krühler, G. Szokoly, A. Yoldaş, P. M. J. Afonso, C. Clemens, J. S. Bloom, D. A. Perley, J. P. U. Fynbo, A. J. Castro-Tirado, J. Gorosabel, P. Kubánek, A. C. Updike, D. H. Hartmann, A. Giuliani, S. T. Holland, L. Hanlon, M. Bremer, A. García-Hernández	Abstract:  Aims: The AGILE gamma-ray burst GRB 080514B is the first burst with detected emission above 30 MeV and an optical afterglow. However, no spectroscopic redshift for this burst is known. Methods: We compiled ground-based photometric optical/NIR and millimeter data from several observatories, including the multi-channel imager GROND, as well as ultraviolet \swift UVOT and X-ray XRT observations. The spectral energy distribution of the optical/NIR afterglow shows a sharp drop in the \swift UVOT UV filters that can be utilized for the estimation of a redshift. Results: Fitting the SED from the \swift UVOT $uvw2$ band to the $H$ band, we estimate a photometric redshift of $z=1.8^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$, consistent with the pseudo redshift reported by Pelangeon & Atteia (2008) based on the gamma-ray data. Conclusions: The afterglow properties of GRB 080514B do not differ from those exhibited by the global sample of long bursts, supporting the view that afterglow properties are basically independent of prompt emission properties. 
0808.00152	Measurement of diffusion coefficients of francium and rubidium in yttrium based on laser spectroscopy	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:C. de Mauro, R. Calabrese, L. Corradi, A. Dainelli, A. Khanbekyan, E. Mariotti, P. Minguzzi, L. Moi, S. Sanguinetti, G. Stancari, L. Tomassetti, S. Veronesi	Abstract:  We report the first measurement of the diffusion coefficients of francium and rubidium ions implanted in a yttrium foil. We developed a methodology, based on laser spectroscopy, which can be applied to radioactive and stable species, and allows us to directly take record of the diffusion time. Francium isotopes are produced via fusion-evaporation nuclear reaction of a 100 MeV 18-O beam on a Au target at the Tandem XTU accelerator facility in Legnaro, Italy. Francium is ionized at the gold-vacuum interface and Fr+ ions are then transported with a 3 keV electrostatic beamline to a cell for neutralization and capture in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). A Rb+ beam is also available, which follows the same path as Fr+ ions. The accelerated ions are focused and implanted in a 25 um thick yttrium foil for neutralization: after diffusion to the surface, they are released as neutrals, since the Y work function is lower than the alkali ionization energies. The time evolution of the MOT and the vapor fluorescence signals are used to determine diffusion times of Fr and Rb in Y as a function of temperature. 
0808.00153	A New Hubble Space Telescope Distance to NGC 1569: Starburst Properties and IC 342 Group Membership	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Aaron J. Grocholski, Alessandra Aloisi, Roeland P. van der Marel, Jennifer Mack, Francesca Annibali, Luca Angeretti, Laura Greggio, Enrico V. Held, Donatella Romano, Marco Sirianni, Monica Tosi	Abstract:  We present deep HST ACS/WFC photometry of the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 1569, one of the closest and strongest nearby starburst galaxies. These data allow us, for the first time, to unequivocally detect the tip of the red giant branch and thereby determine the distance to NGC 1569. We find that this galaxy is 3.36 +/- 0.20 Mpc away, considerably farther away than the typically assumed distance of 2.2 +/- 0.6 Mpc. Previously thought to be an isolated galaxy due to its shorter distance, our new distance firmly establishes NGC 1569 as a member of the IC 342 group of galaxies. The higher density environment may help explain the starburst nature of NGC 1569, since starbursts are often triggered by galaxy interactions. On the other hand, the longer distance implies that NGC 1569 is an even more extreme starburst galaxy than previously believed. Previous estimates of the rate of star formation for stars younger than ~ 1 Gyr become stronger by more than a factor of 2. Stars older than this were not constrained by previous studies. The dynamical masses of NGC 1569's three super star clusters, which are already known as some of the most massive ever discovered, increase by ~53% to 6-7x10^5 solar masses. 
0808.00154	Dynamic polarization of single nuclear spins by optical pumping of NV color centers in diamond at room temperature	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:V. Jacques, P. Neumann, J. Beck, M. Markham, D. Twitchen, J. Meijer, F. Kaiser, G. Balasubramanian, F. Jelezko, J. Wrachtrup	Abstract:  We report a versatile method to efficiently polarize single nuclear spins in diamond, which is based on optical pumping of a single NV color center and mediated by a level-anti crossing in its excited state. A nuclear spin polarization higher than 98% is achieved at room temperature for the 15N nuclear spin associated to the NV center, corresponding to $μ$K effective nuclear spin temperature. We then show simultaneous deterministic initialization of two nuclear spins (13C and 15N) in close vicinity to a NV defect. Such robust control of nuclear spin states is a key ingredient for further scaling up of nuclear-spin based quantum registers in diamond. 
0808.00155	On supersymmetry at finite temperature	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Simon Caron-Huot	Abstract:  We consider the effective theories governing the sensitivity to the plasma of certain high-energy observables in supersymmetric plasmas, and point out that they preserve supersymmetry. Our findings generalize previous observations on symptotic thermal masses in weakly coupled plasmas, to both the real and imaginary parts of self-energies, on the light cone and away from it, in weakly and strongly interacting theories. All observed supersymmetry violations due to thermal effects vanish faster than $E^{-2}$ in the high energy limit. 
0808.00156	Authenticated Adversarial Routing	Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)	Authors:Yair Amir, Paul Bunn, Rafail Ostrovksy	Abstract:  The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of authenticated throughput-efficient routing in an unreliable and dynamically changing synchronous network in which the majority of malicious insiders try to destroy and alter messages or disrupt communication in any way. More specifically, in this paper we seek to answer the following question: Given a network in which the majority of nodes are controlled by a malicious adversary and whose topology is changing every round, is it possible to develop a protocol with polynomially-bounded memory per processor that guarantees throughput-efficient and correct end-to-end communication? We answer the question affirmatively for extremely general corruption patterns: we only request that the topology of the network and the corruption pattern of the adversary leaves at least one path each round connecting the sender and receiver through honest nodes (though this path may change at every round). Out construction works in the public-key setting and enjoys bounded memory per processor (that does not depend on the amount of traffic and is polynomial in the network size.) Our protocol achieves optimal transfer rate with negligible decoding error. We stress that our protocol assumes no knowledge of which nodes are corrupted nor which path is reliable at any round, and is also fully distributed with nodes making decisions locally, so that they need not know the topology of the network at any time. 
0808.00157	Multi-Harnack smoothings of real plane branches	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Pedro Daniel Gonzalez Perez (DPTO. ALGEBRA UCM), Jean-Jacques Risler (IMJ)    	Abstract:  We introduce a new method for the construction of smoothings of a real plane branch $(C, 0)$ by using Viro Patchworking method. Since real plane branches are Newton degenerated in general, we cannot apply Viro Patchworking method directly. Instead we apply the Patchworking method for certain Newton non degenerate curve singularities with several branches. These singularities appear as a result of iterating deformations of the strict transforms of the branch at certain infinitely near points of the toric embedded resolution of singularities of $(C,0)$. We characterize the $M$-smoothings obtained by this method by the local data. In particular, we analyze the class of multi-Harnack smoothings, those smoothings arising in a sequence $M$-smoothings of the strict transforms of (C,0) which are in maximal position with respect to the coordinate lines. We prove that there is a unique the topological type of multi-Harnack smoothings, which is determined by the complex equisingularity type of the branch. This result is a local version of a recent Theorem of Mikhalkin. 
0808.00158	Approximate Roots, Toric Resolutions and Deformations of a Plane Branch	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Pedro Daniel Gonzalez Perez (UCM)    	Abstract:  We analyze the expansions in terms of the approximate roots of a Weierstrass polynomial $f$ defining a plane branch $(C,0)$, in the light of the toric embedded resolution of the branch. This leads to the definition of a class of (non equisingular) deformations of a plane branch $(C,0)$ supported on certain monomials in the approximate roots of $f$. As a consequence we find out a Kouchnirenko type formula for the Milnor number $(C,0)$. Our results provide a geometrical approach to Abhyankar's straight line conditions and its consequences. As an application we give an equisingularity criterion for a family of plane curves to be equisingular to a plane branch and we express it algorithmically. 
0808.00159	Front Propagation with Rejuvenation in Flipping Processes	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:T. Antal, D. ben-Avraham, E. Ben-Naim, P.L. Krapivsky	Abstract:  We study a directed flipping process that underlies the performance of the random edge simplex algorithm. In this stochastic process, which takes place on a one-dimensional lattice whose sites may be either occupied or vacant, occupied sites become vacant at a constant rate and simultaneously cause all sites to the right to change their state. This random process exhibits rich phenomenology. First, there is a front, defined by the position of the left-most occupied site, that propagates at a nontrivial velocity. Second, the front involves a depletion zone with an excess of vacant sites. The total excess D_k increases logarithmically, D_k ~ ln k, with the distance k from the front. Third, the front exhibits rejuvenation -- young fronts are vigorous but old fronts are sluggish. We investigate these phenomena using a quasi-static approximation, direct solutions of small systems, and numerical simulations.

0808.00161	Gamma Rays from Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays in Cygnus A	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Armen Atoyan (1), Charles D. Dermer (2) ((1) Concordia University, (2) NRL)    	Abstract:  Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) accelerated in the jets of active galactic nuclei can accumulate in high magnetic field, ~100 kpc-scale regions surrounding powerful radio galaxies. Photohadronic processes involving UHECRs and photons of the extragalactic background light make ultra-relativistic electrons and positrons that initiate electromagnetic cascades, leading to the production of a gamma-ray synchrotron halo. We calculate the halo emission in the case of Cygnus A and show that it should be detectable with the Fermi Gamma ray Space Telescope and possibly detectable with ground-based gamma-ray telescopes if radio galaxies are the sources of UHECRs.

The analysis strategy and the efficiency for selecting the signal and rejecting the background are discussed, focusing on the performance of the lepton identification that can be achieved with the first data of LHC expected in 2008. 
0808.00163	Twice-Ramanujan Sparsifiers	Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)	Authors:Joshua Batson, Daniel A. Spielman, Nikhil Srivastava	Abstract:  We prove that every graph has a spectral sparsifier with a number of edges linear in its number of vertices. As linear-sized spectral sparsifiers of complete graphs are expanders, our sparsifiers of arbitrary graphs can be viewed as generalizations of expander graphs. In particular, we prove that for every $d>1$ and every undirected, weighted graph $G=(V,E,w)$ on $n$ vertices, there exists a weighted graph $H=(V,F,\tilde{w})$ with at most $\ceil{d(n-1)}$ edges such that for every $x \in \R^{V}$, \[ x^{T}L_{G}x \leq x^{T}L_{H}x \leq (\frac{d+1+2\sqrt{d}}{d+1-2\sqrt{d}})\cdot x^{T}L_{G}x \] where $L_{G}$ and $L_{H}$ are the Laplacian matrices of $G$ and $H$, respectively. Thus, $H$ approximates $G$ spectrally at least as well as a Ramanujan expander with $dn/2$ edges approximates the complete graph. We give an elementary deterministic polynomial time algorithm for constructing $H$. 
0808.00164	Vacuum charge fractionlization re-examined	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Y. Nogami	Abstract:  We consider a model of a quantized fermion field that is based on the Dirac equation in one dimensional space and re-examine how the fermion number of the vacuum, or the vacuum charge, varies when an external potential is switched on. With this model, fractionization of the vacuum charge has been illustrated in the literature by showing that the external potential can change the vacuum charge from zero to a fractional number. Charge conservation then appears violated in this process. This is because the charge that has been examined in this context is only a part of the total charge of the vacuum. The total charge is conserved. It is not fractionalized unless the Dirac equation has a zero mode. Two other confusing aspects are discussed. One is concerned with the usage of the continuum limit and the other with the regularization of the current operator. Implications of these aspects of the vacuum problem are explored. 
0808.00165	The Combined NVSS-FIRST Galaxies (CoNFIG) Sample - I. Sample Definition, Classification and Evolution	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. A. Gendre, J. V. Wall	Abstract:  The CoNFIG (Combined NVSS-FIRST Galaxies) sample is a new sample of 274 bright radio sources at 1.4 GHz. It was defined by selecting all sources with S_1.4GHz > 1.3 Jy from the NRAO-VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) in the North field of the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) survey. New radio observations obtained with the VLA for 31 of the sources are presented. The sample has complete FRI/FRII morphology identification; optical identifications and redshifts are available for 80% and 89% of the sample respectively, yielding a mean redshift of ~0.71. One of the goals of this survey is to get better definitions of luminosity distributions and source counts of FRI/FRII sources separately, in order to determine the evolution of the luminosity function for each type of source. We present a preliminary analysis, showing that these data are an important step towards examining various evolutionary schemes for these objects and to confirm or correct the dual population unified scheme for radio AGN. Improving our understanding of radio galaxy evolution will give better insight into the role of AGN feedback in galaxy formation. 
0808.00166	Parity-dependent proximity effect in superconductor/antiferromagnet heterostructures	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:J. W. A. Robinson, Gabor Halasz, M. G. Blamire	Abstract:  We report the effect on the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of a Nb film proximity coupled to the synthetic antiferromagnet Fe/{Cr/Fe}_(N-1). We find that there is a parity dependence of Tc on the total number of Fe layers, N; locally Tc is always a maximum when N is even, and a minimum when N is odd. The Fe electron mean free path and coherence length are indicative of dirty limit behavior; as such, we numerically model our data using the linearized Usadel equations with good correlation. 
0808.00167	Moduli space of CR-projective complex foliated tori	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Costantino Medori, Adriano Tomassini	Abstract:  We study the moduli space of CR-projective complex foliated tori. We describe it in terms of isotropic subspaces of Grassmannian and we show that it is a normal complex analytic space. 
0808.00168	Topological D-branes from Descent	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Aaron Bergman	Abstract:  Witten couples the open topological B-model to a holomorphic vector bundle by adding to the boundary of the worldsheet a Wilson loop for an integrable connection on the bundle. Using the descent procedure for boundary vertex operators in this context, I generalize this construction to write a worldsheet coupling for a graded vector bundle with an integrable superconnection. I then compute the open string vertex operators between two such boundaries. A theorem of J. Block gives that this is equivalent to coupling the B-model to an arbitrary object in the derived category. 
0808.00169	Viscous Cosmology and Thermodynamics of Apparent Horizon	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:M. Akbar	Abstract:  It is shown that the differential form of Friedmann equations of FRW universe can be recast as a similar form of the first law, $T_{h}dS_{h} = dE + WdV$, of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon of FRW universe filled with the viscous fluid. It is also shown that the generalized second law of thermodynamics holds at the apparent horizon of FRW universe and preserves dominant energy condition. 
0808.00170	Integrable Spin Chain of Superconformal U(M)xU(N) Chern-Simons Theory	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Dongsu Bak, Dongmin Gang, Soo-Jong Rey	Abstract:  N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons theory with gauge group U(M)xU(N)} is dual to N M2-branes and (M-N) fractional M2-branes, equivalently, discrete 3-form holonomy at C4/Zk orbifold singularity. We show that, much like its regular counterpart of M=N, the theory at planar limit have integrability structure in the conformal dimension spectrum of single trace operators. We first revisit the Yang-Baxter equation for a spin chain system associated with the single trace operators. We show that the integrability by itself does not preclude parity symmetry breaking. We construct two-parameter family of parity non-invariant, alternating spin chain Hamiltonian involving three-site interactions between 4 and 4* of SU(4). At weak `t Hooft coupling, we study the Chern-Simons theory perturbatively and calculate anomalous dimension of single trace operators up to two loops. The computation is essentially parallel to the regular case M=N. We find that resulting spin chain Hamiltonian matches with the Hamiltonian derived from Yang-Baxter equation, but to the one preserving parity symmetry. We give several intuitive explanations why the parity symmetry breaking is not detected in the Chern-Simons spin chain Hamiltonian at perturbative level. We suggest that open spin chain, associated with open string excitations on giant gravitons or dibaryons, can detect discrete flat holonomy and hence parity symmetry breaking through boundary field. 
0808.00171	Time-Resolved AU-Scale Jets Traced by Masers in the IRAS 4A/B Regions of NGC1333	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Kevin B. Marvel, Bruce A. Wilking, Mark J Claussen, Alwyn Wootten	Abstract:  We present results of VLBI observations of the water masers associated with IRAS 4A and IRAS 4B in the NGC 1333 star-forming region taken in four epochs over a two month period. Both objects have been classified as extremely young sources and each source is known to be a multiple system. Using the Very Long Baseline Array, we detected 35 masers in Epoch I, 40 masers in Epoch II, 35 in Epoch III, and 24 in Epoch IV. Only one identified source in each system associates with these masers. These data are used to calculate proper motions for the masers and trace the jet outflows within 100 AU of IRAS 4A2 and IRAS 4BW. In IRAS 4A2 there are two groups of masers, one near the systemic cloud velocity and one red-shifted. They expand linearly away from each other at velocities of 53 km/s. In IRAS 4BW, masers are observed in two groups that are blue-shifted and red-shifted relative to the cloud velocity. They form complex linear structures with a thickness of 3 mas (1 AU at a distance of 320 pc) that expand linearly away from each other at velocities of 78 km/s. Neither of the jet outflows traced by the maser groups align with the larger scale outflows. We suggest the presence of unresolved companions to both IRAS 4A2 and 4BW. 
0808.00172	Nonlinearity in Bacterial Population Dynamics: Proposal for Experiments for the Observation of Abrupt Transitions in Patches	Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO)	Authors:V. M. Kenkre, Niraj Kumar	Abstract:  An explicit proposal for experiments leading to abrupt transitions in spatially extended bacterial populations in a Petri dish is presented on the basis of an exact formula obtained through an analytic theory. The theory provides accurately the transition expressions in spite of the fact that the actual solutions, which involve strong nonlinearity, are inaccessible to it. The analytic expressions are verified through numerical solutions of the relevant nonlinear equation. The experimental set-up suggested uses opaque masks in a Petri dish bathed in ultraviolet radiation as in Lin et al., Biophys. J. {\bf 87}, 75 (2004) and Perry, J. R. Soc. Interface {\bf 2}, 379 (2005) but is based on the interplay of two distances the bacteria must traverse, one of them favorable and the other adverse. As a result of this interplay feature, the experiments proposed introduce highly enhanced reliability in interpretation of observations and in the potential for extraction of system parameters. 
0808.00173	Why Kohn-Sham and Hartree-Fock orbitals are very close to each other. Shell structure of exchange potential	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:M. Cinal	Abstract:  It is found that, in closed-$l$-subshell atoms, the exact local exchange potential of the density functional theory is very well represented, within the region of every atomic shell, by each of the suitably shifted potentials obtained with the non-local Fock exchange operator acting on the Hartree-Fock (HF) orbitals that belong to this shell. This explains the outstanding proximity of Kohn-Sham and HF orbitals and the high quality of the Krieger-Li-Iafrate and localized HF (or, equivalently, common-energy-denominator) approximations to the exchange potential. 
0808.00174	Simon's Algorithm, Clebsch-Gordan Sieves, and Hidden Symmetries of Multiple Squares	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:D. Bacon	Abstract:  The first quantum algorithm to offer an exponential speedup (in the query complexity setting) over classical algorithms was Simon's algorithm for identifying a hidden exclusive-or mask. Here we observe how part of Simon's algorithm can be interpreted as a Clebsch-Gordan transform. Inspired by this we show how Clebsch-Gordan transforms can be used to efficiently find a hidden involution on the group G^n where G is the dihedral group of order eight (the group of symmetries of a square.) This problem previously admitted an efficient quantum algorithm but a connection to Clebsch-Gordan transforms had not been made. Our results provide further evidence for the usefulness of Clebsch-Gordan transform in quantum algorithm design. 
0808.00175	Vanishing quantum discord is necessary and sufficient for completely positive maps	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:A. Shabani, D.A. Lidar	Abstract:  Two long standing open problems in quantum theory are to characterize the class of initial system-bath states for which quantum dynamics is equivalent to (1) a map between the initial and final system states, and (2) a completely positive (CP) map. The CP map problem is especially important, due to the widespread use of such maps in quantum information processing and open quantum systems theory. Here we settle both these questions by showing that the answer to the first is "all", with the resulting map being Hermitian, and that the answer to the second is that CP maps arise exclusively from the class of separable states with vanishing quantum discord. 
0808.00176	Analytic approximations for transit light curve observables and uncertainties	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Joshua A. Carter, Jennifer C. Yee, Jason Eastman, B. Scott Gaudi, Joshua N. Winn	Abstract:  The light curve of an exoplanetary transit can be used to estimate the planetary radius and other parameters of interest. Because accurate parameter estimation is a non-analytic and computationally intensive problem, it is often useful to have analytic approximations for the parameters as well as their uncertainties and covariances. Here we give such formulas, for the case of an exoplanet transiting a star with a uniform brightness distribution. When limb darkening is significant, our parameter sets are still useful, although our analytic formulas underpredict the covariances and uncertainties. 
0808.00177	Modular compactifications of M_{1,n}	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:David Ishii Smyth	Abstract:  We introduce a sequence of isolated curve singularities, the elliptic m-fold points, and an associated sequence of stability conditions, generalizing the usual definition of Deligne-Mumford stability. For every pair of integers 0<m<n, we prove that the moduli problem of n-pointed m-stable curves of arithmetic genus one is representable by a proper irreducible Deligne-Mumford stack. We also consider weighted variants of these stability conditions, and construct the corresponding moduli stacks. In forthcoming work, we will prove that these stacks have projective coarse moduli and use the resulting spaces to give a complete description of the log minimal model program for M_{1,n}. 
0808.00178	Quantum Interferences in Cooperative Dicke Emission from Spatial Variation of Laser Phase	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Sumanta Das, G.S.Agarwal, Marlan O. Scully	Abstract:  We report generation of a new quantum interference effect in spontaneous emission from a resonantly driven system of two identical two-level atoms due to the spatial variation of the laser phase at the positions of the atoms. This interference affects significantly the spectral features of the emitted radiation and the quantum entanglement in the system. The interference leads to dynamic coupling of the populations and coherences in a basis, determined by the laser phase and represents a kind of vacuum mediated super-exchange between the symmetric and antisymmetric states. 
0808.00179	Energy-momentum Prescriptions in General Spherically Symmetric Space-times	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Saeed Mirshekari, Amir M. Abbassi	Abstract:  Einstein, Landau-Lifshitz, Papapetrou, Weinberg, and Møller energy-momentum prescriptions in general spherically symmetric space-times are investigated. It is shown that for two special but not unusual classes of general spherically symmetric space-times several energy-momentum prescriptions in Schwarzschild Cartesian coordinates lead to some coincidences in energy distribution. It is also obtained that for a special class of spherically symmetric metrics Møller and Einstein energy-momentum prescriptions give the same result for energy distribution if and only if it has a specific dependence on radial coordinate. 
0808.00180	Cubature formula and interpolation on the cubic domain	Numerical Analysis (math.NA)	Authors:Huiyuan Li, Jiachang Sun, Yuan Xu	Abstract:  Several cubature formulas on the cubic domains are derived using the discrete Fourier analysis associated with lattice tiling, as developed in \cite{LSX}. The main results consist of a new derivation of the Gaussian type cubature for the product Chebyshev weight functions and associated interpolation polynomials on $[-1,1]^2$, as well as new results on $[-1,1]^3$. In particular, compact formulas for the fundamental interpolation polynomials are derived, based on $n^3/4 +\CO(n^2)$ nodes of a cubature formula on $[-1,1]^3$. 
0808.00181	1-2-3-flavor color superconductivity in compact stars	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:David Blaschke, Fredrik Sandin, Thomas Klahn	Abstract:  We suggest a scenario where the three light quark flavors are sequentially deconfined under increasing pressure in cold asymmetric nuclear matter, e.g., as in neutron stars. The basis for our analysis is a chiral quark matter model of Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type with diquark pairing in the spin-1 single flavor (CSL) and spin-0 two/three flavor (2SC/CFL) channels, and a Dirac-Brueckner Hartree-Fock (DBHF) approach in the nuclear matter sector. We find that nucleon dissociation sets in at about the saturation density, n_0, when the down-quark Fermi sea is populated (d-quark dripline) due to the flavor asymmetry imposed by beta-equilibrium and charge neutrality. At about 3n_0 u-quarks appear forming a two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) phase, while the s-quark Fermi sea is populated only at still higher baryon density. The hybrid star sequence has a maximum mass of 2.1 M_sun. Two- and three-flavor quark matter phases are found only in gravitationally unstable hybrid star solutions. 
0808.00182	Evidence for color fluctuations in the nucleon in high-energy scattering	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:L. Frankfurt, M. Strikman, D. Treleani, C. Weiss	Abstract:  We study quantum fluctuations of the nucleon's parton densities by combining QCD factorization for hard processes with the notion of cross section fluctuations in soft diffraction. The fluctuations of the small-x gluon density are related to the ratio of inelastic and elastic vector meson production in e-p scattering. A simple dynamical model explains the HERA data and predicts the x- and Q^2-dependence of the ratio. In p-p/pbar-p scattering, fluctuations enhance multiple hard processes (but cannot explain the Tevatron CDF data), and reduce gap survival in central exclusive diffraction. 
0808.00183	Relative Chern character, boundaries and index formulae	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Pierre Albin, Richard Melrose	Abstract:  For three classes of elliptic pseudodifferential operators on a compact manifold with boundary which have `geometric K-theory', namely the `transmission algebra' introduced by Boutet de Monvel, the `zero algebra' introduced by Mazzeo and the `scattering algebra' from [MR95k:58168] we give explicit formulae for the Chern character of the index bundle in terms of the symbols (including normal operators at the boundary) of a Fredholm family of fibre operators. This involves appropriate descriptions, in each case, of the cohomology with compact supports in the interior of the total space of a vector bundle over a manifold with boundary in which the Chern character, mapping from the corresponding realization of K-theory, naturally takes values. 
0808.00184	A Hard X-Ray View of Two Distant VHE Blazars: 1ES 1101-232 and 1ES 1553+113	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A.Reimer (1), L.Costamante (1), G.Madejski (2), O.Reimer (1), D.Dorner (3) ((1)HEPL/KIPAC, Stanford, (2)SLAC/KIPAC, Stanford, (3)Universitaet Wuerzburg)    	Abstract:  TeV blazars are known as prominent nonthermal emitters across the entire electromagnetic spectrum with their photon power peaking in the X-ray and TeV bands. If distant, absorption of gamma-ray photons by the extragalactic background light (EBL) alters the intrinsic TeV spectral shape, thereby affecting the overall interpretation. Suzaku observations for two of the more distant TeV blazars known to date, 1ES 1101-232 and 1ES 1553+113, were carried out in 2006 May and July, respectively, including a quasi-simultaneous coverage with the state-of-the-art Cerenkov telescope facilities. We report on the resulting data sets with emphasis on the X-ray band and set in context to their historical behavior. During our campaign, we did not detect any significant X-ray or gamma-ray variability. 1ES 1101-232 was found in a quiescent state with the lowest X-ray flux ever measured. The combined XIS and HXD PIN data for 1ES 1101-232 and 1ES 1553+113 clearly indicate spectral curvature up to the highest hard X-ray data point (~30 keV), manifesting as softening with increasing energy. We describe this spectral shape by either a broken power law or a log-parabolic fit with equal statistical goodness of fits. The combined 1ES 1553+113 very high energy spectrum (90-500 GeV) did not show any significant changes with respect to earlier observations. The resulting contemporaneous broadband spectral energy distributions of both TeV blazars are discussed in view of implications for intrinsic blazar parameter values, taking into account the gamma-ray absorption in the EBL. 
0808.00185	Detection of Additional Members of the 2003 EL61 Family via Infrared Spectroscopy	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:E.L. Schaller, M.E. Brown	Abstract:  We have acquired near-infrared spectra of Kuiper belt objects 2003 UZ117, 2005 CB79 and 2004 SB60 with NIRC on the Keck I Telescope. These objects are dynamically close to the core of the 2003 EL61 collisional family and were suggested to be potential fragments of this collision by Ragozzine and Brown (2007). We find that the spectra of 2003 UZ117 and 2005 CB79 both show the characteristic strong water ice absorption features seen exclusively on 2003 EL61, its largest satellite, and the six other known collisional fragments. In contrast, we find that the near infrared spectrum of 2004 SB60 is essentially featureless with a fraction of water ice of less than 5%. We discuss the implications of the discovery of these additional family members for understanding the formation and evolution of this collisional family in the outer solar system. 
0808.00186	Circumstantial evidence for a soft nuclear symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Zhigang Xiao, Bao-An Li, Lie-Wen Chen, Gao-Chan Yong, Ming Zhang	Abstract:  Within an isospin- and momentum-dependent hadronic transport model it is shown that the recent FOPI data on the $π^-/π^+$ ratio in central heavy-ion collisions at SIS/GSI energies (Willy Reisdorf {\it et al.}, NPA {\bf 781}, 459 (2007)) provide circumstantial evidence suggesting a rather soft nuclear symmetry energy \esym at $ρ\geq 2ρ_0$ compared to the Akmal-Pandharipande-Ravenhall prediction. Some astrophysical implications and the need for further experimental confirmations are discussed. 
0808.00187	Optical realization of a quantum beam splitter	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:R. Mar-Sarao, H. Moya-Cessa	Abstract:  We show how the quantum process of splitting light may be modelled in classical optics. A second result is the possibility to engineer specific forms of a classical field. 
0808.00188	Compact stellar systems in the Fornax cluster: a UV perspective	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Steffen Mieske, Michael Hilker, Dominik J. Bomans, Soo-Chang Rey, Suk Kim, Suk-Jin Yoon, Chul Chung	Abstract:  In recent years, increasing evidence for chemical complexity and multiple stellar populations in massive globular clusters (GCs) has emerged, including extreme horizontal branches (EHBs) and UV excess. Our goal is to improve our understanding of UV excess in the regime of both massive GCs and ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). To this end, we use deep archival GALEX data of the central Fornax cluster to measure NUV and FUV magnitudes of UCDs and massive GCs. We obtain NUV photometry for a sample of 35 compact objects with -13.5<M_V<-10 mag. Of those, 21 objects also have FUV photometry. Roughly half of the sources fall into the UCD luminosity regime (M_V <=-11 mag). We find that seven out of 17 massive Fornax GCs exhibit a NUV excess with respect to expectations from stellar population models, even for models with enhanced Helium abundance. This suggests that not only He-enrichment has contributed to forming the EHB population of these GCs. The GCs extend to stronger UV excess than GCs in M31 and massive GCs in M87, at the 97% confidence level. Most of the UCDs with FUV photometry also show evidence for UV excess, but their UV colours can be matched by isochrones with enhanced Helium abundances and old ages 12-14 Gyrs. We find that Fornax compact objects with X-ray emission detected from Chandra images are almost disjunct in colour from compact objects with GALEX UV detection, with only one X-ray source among the 35 compact objects. However, since this source is one of the three most UV bright GCs, we cannot exclude that the physical processes causing X-ray emission also contribute to some of the observed UV excess. 
0808.00189	Calibrating Dark Energy	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Roland de Putter, Eric V. Linder	Abstract:  Exploring the diversity of dark energy dynamics, we discover a calibration relation, a uniform stretching of the amplitude of the equation of state time variation with scale factor. This defines homogeneous families of dark energy physics. The calibration factor has a close relation to the standard time variation parameter w_a, and we show that the new, calibrated w_a describes observables, i.e. distance and Hubble parameter as a function of redshift, typically to an accuracy level of 10^{-3}. We discuss implications for figures of merit for dark energy science programs. 
0808.00190	Singularities in loop quantum cosmology	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Thomas Cailleteau, Antonio Cardoso, Kevin Vandersloot, David Wands	Abstract:  We show that simple scalar field models can give rise to curvature singularities in the effective Friedmann dynamics of Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC). We find singular solutions for spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmologies with a canonical scalar field and a negative exponential potential, or with a phantom scalar field and a positive potential. While LQC avoids big bang or big rip type singularities, we find sudden singularities where the Hubble rate is bounded, but the Ricci curvature scalar diverges. We conclude that the effective equations of LQC are not in themselves sufficient to avoid the occurrence of singularities. 
0808.00191	Quantum phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm and supersymmetry	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Subir Sachdev, Xi Yin	Abstract:  We make connections between studies in the condensed matter literature on quantum phase transitions in square lattice antiferromagnets, and results in the particle theory literature on abelian supersymmetric gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions. In particular, we point out that supersymmetric U(1) gauge theories (with particle content similar, but not identical, to those of theories of doped antiferromagnets) provide rigorous examples of quantum phase transitions which do not obey the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm (often referred to as transitions realizing "deconfined criticality"). We also make connections between supersymmetric mirror symmetries and condensed matter particle-vortex dualities. 
0808.00192	What is the largest Einstein radius in the universe?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Masamune Oguri, Roger D. Blandford (KIPAC, Stanford)    	Abstract:  The Einstein radius plays a central role in lens studies as it characterises the strength of gravitational lensing. The distribution of Einstein radii near the upper cutoff should probe the largest mass concentrations in the universe. Adopting a triaxial halo model, we compute expected distributions of large Einstein radii. To assess the cosmic variance, we generate a number of all-sky Monte-Carlo realisations. We find that the expected largest Einstein radius in the universe is sensitive to the cosmological model: for a source redshift z=1, they are 42^{+9}_{-7}, 35^{+8}_{-6}, and 54^{+12}_{-7} arcseconds, assuming best-fit parameters of the WMAP5, WMAP3 and WMAP1 data, respectively. These values are broadly consistent with current observations given their incompleteness. For the same source redshift, we expect in all-sky 35 (WMAP5), 15 (WMAP3), and 150 (WMAP1) clusters that have Einstein radii larger than 20". Whilst the values of the largest Einstein radii are almost unaffected by the primordial non-Gaussianity currently of interest, the abundance of large lens clusters should probe non-Gaussianity competitively with CMB, but only if other cosmological parameters are well-measured. We also find that these "superlens" clusters constitute a highly biased population. For instance, a substantial fraction of these superlens clusters have major axes preferentially aligned with the line-of-sight. As a consequence, the projected mass distributions of the clusters are rounder by an ellipticity of 0.2 and have 40%-60% larger concentrations compared with typical clusters with similar redshifts and masses. We argue that the large concentration measured in A1689 is consistent with our model prediction at the 1.2σlevel. (Abridged) 
0808.00193	The LBT Panoramic View on the Recent Star-Formation Activity in IC2574	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Pasquali, A. Leroy, H.-W. Rix, F. Walter, T. Herbst, E. Giallongo, R. Ragazzoni, A. Baruffolo, R. Speziali, J. Hill, G. Beccari, N. Bouche', P. Buschkamp, C. Kochanek, E. Skillman, J. Bechtold	Abstract:  We present deep imaging of the star-forming dwarf galaxy IC2574 in the M81 group taken with the Large Binocular Telescope in order to study in detail the recent star-formation history of this galaxy and to constrain the stellar feedback on its HI gas. We identify the star-forming areas in the galaxy by removing a smooth disk component from the optical images. We construct pixel-by-pixel maps of stellar age and stellar mass surface density in these regions by comparing their observed colors with simple stellar populations synthesized with STARBURST99. We find that an older burst occurred about 100 Myr ago within the inner 4 kpc and that a younger burst happened in the last 10 Myr mostly at galactocentric radii between 4 and 8 kpc. We analyze the stellar populations residing in the known HI holes of IC2574. Our results indicate that, even at the remarkable photometric depth of the LBT data, there is no clear one-to-one association between the observed HI holes and the most recent bursts of star formation in IC2574. The stellar populations formed during the younger burst are usually located at the periphery of the HI holes and are seen to be younger than the holes dynamical age. The kinetic energy of the holes expansion is found to be on average 10% of the total stellar energy released by the stellar winds and supernova explosions of the young stellar populations within the holes. With the help of control apertures distributed across the galaxy we estimate that the kinetic energy stored in the HI gas in the form of its local velocity dispersion is about 35% of the total stellar energy. 
0808.00194	Mergers and Mass Accretion Rates in Galaxy Assembly: The Millennium Simulation Compared to Observations of z~2 Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Genel, R. Genzel, N. Bouché, A. Sternberg, T. Naab, N. M. Förster Schreiber, K. L. Shapiro, L. J. Tacconi, D. Lutz, G. Cresci, P. Buschkamp, R. I. Davies, E. K. S. Hicks	Abstract:  Recent observations of UV-/optically selected, massive star forming galaxies at z~2 indicate that the baryonic mass assembly and star formation history is dominated by continuous rapid accretion of gas and internal secular evolution, rather than by major mergers. We use the Millennium Simulation to build new halo merger trees, and extract halo merger fractions and mass accretion rates. We find that even for halos not undergoing major mergers the mass accretion rates are plausibly sufficient to account for the high star formation rates observed in z~2 disks. On the other hand, the fraction of major mergers in the Millennium Simulation is sufficient to account for the number counts of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), in support of observational evidence that these are major mergers. When following the fate of these two populations in the Millennium Simulation to z=0, we find that subsequent mergers are not frequent enough to convert all z~2 turbulent disks into elliptical galaxies at z=0. Similarly, mergers cannot transform the compact SMGs/red sequence galaxies at z~2 into observed massive cluster ellipticals at z=0. We argue therefore, that secular and internal evolution must play an important role in the evolution of a significant fraction of z~2 UV-/optically and submillimeter selected galaxy populations. 
0808.00195	Erasing Dark Matter Cusps in Cosmological Galactic Halos with Baryons	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Emilio Romano-Diaz (UK Lexington), Isaac Shlosman (UK Lexington), Yehuda Hoffman (HU Jerusalem), Clayton Heller (GSU)    	Abstract:  We study the central dark matter (DM) cusp evolution in cosmological galactic halos. Models with and without baryons (baryons+DM, hereafter BDM model, and pure DM, PDM model, respectively) are advanced from identical initial conditions. The DM cusp properties are contrasted by a direct comparison of pure DM and baryonic models. We find a divergent evolution between the PDM and BDM models within the inner ~10 kpc region. The PDM model forms a R^{-1} cusp as expected, while the DM in the BDM model forms a larger isothermal cusp R^{-2} instead. The isothermal cusp is stable until z~1 when it gradually levels off. This leveling proceeds from inside out and the final density slope is shallower than -1 within the central 3 kpc (i.e., expected size of the R^{-1} cusp), tending to a flat core within ~2 kpc. This effect cannot be explained by a finite resolution of our code which produces only a 5% difference between the gravitationally softened force and the exact Newtonian force of point masses at 1 kpc from the center. Neither is it related to the energy feedback from stellar evolution or angular momentum transfer from the bar. Instead it can be associated with the action of DM+baryon subhalos heating up the cusp region via dynamical friction and forcing the DM in the cusp to flow out and to `cool' down. The process described here is not limited to low z and can be efficient at intermediate and even high z. 
0808.00196	Using the Energy Spectrum at DAMA/LIBRA to Probe Light Dark Matter	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Spencer Chang, Aaron Pierce, Neal Weiner	Abstract:  A weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) weighing only a few GeV has been invoked as an explanation for the signal from the DAMA/LIBRA experiment. We show that the data from DAMA/LIBRA are now powerful enough to strongly constrain the properties of any putative WIMP. Accounting for the detailed recoil spectrum, a light WIMP with a Maxwellian velocity distribution and a spin-independent (SI) interaction cannot account for the data. Even neglecting the spectrum, much of the parameter space is excluded by limits from the DAMA unmodulated signal at low energies. Significant modifications to the astrophysics or particle physics can open light mass windows. 
0808.00197	Superconductivity in Co-doped SmFeAsO	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Yanpeng Qi, Zhaoshun Gao, Lei Wang, Dongliang Wang, Xianping Zhang, Yanwei Ma	Abstract:  Here we report the synthesis and basic characterization of SmFe1-xCoxAsO (x=0.10, 0.15). The parent compound SmFeAsO itself is not superconducting but shows an antiferromagnetic order near 150 K, which must be suppressed by doping before superconductivity emerges. With Co-doping in the FeAs planes, antiferromagnetic order is destroyed and superconductivity occurs at 15 K. Similar to LaFe1-xCoxAsO, the SmFe1-xCoxAsO system appears to tolerate considerable disorder in the FeAs planes. This result is important, which indicates difference between cuprare superconductors and the iron-based arsenide ones. 
0808.00198	The Brightness of Density Structures at Large Solar Elongation Angles: What is Being Observed by STEREO/SECCHI?	Space Physics (physics.space-ph)	Authors:N. Lugaz, A. Vourlidas, I. I. Roussev, C. Jacobs, W. B. Manchester, O. Cohen	Abstract:  We discuss features of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that are specific to heliospheric observations at large elongation angles. Our analysis is focused on a series of two eruptions that occurred on 2007 January 24-25, which were tracked by the Heliospheric Imagers (HIs) onboard STEREO. Using a three-dimensional (3-D) magneto-hydrodynamic simulation of these ejections with the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), we illustrate how the combination of the 3-D nature of CMEs, solar rotation, and geometry associated with the Thomson sphere results in complex effects in the brightness observed by the HIs. Our results demonstrate that these effects make any in-depth analysis of CME observations without 3-D simulations challenging. In particular, the association of bright features seen by the HIs with fronts of CME-driven shocks is far from trivial. In this Letter, we argue that, on 2007 January 26, the HIs observed not only two CMEs, but also a dense corotating stream compressed by the CME-driven shocks. 
0808.00199	BeamLine Design for MINERvA TestBeam Detector	Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)	Authors:C. E. Pérez, A. M. Gago, J. Morfin, D. A. Jensen, R. Gran	Abstract:  The MINER$ν$A TestBeam Detector calibrations will take place in the MTEST facility at Fermilab. It will use a beam of hadrons between 300 and 1500 MeV/c to analyze the response of the MINERvA detector components. The aim of the present work is to design the beam while considering radiation hazards at the hall. To accomplish this, we are using a Monte Carlo simulation based on Geant4 and actual data taken from measurements of the elements that make up the beamline. 
0808.00200	The Laser Ablation Production of Platinum Nitride and its Possible Structure	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:G. Soto, M.G. Moreno-Armenta	Abstract:  The synthesis of platinum nitride by the laser ablation method is reported. The spectroscopic results show that nitrogen is in interstitial sites of platinum as N-units, contradicting the accepted configuration for PtN2 where it is as N2-units. To elucidate this point we did density functional calculations to correlate composition with nitrogen sites. For dilute nitrogen concentrations, x < 0.2, nitrogen would be in six-fold coordinated sites (octahedral interstices) as N-units. For 0.2 < x < 1.5, nitrogen would be in tetrahedral interstices as N-units. Only for x > 1.5 the N2-configuration in octahedral sites is attained. 
0808.00201	Analytic treatment of leading-order parton evolution equations: theory and tests	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Martin M. Block, Loyal Durand, Douglas W. McKay	Abstract:  We recently derived an explicit expression for the gluon distribution function G(x, Q^2) = xg(x, Q^2) in terms of the proton structure function F_2^{γp} (x, Q^2) in leading-order (LO) QCD by solving the the LO DGLAP equation for the Q^2 evolution of F_2^{γp} (x, Q^2) analytically, using a differential-equation method. We re-derive and extend the results here using a Laplace-transform technique, and show that the singlet quark structure function F_S(x,Q^2) can be determined directly in terms of G from the DGLAP gluon evolution equation. To illustrate the method and check the consistency of existing LO quark and gluon distributions, we used the published values of the LO quark distributions from the CTEQ5L and MRST2001LO analyses to form F_2^{γp} (x, Q^2), and then solved analytically for G(x,Q^2). We find that the analytic and fitted gluon distributions from MRST2001LO agree well with each other for all x and Q^2, while those from CTEQ5L differ significantly from each other for large x values, x>~0.03 - 0.05 at all Q^2. We conclude that the published CTEQ5L distributions are incompatible in this region. Using a non-singlet evolution equation, we obtain a sensitive test of quark distributions which holds in both LO and NLO perturbative QCD. We find in either case that the CTEQ5 quark distributions satisfy the tests numerically for small x, but fail the tests for x>~0.03 - 0.05 - their use could potentially lead to significant shifts in predictions of quantities sensitive to large x. We encountered no problems with the MRST2001LO distributions or later CTEQ distributions. We suggest caution in the use of the CTEQ5 distributions. 
0808.00202	The Degree Distribution of Random k-Trees	Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)	Authors:Yong Gao	Abstract:  A power law degree distribution is established for a graph evolution model based on the graph class of k-trees. This k-tree-based graph process can be viewed as an idealized model that captures some characteristics of the preferential attachment and copying mechanisms that existing evolving graph processes fail to model due to technical obstacles. The result also serves as a further cautionary note reinforcing the point of view that a power law degree distribution should not be regarded as the only important characteristic of a complex network, as has been previously argued. 
0808.00203	Review: galactic angular momenta and angular momentum correlations in the cosmological large-scale structure	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Bjoern Malte Schaefer (IAS/Orsay)    	Abstract:  I review the theory of angular momentum acquisition of galaxies by tidal torquing, the resulting angular momentum distribution, the angular momentum correlation function and discuss the implications of angular momentum alignments on weak lensing measurements: Starting from linear models for tidal torquing I summarise perturbative approaches and the results from n-body simulations of cosmic structure formation. Then I continue to discuss the validity of decompositions of the tidal shear and inertia fields, the effects of angular momentum biasing, the applicability of parameterised angular momentum correlation models and the consequences of angular momentum correlations for shape alignments. I compile the result of observations of shape alignments in recent galaxy surveys as well as in n-body simulations. Finally, I review the contamination of weak lensing surveys by spin-induced shape alignments and methods for suppressing this contamination. 
0808.00204	The Alignment of the ATLAS Silicon Tracker	Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)	Authors:Oleg Brandt	Abstract:  The alignment of tracking detectors is crucial for the physics programme at the LHC, especially for precision measurements like the W mass. The alignment of the ATLAS silicon tracking detectors with a total of 5832 modules poses an unprecedented challenge. In this poster, two track-based alignment algorithms at ATLAS will be covered: the Global chi^2 Algorithm based on chi^2 minimisation, and the Robust Alignment Algorithm based on centering residual distributions. On a time scale of minutes and hours, the geometry of the silicon tracking detectors can be monitored with the Frequency Scanning Interferometry system. An overview of this system will also be given. 
0808.00205	Pumping-Restriction Theorem for Stochastic Networks	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:V. Y. Chernyak, N. A. Sinitsyn	Abstract:  We formulate an exact result, which we refer to as the pumping restriction theorem (PRT). It imposes strong restrictions on the currents generated by periodic driving in a generic dissipative system with detailed balance. Our theorem unifies previously known results with the new ones and provides a universal nonperturbative approach to explore further restrictions on the stochastic pump effect in non-adiabatically driven systems. 
0808.00206	Riding the Spiral Waves: Implications of Stellar Migration for the Properties of Galactic Disks	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Rok Roškar, Victor P. Debattista, Thomas R. Quinn, Gregory S. Stinson, James Wadsley	Abstract:  Stars in disks of spiral galaxies are usually assumed to remain roughly at their birth radii. This assumption is built into decades of modelling of the evolution of stellar populations in our own Galaxy and in external systems. We present results from self-consistent high-resolution $N$-body + Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics simulations of disk formation, in which stars migrate across significant galactocentric distances due to resonant scattering with transient spiral arms, while preserving their circular orbits. We investigate the implications of such migrations for observed stellar populations. Radial migration provides an explanation for the observed flatness and spread in the age-metallicity relation and the relative lack of metal poor stars in the solar neighborhood. The presence of radial migration also prompts rethinking of interpretations of extra-galactic stellar population data, especially for determinations of star formation histories. 
0808.00207	Dynamical formation of correlations in a Bose-Einstein condensate	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Laszlo Erdos, Alessandro Michelangeli, Benjamin Schlein	Abstract:  We consider the evolution of $N$ bosons interacting with a repulsive short range pair potential in three dimensions. The potential is scaled according to the Gross-Pitaevskii scaling, i.e. it is given by $N^2V(N(x_i-x_j))$. We monitor the behavior of the solution to the $N$-particle Schrödinger equation in a spatial window where two particles are close to each other. We prove that within this window a short scale interparticle structure emerges dynamically. The local correlation between the particles is given by the two-body zero energy scattering mode. This is the characteristic structure that was expected to form within a very short initial time layer and to persist for all later times, on the basis of the validity of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the evolution of the Bose-Einstein condensate. The zero energy scattering mode emerges after an initial time layer where all higher energy modes disperse out of the spatial window. We can prove the persistence of this structure up to sufficiently small times before three-particle correlations could develop. 
0808.00208	Electric-field control of a hydrogenic donor's spin in a semiconductor	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:A. De, Craig E. Pryor, Michael E. Flatté	Abstract:  An AC electric field applied to a donor-bound electron in a semiconductor modulates the orbital character of its wave function, which affects the electron's spin dynamics via the spin-orbit interaction. Numerical calculations of the spin dynamics of a hydrogenic donor (Si) embedded in GaAs, using a real-space multi-band k.p formalism, show the high symmetry of the hydrogenic donor state results in strongly nonlinear dependences of the electronic g tensor on applied fields. A nontrivial consequence is that the most rapid Rabi oscillations occur for electric fields modulated at a subharmonic of the Larmor frequency. 
0808.00209	Nonstandard Higgs Decays	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:S. Chang	Abstract:  The crucial search for the Higgs boson at future colliders is capable of discovering the Standard Model Higgs, but is not guaranteed to discover a Higgs that decays nonstandardly. Such new physics is motivated by many aspects; from experiment, by the tension between precision electroweak fits and the LEP2 direct search bound and from theory, by issues of satisfying the LEP2 bound in theories that naturally have a lighter Higgs. The consistent nonstandard Higgs scenario is that the Higgs is lighter than the LEP2 bound and is consistent with direct search limits because the dominant new decays are cascades into a multi-body final state, mediated by new light particles. The reduction in the Standard Model branching ratio implies that searches dependent on these decays can be severely weakened. Thus, it is imperative to design searches capable of discovering the new decays. Some of the possible analyses that can be performed at the Tevatron and LHC are presented. However, much work remains to see if discovery of the nonstandard Higgs at hadron colliders can be ensured. 
0808.00210	Reverse Coherent Information	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Raúl García-Patrón, Stefano Pirandola, Seth Lloyd, Jeffrey H. Shapiro	Abstract:  In this letter we define a family of entanglement distribution protocols assisted by feedback classical communication that gives an operational interpretation to reverse coherent information, i.e., the symmetric counterpart of the well known coherent information. This lead to the definition of a new entanglement distribution capacity that exceeds the unassisted capacity for some interesting channels. 
0808.00211	Twisted Covariant Noncommutative Self-dual Gravity	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:S. Estrada-Jimenez, H. Garcia-Compean, O. Obregon, C. Ramirez	Abstract:  A twisted covariant formulation of noncommutative self-dual gravity is presented. The formulation for constructing twisted noncommutative Yang-Mills theories is used. It is shown that the noncommutative torsion is solved at any order of the $θ$-expansion in terms of the tetrad and some extra fields of the theory. In the process the first order expansion in $θ$ for the Plebański action is explicitly obtained. 
0808.00212	A converse to the Whitehead Theorem	Rings and Algebras (math.RA)	Authors:Pasha Zusmanovich	Abstract:  We show that finite-dimensional Lie algebras over a field of characteristic zero such that their high-degree cohomology in any finite-dimensional non-trivial irreducible module vanishes, are, essentially, direct sums of semisimple and nilpotent algebras. 
0808.00213	Damped wave equations with dynamic boundary conditions	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Delio Mugnolo	Abstract:  We discuss several classes of linear second order initial-boundary value problems, where damping terms appear in the main wave equation as well as in the dynamic boundary condition. We investigate their well-posedness and describe some qualitative properties of their solutions, including boundedness, stability, or almost periodicity. In particular, we are able to characterize the analyticity of certain $C_0$-semigroups associated to such problems. Applications to several problems on domains and networks are shown. 
0808.00214	Southern Cosmology Survey I: Optical Cluster Detections and Predictions for the Southern Common-Area Millimeter-Wave Experiments	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Felipe Menanteau (1), John P. Hughes (1), Raul Jimenez (2,3), Carlos Hernandez-Monteagudo (4), Licia Verde (2,3), Arthur Kosowsky (5), Kavilan Moodley (6), Leopoldo Infante (7), Nathan Roche (8) ((1) Rutgers University (2) ICREA & Institute of Space Sciences (CSIC-IEEC) (3) Princeton University, (4) Max Planck Institut fur Astrophysik, (5) University of Pittsburgh, (6) University of KwaZulu-Natal, (7) P. Universidad Catolica de Chile, (8) University of Pennsylvania)    	Abstract:  We present first results from the Southern Cosmology Survey, a new multiwavelength survey of the southern sky coordinated with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), a recently commissioned ground-based mm-band Cosmic Microwave Background experiment. This article presents a full analysis of archival optical multi-band imaging data covering an 8 square degree region near right ascension 23 hours and declination -55 degrees, obtained by the Blanco 4-m telescope and Mosaic-II camera in late 2005. We describe the pipeline we have developed to process this large data volume, obtain accurate photometric redshifts, and detect optical clusters. Our cluster finding process uses the combination of a matched spatial filter, photometric redshift probability distributions and richness estimation. We present photometric redshifts, richness estimates, luminosities, and masses for 8 new optically-selected clusters with mass greater than $3\times10^{14}M_{\sun}$ at redshifts out to 0.7. We also present estimates for the expected Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) signal from these clusters as specific predictions for upcoming observations by ACT, the South Pole Telescope and Atacama Pathfinder Experiment. 
0808.00215	A new strategy to conceal an object from electromagnetic wave	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Yu Luo, Jingjing Zhang, Hongsheng Chen, Bae-Ian Wu, Jin Au Kong	Abstract:  A new recipe for concealing objects from detection is suggested. Different with traditional cloak which deflects light around the core of the cloak to make the object inside invisible, our cloak guides the light to penetrate the core of the cloak but without striking some region of the cloak shell - the so called folded region. Full wave analytical calculation shows that this cloak will lead to a scattering enhancement instead of scattering reduction in contrast to the traditional cloak; the scattered field distribution can also be changed as if the scatterer is moved from its original position. Such interesting phenomenon indicates the proposed cloak can be used to disguise the true information of the object, e.g. the position, the size, etc, and further mislead the observer and avoid being detected. 
0808.00216	Thermoelectric efficiency at maximum power in a quantum dot	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Massimiliano Esposito, Katja Lindenberg, Christian Van den Broeck	Abstract:  We identify the operational conditions for maximum power of a nanothermoelectric engine consisting of a single quantum level embedded between two leads at different temperatures and chemical potentials. The corresponding thermodynamic efficiency agrees with the Curzon-Ahlborn expression up to quadratic terms in the gradients, supporting the thesis of universality beyond linear response. 
0808.00217	The second homology group of current Lie algebras	K-Theory and Homology (math.KT)	Authors:Pasha Zusmanovich	Abstract:  This is an old paper put here for archeological purposes. We derive a general formula expressing the second homology of a Lie algebra of the form L\otimes A with coefficients in the trivial module through homology of $L$, cyclic homology of $A$, and other invariants of $L$ and $A$. This is achieved by using the Hopf formula expressing the second homology of a Lie algebra in terms of its presentation. We also derive a similar formula for the associated Lie algebra of the tensor product of two associative algebras. 
0808.00218	W and Z properties at the Tevatron	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Emily Nurse (the CDF and D0 collaborations)    	Abstract:  I present measurements of W and Z boson properties by the CDF and D0 collaborations. This includes measurements that test the production mechanism of the bosons and precision measurements of electroweak parameters. In the former category I present CDF measurements of the Z rapidity and W charge asymmetry that will help further constrain Parton Distribution Functions in future global fits, and a D0 measurement of the Z transverse momentum distribution that can be used to test the predictions of quantum-chromodynamics. In the later category I present a D0 measurement of the Z/gamma* forward-backward asymmetry and the subsequent extraction sin2theta_W = 0.2327 +/- 0.0018 (stat.) +/- 0.0006 (syst.) and a CDF measurement of the W width Gamma_W using a fit to the tail of the W transverse mass distribution in W->enu and W->munu events that yields Gamma_W = 2032 +/- 73 MeV. 
0808.00219	Observation of Neutrons with a Gadolinium Doped Water Cerenkov Detector	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:S. Dazeley, A. Bernstein, N. S. Bowden, R. Svoboda	Abstract:  Spontaneous and induced fission in Special Nuclear Material (SNM) such as 235U and 239Pu results in the emission of neutrons and high energy gamma-rays. The multiplicities of and time correlations between these particles are both powerful indicators of the presence of fissile material. Detectors sensitive to these signatures are consequently useful for nuclear material monitoring, search, and characterization. In this article, we demonstrate sensitivity to both high energy gamma-rays and neutrons with a water Cerenkov based detector. Electrons in the detector medium, scattered by gamma-ray interactions, are detected by their Cerenkov light emission. Sensitivity to neutrons is enhanced by the addition of a gadolinium compound to the water in low concentrations. Cerenkov light is similarly produced by an 8 MeV gamma-ray cascade following neutron capture on the gadolinium. The large solid angle coverage and high intrinsic efficiency of this detection approach can provide robust and low cost neutron and gamma-ray detection with a single device. 
0808.00220	Towards Kinetic Modeling of Global Metabolic Networks with Incomplete Experimental Input on Kinetic Parameters	Molecular Networks (q-bio.MN)	Authors:P. Ao, L.W. Lee, Me Lidstrom, L. Yin, X. M. Zhu	Abstract:  This is the first report, to our knowledge, on a systematic method for constructing a large scale kinetic metabolic model with incomplete information on kinetic parametersr, and its initial application to the modeling of central metabolism of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1, a methylotrophic and environmental important bacterium, with all necessary constraints. Through a systematic and consistent procedure of finding a set of parameters in the physiological range we overcome an outstanding difficulty in large scale kinetic modeling: the requirement for a massive number of enzymatic reaction parameters. We are able to construct the kinetic model based on general biological considerations and incomplete experimental kinetic parameters. The success of our approach with incompletely input information is guaranteed by two known principles in biology, the robustness of the system and the cooperation among its various parts. (Will be pleased to be informed on other methodologies dealing with same type of problems: aoping@u.washington.edu) 
0808.00221	Extended Chaos Theory and Multiparticle Production	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:Yi-Fang Chang	Abstract:  First, using the method of the soliton-solution, the fermion probability density equation, which corresponds to the Dirac equation, is derived. Next, we extend the chaos theory, in which the period bifurcation is equivalent to the particle production. Then this extended chaos theory can be used for description of the multiparticle production and the extensive air showers at high energy. Let the parameter takes a suitable value, the quantitative results will be obtained, and an approximate formula will be derived. Many properties of the multiparticle production and of the chaos theory are universal. 
0808.00222	Top Mass Measurements from Jets and the Tevatron Top-Quark Mass	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Andre H. Hoang, Iain W. Stewart	Abstract:  Theoretical issues are discussed for the measurement of the top-mass using jets, including perturbative and non-perturbative effects that relate experimental observables to the Lagrangian mass, and appropriate choices for mass schemes. Full account for these issues is given for e+e--> t-tbar using a factorization theorem for event shapes for massive quarks. Implications for the Tevatron top-mass measurement are discussed. A mass-scheme, the "MSR-mass", is introduced which allows for a precise description of observables sensitive to scales R << m, but at the same time does not introduce perturbative matching uncertainties in conversion to the MSbar mass. 
0808.00223	Ultra High Energy Cosmic Ray Puzzle and the Plasma Wakefield Acceleration	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Feng-Yin Chang, Pisin Chen, Guey-Lin Lin, Robert J. Noble, Kevin Reil, Richard Sydora	Abstract:  Magnetowave induced plasma wakefield acceleration (MPWA) in a relativistic astrophysical outflow has been proposed as a viable mechanism for the acceleration of cosmic particles to ultra high energies. Here we present simulation results that demonstrate the viability of this mechanism. We invoke the high frequency and high speed whistler mode for the driving pulse. The plasma wakefield so induced validates precisely the theoretical prediction. This mechanism is shown capable of accelerating charged particles to ZeV energies in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). 
0808.00224	Diffraction microtomography with sample rotation: influence of a missing apple core in the recorded frequency space	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Stanislas Vertu (1), Jean-Jacques Delaunay (1), Olivier Haeberle (2) ((1) Department of Engineering Synthesis, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, (2) Laboratory MIPS- University of Haute Alsace, IUT Mulhouse)    	Abstract:  Diffraction microtomography in coherent light is foreseen as a promising technique to image transparent living samples in three dimensions without staining. Contrary to conventional microscopy with incoherent light, which gives morphological information only, diffraction microtomography makes it possible to obtain the complex optical refractive index of the observed sample by mapping a three-dimensional support in the spatial frequency domain. The technique can be implemented in two configurations, namely, by varying the sample illumination with a fixed sample or by rotating the sample using a fixed illumination. In the literature, only the former method was described in detail. In this report, we precisely derive the three-dimensional frequency support that can be mapped by the sample rotation configuration. We found that, within the first-order Born approximation, the volume of the frequency domain that can be mapped exhibits a missing part, the shape of which resembles that of an apple core. The projection of the diffracted waves in the frequency space onto the set of sphere caps covered by the sample rotation does not allow for a complete mapping of the frequency along the axis of rotation due to the finite radius of the sphere caps. We present simulations of the effects of this missing information on the reconstruction of ideal objects. 
0808.00225	Contradiction between strong lensing statistics and a feedback solution to the cusp/core problem	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Da-Ming Chen, Stacy McGaugh	Abstract:  Standard cosmology has many successes on large scales, but faces some fundamental difficulties on small, galactic scales. One such difficulty is the cusp/core problem. High resolution observations of the rotation curves for dark matter dominated low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies imply that galactic dark matter halos have a density profile with a flat central core, whereas N-body structure formation simulations predict a divergent (cuspy) density profile at the center. It has been proposed that this problem can be resolved by stellar feedback driving turbulent gas motion that erases the initial cusp. However, strong gravitational lensing prefers a cuspy density profile for galactic halos. In this paper, we use the most recent high resolution observations of the rotation curves of LSB galaxies to fit the core size as a function of halo mass, and compare the resultant lensing probability to the observational results for the well defined combined sample of the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) and Jodrell Bank/Very Large Array Astrometric Survey (JVAS). The lensing probabilities based on such density profiles are too low to match the observed lensing in CLASS/JVAS. High baryon densities in the galaxies that dominate the lensing statistics can reconcile this discrepancy, but only if they steepen the mass profile rather than making it more shallow. This places contradictory demands upon the effects of baryons on the central mass profiles of galaxies. 
0808.00226	Search for Technicolor Particles Produced in Association with W Boson at CDF	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Y. Nagai, T. Masubuchi, S. Kim, W.-M. Yao	Abstract:  We present a search for technicolor particles decaying into $b\bar b$, $b\bar c$ or $b\bar u$ and produced in association with $W$ bosons in $p\bar p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}= 1.96 \mathrm{TeV}$. The search uses approximately $1.9 \mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of the dataset accumulated in the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. We select events matching the $W$ + 2-jets signature and require at least one jets to be identified as $b$-quark jets. In the case of exactly one vertex $b$-tagged events, we apply a neural network flavor separator to reject contamination from charm and light quark jets. The number of tagged events and the invariant mass distributions of $W+2$ jets and dijets are consistent with the Standard Model expectations. We succeed to set a large 95% confidence level excluded region on the $π_{T}$ mass v.s. $ρ_{T}$ mass plane. 
0808.00227	Algebraic Bethe ansatz approach to the asymptotic behavior of correlation functions	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:N. Kitanine (LPTM), K. K. Kozlowski (Phys-ENS), J. M. Maillet (Phys-ENS), N. A. Slavnov (SMI), V. Terras (Phys-ENS, LPTA)    	Abstract:  We describe a method to derive, from first principles, the long-distance asymptotic behavior of correlation functions of integrable models in the framework of the algebraic Bethe ansatz. We apply this approach to the longitudinal spin- spin correlation function of the XXZ Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain (with magnetic field) in the disordered regime as well as to the density-density correlation func- tion of the interacting one-dimensional Bose gas. At leading order, the results confirm the Luttinger liquid and conformal field theory predictions. 
0808.00228	Non-variational computation of the eigenstates of Dirac operators with radially symmetric potentials	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Lyonell Boulton, Nabile Boussaid (LM-Besan\c{c}on)    	Abstract:  We discuss a novel strategy for computing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the relativistic Dirac operator with a radially symmetric potential. The virtues of this strategy lie on the fact that it avoids completely the phenomenon of spectral pollution and it always provides two-side estimates for the eigenvalues with explicit error bounds on both eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. We also discuss convergence rates of the method as well as illustrate our results with various numerical experiments. 
0808.00229	The Quantum Refrigerator: The quest for absolute zero	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Yair Rezek, Peter Salamon, Karl Heinz Hoffmann, Ronnie Kosloff	Abstract:  The scaling of the optimal cooling power of a reciprocating quantum refrigerator is sought as a function of the cold bath temperature as $T_c \to 0$. The working medium consists of noninteracting particles in a harmonic potential. Two closed-form solutions of the refrigeration cycle are analyzed, and compared to a numerical optimization scheme, focusing on cooling toward zero temperature. The optimal cycle is characterized by linear relations between the heat extracted from the cold bath, the energy level spacing of the working medium and the temperature. The scaling of the optimal cooling rate is found to be proportional to $T_c^{3/2}$ giving a dynamical interpretation to the third law of thermodynamics.

Harris	Abstract:  We use the Stokes photon of a biphoton pair to set the time origin for electro-optic modulation of the wave function of the anti-Stokes photon thereby allowing arbitrary phase and amplitude modulation. We demonstrate conditional single-photon wave functions composed of several pulses, or instead, having gaussian or exponential shapes. 
0808.00231	Superconductivity of hexagonal heavily-boron doped silicon carbide	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:M. Kriener, T. Muranaka, Z.-A. Ren, J. Kato, J. Akimitsu, Y. Maeno	Abstract:  In 2004 the discovery of superconductivity in heavily boron-doped diamond (C:B) led to an increasing interest in the superconducting phases of wide-gap semiconductors. Subsequently superconductivity was found in heavily boron-doped cubic silicon (Si:B) and recently in the stochiometric ''mixture'' of heavily boron-doped silicon carbide (SiC:B). The latter system surprisingly exhibits type-I superconductivity in contrast to the type-II superconductors C:B and Si:B. Here we will focus on the specific heat of two different superconducting samples of boron-doped SiC. One of them contains cubic and hexagonal SiC whereas the other consists mainly of hexagonal SiC without any detectable cubic phase fraction. The electronic specific heat in the superconducting state of both samples SiC:B can be described by either assuming a BCS-type exponentional temperature dependence or a power-law behavior. 
0808.00232	B-Meson Wave Function through A Comparative Analysis of the $B\to π$, $K$ Transition Form Factors	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Dai-Min Zeng, Xing-Gang Wu, Zhen-Yun Fang	Abstract:  The properties of the B-meson light-cone wave function up to next-to-leading order Fock state expansion have been studied through a comparative study of the $B\to π$, $K$ transition form factors within the $k_T$ factorization approach and the light-cone sum rule analysis. The transition form factors $F^{B\toπ}_{+,0,T}$ and $F^{B\to K}_{+,0,T}$ are carefully re-calculated up to ${\cal O}(1/m_b^2)$ within the $k_T$ factorization approach in the large recoil region, in which the main theoretical uncertainties are discussed. The QCD light-cone sum rule is applicable in the large and intermediate energy regions, and the QCD light-cone sum rule results in Ref.\cite{sumrule} are adopted for such a comparative study. It is found that when the two phenomenological parameters $\barΛ\in [0.50,0.55]$ and $δ\in[0.25,0.30]$, the results of $F^{B\toπ}_{+,0,T}(Q^2)$ and $F^{B\to K}_{+,0,T}(Q^2)$ from these two approaches are consistent with each other in the large recoil energy region. 
0808.00233	Cluster formation in compact stars: relativistic versus Skyrme models	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Camille Ducoin (LPCC), Constança Providência, Alexandro M. Santos, Lucilia Brito, Philippe Chomaz (GANIL)    	Abstract:  We present various properties of nuclear and compact-star matter, comparing the predictions from two kinds of phenomenological approaches: relativistic models (both with constant and density-dependent couplings) and non-relativistic Skyrme-type interactions. We mainly focus on the liquid-gas instabilities that occur at sub-saturation densities, leading to the decomposition of the homogeneous matter into a clusterized phase. Such study is related to the description of neutron-star crust (at zero temperature) and of supernova dynamics (at finite temperature). 
0808.00234	DMT of Multi-hop Cooperative Networks - Part I: Basic Results	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:K. Sreeram, S. Birenjith, P. Vijay Kumar	Abstract:  In this two-part paper, the DMT of cooperative multi-hop networks is examined. The focus is on single-source single-sink (ss-ss) multi-hop relay networks having slow-fading links and relays that potentially possess multiple antennas. The present paper examines the two end-points of the DMT of full-duplex networks. In particular, the maximum achievable diversity of arbitrary multi-terminal wireless networks is shown to be equal to the min-cut. The maximum multiplexing gain of arbitrary full-duplex ss-ss networks is shown to be equal to the min-cut rank, using a new connection to a deterministic network. We also prove some basic results including a proof that the colored noise encountered in AF protocols for cooperative networks can be treated as white noise for DMT computations. The DMT of a parallel channel with independent MIMO links is also computed here. As an application of these basic results, we prove that a linear tradeoff between maximum diversity and maximum multiplexing gain is achievable for full-duplex networks with single antenna nodes. All protocols in this paper are explicit and rely only upon amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying. Half duplex networks are studied, and explicit codes for all protocols proposed in both parts, are provided in the companion paper. 
0808.00235	DMT of Multi-hop Cooperative Networks - Part II: Half-Duplex Networks with Full-Duplex Performance	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:K. Sreeram, S. Birenjith, P. Vijay Kumar	Abstract:  We consider single-source single-sink (ss-ss) multi-hop relay networks, with slow-fading links and single-antenna half-duplex relay nodes. In a companion paper, we established some basic results which laid the foundation for the results presented here. In the present paper, we consider two families of networks of half-duplex networks. KPP networks may be viewed as the union of K node-disjoint parallel relaying paths. Generalizations of these networks include KPP(I) networks, which permit interference between paths and KPP(D) networks, which possess a direct link between source and sink. We characterize the DMT of these families of networks completely and show that they can achieve the cut-set bound, thus proving that full-duplex performance can be obtained even in the presence of the half-duplex constraint. We then consider layered networks, and prove that a linear DMT between maximum diversity and maximum multiplexing gain is achievable. All protocols in this paper are explicit and use only amplify-and-forward relaying. We also construct codes that achieve the optimal DMT for all the proposed schemes. Two key implications of the results in the paper are that the half-duplex constraint does not entail any rate loss for a large class of cooperative networks and that AF protocols are often optimal. 
0808.00236	Comparison of Two Interpretations of Josephson Effect	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:I. M. Yurin	Abstract:  This paper puts forward an interpretation of the Josephson effect based on the Alternative Theory of Superconductivity (ATS). A comparison of ATS- and BCS-based interpretations is provided. It is demonstrated that the ATS-based interpretation, unlike that based on BCS theory, does not require a revision of fundamentals of quantum physics. 
0808.00237	A Simple Solution of the Arrival Time Problem	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:P. Hraskó	Abstract:  Based on the principle that arrival time and position are simultaneously measurable quantities a simple formula is derived for the arrival time probability density in nonrelativistic quantum theory. 
0808.00238	Experimental investigation of the origin of the cross-over temperature in the cuprates	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Yuval Lubashevsky, Amit Keren	Abstract:  We investigate the cross-over temperature T* as a function of doping in (Ca_{x}La_{1-x})(Ba_{1.75-x}La_{0.25+x})Cu_3O_{y}, where the maximum Tc (Tc^max) varies continuously by 30% between families (x) with minimal structural changes. T* is determined by DC-susceptibility measurements. We find that T* scales with the maximum Neel temperature TN^max of each family. This result strongly supports a magnetic origin of T*, and indicates that three dimensional interactions play a role in its magnitude. 
0808.00239	To theory of gravitational interaction	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:A. V. Minkevich	Abstract:  Some principal problems of general relativity theory and attempts of their solution are discussed. The Poincare gauge theory of gravity as natural generalization of Einsteinian gravitation theory is considered. The changes of gravitational interaction in the frame of this theory leading to the solution of principal problems of general relativity theory are analyzed. 
0808.00240	Applying Bayesian Neural Networks to Separate Neutrino Events from Backgrounds in Reactor Neutrino Experiments	Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)	Authors:Ye Xu, Yixiong Meng, Weiwei Xu	Abstract:  A toy detector has been designed to simulate central detectors in reactor neutrino experiments in the paper. The samples of neutrino events and three major backgrounds from the Monte-Carlo simulation of the toy detector are generated in the signal region. The Bayesian Neural Networks(BNN) are applied to separate neutrino events from backgrounds in reactor neutrino experiments. As a result, the most neutrino events and uncorrelated background events in the signal region can be identified with BNN, and the part events each of the fast neutron and $^{8}$He/$^{9}$Li backgrounds in the signal region can be identified with BNN. Then, the signal to noise ratio in the signal region is enhanced with BNN. The neutrino discrimination increases with the increase of the neutrino rate in the training sample. However, the background discriminations decrease with the decrease of the background rate in the training sample. 
0808.00241	Ruppeiner Geometry of Anyon Gas	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Behrouz Mirza, Hosein Mohammadzadeh	Abstract:  We derive the thermodynamic curvature of a two dimensional ideal anyon gas of particles obeying fractional statistics. The statistical interactions of anyon gas can be attractive or repulsive. For attractive statistical interactions, thermodynamic curvature is positive and for repulsive statistical interactions, it is negative, which indicates a more stable anyon gas. There is a special case between the two where the thermodynamic curvature is zero. Small deviations from the classical limit will also be explored. 
0808.00242	Geometric Phase and Quantum Phase Transition : Two-Band Model	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:H.T.Cui, Jie Yi	Abstract:  The connection between the geometric phase and quantum phase transition has been discussed extensively in the two-band model. By introducing the twist operator, the geometric phase can be defined by calculating its ground-state expectation value. In contrast to the previous numerical examinations, our discussion presents an exact calculation for the determination of the geometric phase. Through two representative examples, our calculation shows the intimate connection between the geometric phase and phase transition: different behaviors of the geometric phase can be identified in this paper, which are directly related to the energy gap above the ground state. 
0808.00243	A variant of Tao's method with application to restricted sumsets	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Song Guo, Zhi-Wei Sun	Abstract:  In this paper, we develop Terence Tao's harmonic analysis method and apply it to restricted sumsets. The well known Cauchy-Davenport theorem asserts that if $A$ and $B$ are nonempty subsets of $Z/pZ$ with $p$ a prime, then $|A+B|\ge min{p,|A|+|B|-1}$, where $A+B={a+b: a\in A, b\in B}$. In 2005, Terence Tao gave a harmonic analysis proof of the Cauchy-Davenport theorem, by applying a new form of the uncertainty principle on Fourier transform. We modify Tao's method so that it can be used to prove the following extension of the Erdos-Heilbronn conjecture: If $A,B,S$ are nonempty subsets of $Z/pZ$ with $p$ a prime, then $|{a+b: a\in A, b\in B, a-b not\in S}|\ge min {p,|A|+|B|-2|S|-1}$. 
0808.00244	Radio spectrum of the AXP J1810-197 and of its profile components	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:K. Lazaridis, A. Jessner, M. Kramer, B. W. Stappers, A. G. Lyne, C. A. Jordan, M. Serylak, J. A. Zensus	Abstract:  As part of a European Pulsar Network (EPN) multi-telescope observing campaign, we performed simultaneous multi-frequency observations at 1.4, 4.9 and 8.4 GHz during July 2006 and quasi-simultaneous multi-frequency observations from Decem- ber 2006 until July 2007 at 2.7, 4.9, 8.4, 14.6 and 32 GHz, in order to obtain flux density measurements and spectral features of the 5.5-sec radio-emitting magnetar AXP J1810-197. We monitored the spectral evolution of its pulse shape which consists of a main pulse (MP) and an interpulse (IP). We present the flux density spectrum of the average profile and of the separate pulse components of this first-known radio-emitting transient anomalous X-ray pulsar. We observe a decrease of the flux density by a factor of 10 within 8 months and follow the disappearance of one of the two main components. Although the spectrum is generally flat, we observe large fluctuations of the spectral index with time. For that reason we have made some measurements of modulation indices for individual pulses in order to also investigate the origin of these fluctuations. 
0808.00245	Hot accretion with outflow and thermal conduction	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Mohsen Shadmehri	Abstract:  We present self-similar solutions for advection -dominated accretion flows with thermal conduction in the presence of outflows. Possible effects of outflows on the accretion flow are parametrized and a saturated form of thermal conduction, as is appropriate for the weakly-collisional regime of interest, is included in our model. While the cooling effect of outflows is noticeable, thermal conduction provides an extra heating source. In comparison to accretion flows without winds, we show that the disc rotates faster and becomes cooler because of the angular momentum and energy flux which are taking away by the winds. But thermal conduction opposes the effects of winds and not only decreases the rotational velocity, but increases the temperature. However, reduction of the surface density and the enhanced accretion velocity are amplified by both of the winds and the thermal conduction. We find that for stronger outflows, a higher level of saturated thermal conduction is needed to significantly modify the physical profiles of the accretion flow. 
0808.00246	Categorified Symplectic Geometry and the Classical String	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:John C. Baez, Alexander E. Hoffnung, Christopher L. Rogers	Abstract:  A Lie 2-algebra is a "categorified" version of a Lie algebra: that is, a category equipped with structures analogous those of a Lie algebra, for which the usual laws hold up to isomorphism. In the classical mechanics of point particles, the phase space is often a symplectic manifold, and the Poisson bracket of functions on this space gives a Lie algebra of observables. Multisymplectic geometry describes an n-dimensional field theory using a phase space that is an "n-plectic manifold": a finite-dimensional manifold equipped with a closed nondegenerate (n+1)-form. Here we consider the case n = 2. For any 2-plectic manifold, we construct a Lie 2-algebra of observables. We then explain how this Lie 2-algebra can be used to describe the dynamics of a classical bosonic string. Just as the presence of an electromagnetic field affects the symplectic structure for a charged point particle, the presence of a B field affects the 2-plectic structure for the string. 
0808.00247	A Public Key Block Cipher Based on Multivariate Quadratic Quasigroups	Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)	Authors:Danilo Gligoroski, Smile Markovski, Svein Johan Knapskog	Abstract:  We have designed a new class of public key algorithms based on quasigroup string transformations using a specific class of quasigroups called multivariate quadratic quasigroups (MQQ). Our public key algorithm is a bijective mapping, it does not perform message expansions and can be used both for encryption and signatures. The public key consist of n quadratic polynomials with n variables where n=140, 160, ... . A particular characteristic of our public key algorithm is that it is very fast and highly parallelizable. More concretely, it has the speed of a typical modern symmetric block cipher - the reason for the phrase "A Public Key Block Cipher" in the title of this paper. Namely the reference C code for the 160-bit variant of the algorithm performs decryption in less than 11,000 cycles (on Intel Core 2 Duo -- using only one processor core), and around 6,000 cycles using two CPU cores and OpenMP 2.0 library. However, implemented in Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA that is running on 249.4 MHz it achieves decryption throughput of 399 Mbps, and implemented on four Xilinx Virtex-5 chips that are running on 276.7 MHz it achieves encryption throughput of 44.27 Gbps. Compared to fastest RSA implementations on similar FPGA platforms, MQQ algorithm is more than 10,000 times faster. 
0808.00248	Motivic double shuffle	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Ismaël Soudères (IMJ)    	Abstract:  The goal of this article is to give an elementary proof of the double shuffle relations directly for the Goncharov and Manin motivic multiple zeta values. The shuffle relation is straightforward, but for the stuffle we use a modification of a method first introduced by P. Cartier for the purpose of proving stuffle for the real multiple zeta values via integrals and blow-up sequences. 
0808.00249	Reconstruction of Quantum Mechanics with Information Operators	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Ken'ichi Takano	Abstract:  We reconstruct quantum mechanics by introducing "information operators" and excluding the concept of wave functions. Multiple information operators simultaneously describe a single system and continuously develop in time even in the process of a measurement. We also introduce the concept of condensation for a system with many degrees of freedom in a rather general meaning. In terms of the multiplicity of description and the condensation, we explain quantum phenomena including measurements without the collapse of the wave function. 
0808.00250	Contraction in $L^1$ and large time behavior for a system arising in chemical reactions and molecular motors	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:M. Chipot, D. Hilhorst, D. Kinderlehrer, M. Olech	Abstract:  We prove a contraction in $L^1$ property for the solutions of a nonlinear reaction--diffusion system whose special cases include intercellular transport as well as reversible chemical reactions. Assuming the existence of stationary solutions we show that the solutions stabilize as $t$ tends to infinity. Moreover, in the special case of linear reaction terms, we prove the existence and the uniqueness (up to a multiplicative constant) of the stationary solution. 
0808.00251	Numerical approximation of a reaction-diffusion system with fast reversible reaction	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:R. Eymard, D. Hilhorst, M. Olech	Abstract:  We consider the finite volume approximation of a reaction-diffusion system with fast reversible reaction. We deduce from a priori estimates that the approximate solution converges to the weak solution of the reaction-diffusion problem and satisfies estimates which do not depend on the chemical kinetics factor. It follows that the solution converges to the solution of a nonlinear diffusion problem, as the size of the volume elements and the time steps converge to zero while the kinetic rate tends to infinity. 
0808.00252	Classifications of Cohen-Macaulay modules - The base ring associated to a transversal polymatroid	Commutative Algebra (math.AC)	Authors:Alin Ştefan	Abstract:  In this thesis, we focus on the study of the base rings associated to some transversal polymatroids. A transversal polymatroid is a special kind of discrete polymatroid. Discrete polymatroids were introduced by Herzog and Hibi \cite{HH} in 2002. 
0808.00253	Maps, sheaves, and K3 surfaces	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:R. Pandharipande	Abstract:  The conjectural equivalence of curve counting on Calabi-Yau 3-folds via stable maps and stable pairs is discussed. By considering Calabi-Yau 3-folds with K3 fibrations, the correspondence naturally connects curve and sheaf counting on K3 surfaces. New results and conjectures (with D. Maulik) about descendent integration on K3 surfaces are announced. The recent proof of the Yau-Zaslow conjecture is surveyed. The paper accompanies my lecture at the Clay research conference in Cambridge, MA in May 2008. 
0808.00254	The Current Understanding on the UV Upturn	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Sukyoung K. Yi	Abstract:  The unexpected high bump in the UV part of the spectrum found in nearby giant elliptical galaxies, a.k.a. the UV upturn, has been a subject of debate. A remarkable progress has been made lately from the observational side, mainly involving space telescopes. The GALEX UV telescope has been obtaining thousands of giant ellipticals in the nearby universe, while HST is resolving local galaxies into stars and star clusters. An important clue has also been found regarding the origin of hot HB stars, and perhaps of sdB stars. That is, extreme amounts of helium are suspected to be the origin of the extended HB and even to the UV upturn phenomenon. A flurry of studies are pursuing the physics behind it. All this makes me optimistic that the origin of the UV upturn will be revealed in the next few years. I review some of the most notable progress and remaining issues. 
0808.00255	WIMP dark matter, Higgs exchange and DAMA	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Sarah Andreas, Thomas Hambye, Michel H.G. Tytgat	Abstract:  In the WIMP scenario, there is a one-to-one relation between the dark matter (DM) relic density and spin independent direct detection rate if both the annihilation of DM and its elastic scattering on nuclei go dominantly through Higgs exchange. In particular, for DM masses much smaller than the Higgs boson mass, the ratio of the relevant cross sections depends only on the DM mass. Assuming DM mass and direct detection rate within the ranges allowed by the recent DAMA collaboration results -taking account of the channelling effect on energy threshold and the null results of the other direct detection experiments- gives a definite range for the relic density. For scalar DM models, like the Higgs portal models or the inert doublet model, the relic density range turns out to be in agreement with WMAP. This scenario implies that the Higgs boson has a large branching ratio to pairs of DM particles, a prediction which might challenge its search at the LHC. 
0808.00256	Constraining the cosmological constant and the DGP gravity with the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Lorenzo Iorio	Abstract:  We consider the double pulsar binary system as a laboratory to locally test the orbital effects induced by an uniform cosmological constant $Λ$ in the framework of the known general relativistic laws of gravity, and the DGP braneworld model of gravity independently of the cosmological acceleration itself for which they were introduced. We, first, construct the ratio R=Delta\dotω/Delta P of the discrepancies between the phenomenologically determined periastron rate \dotωand orbital period and their predicted values from the 1PN approximation and the third Kepler law. Then, we compare its value R = (0.3 +/- 4) \times 10^-11 s^-2, compatible with zero within the errors, to the ratios R_Lambda and R_DGP of the effects induced on the apsidal rate and the orbital period by Lambda and the DGP gravity; we find them neatly incompatible with R being R_Lambda = (3.4 +/- 0.3) \times 10^-8 s^-2 and R_DGP = (1.4 +/- 0.1) \times 10^-7 s^-2, respectively. Such a result, which for the case of Lambda is valid also for any other Hooke-like exotic force proportional to r, is in agreement with other negative local tests recently performed in the Solar System with the ratios of the non-Newtonian/Einsteinian perihelion precessions for several pairs of planets. 
0808.00257	The f-invariant and index theory	Algebraic Topology (math.AT)	Authors:Ulrich Bunke, Niko Naumann	Abstract:  In this paper we prove a tertiary index theorem which relates a spectral geometric and a homotopy theoretic invariant of an almost complex manifold with framed boundary. It is derived from the index theoretic and homotopy theoretic versions of a complex elliptic genus and interestingly related with the structure of the stable homotopy groups of spheres. 
0808.00258	Maximal operators on variable Lebesgue spaces with weights related to oscillations of Carleson curves	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Alexei Yu. Karlovich	Abstract:  We prove sufficient conditions for the boundedness of the maximal operator on variable Lebesgue spaces with weights $\varphi_{t,γ}(τ)=|(τ-t)^γ|$, where $γ$ is a complex number, over arbitrary Carleson curves. If the curve has different spirality indices at the point $t$ and $γ$ is not real, then $\varphi_{t,γ}$ is an oscillating weight lying beyond the class of radial oscillating weights considered recently by V. Kokilashvili, N. Samko, and S. Samko. 
0808.00259	Disorder-Induced Phase Control in Superfluid Fermi-Bose Mixtures	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:Armand Niederberger, Jan Wehr, Maciej Lewenstein, Krzysztof Sacha	Abstract:  We consider a mixture of a superfluid Fermi gas of ultracold atoms and a Bose-Einstein condensate of molecules possessing a continuous U(1) (relative phase) symmetry. We study the effects that a spatially random photo-associative-dissociative symmetry breaking coupling of the systems. Such coupling allows to control the relative phase between a superfluid order parameter of the Fermi system and the condensate wavefunction of molecules for temperatures below the BCS critical temperature. The presented mechanism of phase control belongs to the general class of disorder-induced order phenomena that rely on breaking of continuous symmetry. 
0808.00260	Absorption Properties and Evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:G. Hasinger (1 and 2) ((1) MPE Garching, (2) IfA Hawaii)    	Abstract:  Intrinsic absorption is a fundamental physical property to understand the evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Here a sample of 1290 AGN, selected in the 2-10 keV band from different flux-limited surveys with very high optical identification completeness is studied. The AGN are grouped into two classes, unabsorbed (type-1) and absorbed (type-2), depending on their optical spectroscopic classification and X-ray absorption properties, using hardness ratios. Utilizing the optical to X-ray flux ratios, a rough correction for the ~8% redshift incompleteness still present in the sample is applied. A strong decrease of the absorbed fraction with X-ray luminosity is found. This can be represented by an almost linear decrease from ~80% to ~20% in the luminosity range log L_X=42-46 and is consistent with similar derivations in the optical and MIR bands. A significant increase of the absorbed fraction with redshift is found, which can be described by a power law with a slope ~(1+z)^{0.62+/-0.11}, saturating at a redshift of z~2. A simple power law fit ~(1+z)^{0.48+/-0.08} over the whole redshift is also marginally consistent with the data. The variation of the AGN absorption with luminosity and redshift is described with higher statistical accuracy and smaller systematic errors than previous results. The findings have important consequences for the broader context of AGN and galaxy co-evolution. Here it is proposed that the cosmic downsizing in the AGN population is due to two different feeding mechanisms: a fast process of merger driven accretion at high luminosities and high redshifts versus a slow process of gas accretion from gravitational instabilities in galactic disks rebuilding around pre-formed bulges and black holes. 
0808.00261	On the consistency of warm inflation	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ian G Moss, Chun Xiong	Abstract:  Conditions are obtained for the existence of a warm inflationary attractor in the system of equations describing an inflaton coupled to radiation. These conditions restrict the temperature dependence of the dissipative terms and the size of thermal corrections to the inflaton potential, as well as the gradient of the inflaton potential. When these conditions are met, the evolution approaches a slow-roll limit and only curvature fluctuations survive on super-horizon scales. Formulae are given for the spectral indices of the density perturbations and the tensor/scalar density perturbation amplitude ratio in warm inflation. 
0808.00262	Complexifications of Morse functions and the directed Donaldson-Fukaya category	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Joe Johns	Abstract:  Let N be a closed four dimensional manifold which admits a self-indexing Morse function f with only 3 critical values 0,2,4, and a unique maximum and minimum. Let g be a Riemannian metric on N such that (f,g) is Morse-Smale. We construct from (N,f,g) a certain six dimensional exact symplectic manifold M, together with some exact Lagrangian spheres V_4, V_2^j, V_0 in M, j=1,...,k. These spheres correspond to the critical points x_4, x_2^j, x_0 of f, where the subscript indicates the Morse index. (In a companion paper we explain how (M, V_4,{V_2^j},V_0) is a model for the regular fiber and vanishing spheres of the complexification of f, viewed as a Lefschetz fibration on the disk cotangent bundle D(T^*N).) Our main result is a computation of the Lagrangian Floer homology groups HF(V_4,V_2^j), HF(V_2^j,V_0), HF(V_4,V_0) and the triangle product mu_2: HF(V_4,V_2^j) \otimes HF(V_2^j,V_0) --> HF(V_4,V_0). The outcome is that the directed Donaldson-Fukaya category of (M,V_4,{V_2^j},V_0) is isomorphic to the flow category of (N,f,g). 
0808.00263	Gain-assisted superluminal light propagation via incoherent pump field	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:M. Mahmoudi, S. Worya Rabiei, L. Safari, M. Sahrai	Abstract:  We investigate the dispersion and the absorption properties of a weak probe field in a three-level Lambda-type atomic system. We use just an incoherent field for controlling the group velocity of light. It is shown that the slope of dispersion changes from positive to negative just with changing the intensity of the indirect incoherent pumping field. Gain-assisted superluminal light propagation appears in this system. No laser field is used in the pumping processes. 
0808.00264	Shape coexistence near the neutron number N=20: First identification of the E0 decay from the deformed 0^+_2 state in 30Mg	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:W. Schwerdtfeger, P.G. Thirolf, K. Wimmer, D. Habs, H. Mach, T.R. Rodriguez, V. Bildstein, J.L. Egido, L.M. Fraile, R. Gernhaeuser, R. Hertenberger, K. Heyde, P. Hoff, H. Huebel, U. Koester, T. Kroell, R. Kruecken, R. Lutter, T. Morgan, P. Ring	Abstract:  The 1789 keV level in 30Mg was identified as the first excited 0^+ state by measuring its E0 transition to the ground state. The measured small value of rho^2(E0,0^+_2 --> 0^+_1) = 5.7(14) x 10^-3 implies a very small mixing of competing configurations with largely different intrinsic quadrupole deformation near N=20. Axially symmetric Beyond-Mean-Field configuration mixing calculations identify the ground state of 30Mg to be based on neutron configurations below the N=20 shell closure, while the excited 0^+ state mainly consists of a two neutrons excitated into the nu1 f_{7/2} orbital. Using a two-level model, a mixing amplitude of 0.08(4) can be derived. 
0808.00265	General solutions to equation $axb^*-bx^*a^*=c$ in rings with involution	Rings and Algebras (math.RA)	Authors:Chao You, Changhui Wang, Yicheng Jiang	Abstract:  In [Q. Xu et al., The solutions to some operator equations, Linear Algebra Appl.(2008), doi:10.1016/j.laa.2008.05.034], Xu et al. provided the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution to the equation $AXB^*-BX^*A^*=C$ in the general setting of the adjointable operators between Hilbert $C^*$-modules. Based on the generalized inverses, they also obtained the general expression of the solution in the solvable case. In this paper, we generalize their work in the more general setting of ring $R$ with involution * and reobtain results for rectangular matrices and operators between Hilbert $C^*$-modules by embedding the "rectangles" into rings of square matrices or rings of operators acting on the same space. 
0808.00266	Nonlinear energy harvesting	Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO)	Authors:F. Cottone, L. Gammaitoni, H. Vocca	Abstract:  Ambient energy harvesting has been in recent years the recurring object of a number of research efforts aimed at providing an autonomous solution to the powering of small-scale electronic mobile devices. Among the different solutions, vibration energy harvesting has played a major role due to the almost universal presence of mechanical vibrations: from ground shaking to human movements, from ambient sound to thermal noise. Standard approaches are mainly based on resonant linear oscillators that are acted on by ambient vibrations. Here we propose a new method based on the exploitation of the dynamical features of stochastic nonlinear oscillators. Such a method is shown to outperform standard linear oscillators and to overcome some of the most severe limitations of present approaches, like narrow bandwidth, need for continuous frequency tuning and low efficiency. We demonstrate the superior performances of this method by applying it to piezoelectric energy harvesting from ambient vibration. Experimental results from a toy-model oscillator are described in terms of nonlinear stochastic dynamics. We prove that the method proposed here is quite general in principle and could be applied to a wide class of nonlinear oscillators and different energy conversion principles. There are also potentials for realizing micro/nano-scale power generators. 
0808.00267	GRIPS - Gamma-Ray Burst Investigation via Polarimetry and Spectroscopy	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. Greiner, et al    	Abstract:  The primary scientific goal of the GRIPS mission is to revolutionize our understanding of the early universe using gamma-ray bursts. We propose a new generation gamma-ray observatory capable of unprecedented spectroscopy over a wide range of gamma-ray energies (200 keV--50 MeV) and of polarimetry (200--1000 keV). Secondary goals achievable by this mission include direct measurements of supernova interiors through gamma-rays from radioactive decays, nuclear astrophysics with massive stars and novae, and studies of particle acceleration near compact stars, interstellar shocks, and clusters of galaxies. 
0808.00268	Simulations of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect from Quasars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Suchetana Chatterjee (University of Pittsburgh), Tiziana Di Matteo (McWilliam's Center for Cosmology, Carnegie Mellon University), Arthur Kosowsky (University of Pittsburgh), Inti Pelupessy (McWilliam's Center for Cosmology, Carnegie Mellon University)    	Abstract:  Quasar feedback has most likely a substantial but only partially understood impact on the formation of structure in the universe. A potential direct probe of this feedback mechanism is the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect: energy emitted from quasar heats the surrounding intergalactic medium and induce a distortion in the microwave background radiation passing through the region. Here we examine the formation of such hot quasar bubbles using a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation which includes a self-consistent treatment of black hole growth and associated feedback, along with radiative gas cooling and star formation. From this simulation, we construct microwave maps of the resulting Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect around black holes with a range of masses and redshifts. The size of the temperature distortion scales approximately with black hole mass and accretion rate, with a typical amplitude up to a few micro-Kelvin on angular scales around 10 arcseconds. We discuss prospects for the direct detection of this signal with current and future single-dish and interferometric observations, including ALMA and CCAT. These measurements will be challenging, but will allow us to characterize the evolution and growth of supermassive black holes and the role of their energy feedback on galaxy formation.

Abazov, et al    	Abstract:  We describe a search for Z boson pair production in pp collisions at sqrt(s)= 1.96 TeV with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.7 fb^-1. Using the final state decay ZZ to llvv (where l = e or mu) we measure a signal with a 2.6 standard deviations significance (2.0 expected) and measure a cross section of sigma(pp to ZZ + X) = 2.01 +- 0.93 (stat.) +- 0.29 (sys.) pb. 
0808.00270	VOSA: Virtual Observatory SED Analyzer. An application to the Collinder 69 open cluster	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Bayo, C. Rodrigo, D. Barrado y Navascues, E. Solano, R. Gutierrez, M. Morales--Calderon, F. Allard	Abstract:  The physical properties of almost any kind of astronomical object can be derived by fitting synthetic spectra or photometry extracted from theoretical models to observational data. We want to develop an automatic procedure to perform this kind of fittings to a relatively large sample of members of a stellar association and apply this methodology to the case of Collinder 69. We combine the multiwavelength data of our sources and follow a work-flow to derive the physical parameters of the sources. The key step of the work-flow is performed by a new VO-tool, VOSA. All the steps in this process are done in a VO environment. We present this new tool, and provide physical parameters such as T$_{\rm eff}$, gravity, luminosity, etc. for $\sim$170 candidate members to Collinder 69, and an upper-limit for the age of this stellar association. This kind of studies of star forming regions, clusters, etc. produces a huge amount of data, very tedious to analyse using the traditional methodology. Thus, they are excellent examples where to apply the VO capabilities. 
0808.00271	Measurements of the Top Quark mass at CDF	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:N. van Remortel (the CDF Collaboration)    	Abstract:  We review the most recent measurements of the top quark mass using data collected by the CDF experiment at the Tevatron 1.96 TeV ppbar collider. The mass measurements are performed in all main decay modes of the produced ttbar pairs using integrated luminosities up to 2fb-1. In most channels the total uncertainty is dominated by systematic effects, most of which are currently being revised. The precise measurement of the top quark mass is one of the Tevatron's main and long lasting legacies. Besides serving as a benchmark measurement at the LHC collider, it will serve as a consistency check of the Standard Model in case a a neutral CP even Higgs boson is found, either at the Tevatron or at the LHC.

From the limit, we derive a full-rank overhead as a lower bound for stable overheads for successful maximum-likelihood decoding of the codes. 
0808.00273	Top Quark Mass and Cross Section Results from the Tevatron	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:F. Garberson (University of California Santa Barbara)    	Abstract:  This note details recent measurements of the top mass and cross section that have been performed at the Tevatron. Most of these measurements have been performed with between 1.0 and 2.0 fb-1 of data. Basic top physics concepts are discussed, cross section and mass analysis methods and results are presented, and future analysis prospects are discussed with a special attention given to Electroweak determination of the limits on the Standard Model Higgs mass. 
0808.00274	Generalized Fokker-Planck equation: Derivation and exact solutions	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:S. I. Denisov (1 and 2), Werner Horsthemke (3), Peter Hänggi (4) ((1) Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems, Germany, (2) Sumy State University, Ukraine, (3) Southern Methodist University, USA, (4) Augsburg University, Germany)    	Abstract:  We derive the generalized Fokker-Planck equation associated with the Langevin equation (in the Ito sense) for an overdamped particle in an external potential driven by multiplicative noise with an arbitrary distribution of the increments of the noise generating process. We explicitly consider this equation for various specific types of noises, including Poisson white noise and Lévy stable noise, and show that it reproduces all Fokker-Planck equations that are known for these noises. Exact analytical, time-dependent and stationary solutions of the generalized Fokker-Planck equation are derived and analyzed in detail for the cases of a linear, a quadratic, and a tailored potential. 
0808.00275	Trivial extensions defined by Prufer conditions	Commutative Algebra (math.AC)	Authors:C. Bakkari, S. Kabbaj, N. Mahdou	Abstract:  This paper deals with well-known extensions of the Prufer domain concept to arbitrary commutative rings. We investigate the transfer of these notions in trivial ring extensions (also called idealizations) of commutative rings by modules and then generate original families of rings with zerodivisors subject to various Prufer conditions. The new examples give further evidence for the validity of Bazzoni-Glaz conjecture on the weak dimension of Gaussian rings. Moreover, trivial ring extensions allow us to widen the scope of validity of Kaplansky-Tsang conjecture on the content ideal of Gaussian polynomials. 
0808.00276	Topology Properties of Written Human Language	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:B. R. Gadjiev, T. B. Progulova	Abstract:  We use the extended Barabasi model without the rewired process and show that the degree distribution for the corresponding networks is the Tsallis distribution. We offer an analysis of the novel "The Sound and the Fury" by W. Faulkner in English and in Russian, and show that the degree distributions of the relevant word networks are described with the Tsallis distribution. We have constructed degree distributions for each of the relevant word networks and defined the value of the nonextensivity parameter with the maximum likelihood method. For the novel text in English qB = 1.57; qK = 1.49; qJ = 1.53; qA = 1.47; qT = 1.54, and for the translation into Russian qB = 1.50; qK = 1.42; qD = 1.46; qA = 1.40; qT = 1.47. Therefore, if the translation of the novel is regarded as mapping, the nonextensivity parameters ordering qB > qT > qD > qK > qA is an invariant of this mapping. 
0808.00277	Typical elements in free groups are in different doubly-twisted conjugacy classes	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:P. Christopher Staecker	Abstract:  We give an easily checkable algebraic condition which implies that two elements of a finitely generated free group are members of distinct doubly-twisted conjugacy classes with respect to a pair of homomorphisms. We further show that this criterion is satisfied with probability 1 when the homomorphisms and elements are chosen at random. 
0808.00278	Basic properties of three-leg Heisenberg tube	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:S. Nishimoto, M. Arikawa	Abstract:  We study three-leg antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with the periodic boundary conditions in the rung direction. Since the rungs form regular triangles, spin frustration is induced. We use the density-matrix renormalization group method to investigate the ground state. We find that the spin excitations are always gapped to remove the spin frustration as long as the rung coupling is nonzero. We also visibly confirm spin-Peierls dimerization order in the leg direction. Both the spin gap and the dimerization order are basically enhanced as the rung coupling increases. 
0808.00279	A method to correct IACT data for atmospheric absorption due to the Saharan Air Layer	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Daniela Dorner, Kari Nilsson, Thomas Bretz	Abstract:  Using the atmosphere as a detector volume, Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) depend highly on the properties and the condition of the air mass above the telescope. On the Canary Island of La Palma, where the Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov telescope (MAGIC) is situated, the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) can cause strong atmospheric absorption affecting the data quality and resulting in a reduced gamma flux. To correlate IACT data with other measurements, e.g. long-term monitoring or Multi-Wavelength (MWL) studies, an accurate flux determination is mandatory. Therefore, a method to correct the data for the effect of the SAL is needed. Three different measurements of the atmospheric absorption are performed on La Palma. From the determined transmission, a correction factor is calculated and applied to the MAGIC data. The different transmission measurements from optical and IACT data provide comparable results. MAGIC data of PG 1553+113, taken during a MWL campaign in July 2006, have been analyzed using the presented method, providing a corrected flux measurement for the study of the spectral energy distribution of the source. 
0808.00280	Superradiant Instability of Five-Dimensional Rotating Charged AdS Black Holes	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Alikram N. Aliev, Özgür Delice	Abstract:  We study the instability of small AdS black holes with two independent rotation parameters in minimal five-dimensional gauged supergravity to massless scalar perturbations. We analytically solve the Klein-Gordon equation for low-frequency perturbations in two regions of the spacetime of these black holes: namely, in the region close to the horizon and in the far-region. By matching the solutions in an intermediate region, we calculate the frequency spectrum of quasinormal modes. We show that in the regime of superradiance only the modes of even orbital quantum number undergo negative damping, resulting in exponential growth of the amplitude. That is, the black holes become unstable to these modes. Meanwhile, the modes of odd orbital quantum number do not undergo any damping, oscillating with frequency-shifts. This is in contrast with the case of four-dimensional small Kerr-AdS black holes which exhibit the instability to all modes of scalar perturbations in the regime of superradiance. 
0808.00281	Multiferroicity in the spin-1/2 quantum matter of LiCu2O2	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:A. Rusydi, I. Mahns, S. Mueller, M. Ruebhausen, S. Park, Y.J. Choi, C. L. Zhang, S-W. Cheong, S. Smadici, P. Abbamonte, M. v. Zimmermann, G. A. Sawatzky	Abstract:  Multiferroicity in LiCu2O2 single crystals is studied using resonant soft x-ray magnetic scattering, hard x-ray diffraction, heat capacity, magnetic susceptibility, and electrical polarization. Two magnetic transitions are found at 24.6 K (T1) and 23.2 K (T2). Our data are consistent with a sinusoidal spin structure at T2<T<T1 and with a helicoidal spin structure at T<T2 giving rise to ferroelectricity. Surprisingly, above T2 the correlation lengths of the spin structures increase as the temperature increases with dramatic changes of ~42% along the c-axis. Our results demonstrate the interplay of the geometrical frustration and the electronic and magnetic polarizations. 
0808.00282	Aspects of quantum integrability for pure spinor superstring in AdS(5)xS(5)	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Valentina Giangreco M. Puletti	Abstract:  We consider the monodromy matrix for the pure spinor IIB superstring on $AdS_5\times S^5$ at leading order at strong coupling, in particular its variation under an infinitesimal and continuous deformation of the contour. Such variation is equivalent to the insertion of a local operator. Demanding the BRST-closure for such an operator rules out its existence, implying that the monodromy matrix remains contour-independent at the first order in perturbation theory. Furthermore we explicitly compute the field strength corresponding to the flat connections up to leading order and directly check that it is free from logarithmic divergences. The absence of anomaly in the coordinate transformation of the monodromy matrix and the UV-finiteness of the curvature tensor finally imply the integrability of the pure spinor superstring at the first order. 
0808.00283	Innocuous Implications of a Minimum Length in Quantum Gravity	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Paul H. Frampton	Abstract:  A modification to the time-energy uncertainty relation in quantum gravity has been interpreted as increasing the duration of fluctuations producing virtual black holes with masses greater than the Planck mass. I point out that such virtual black holes have an exponential factor arising from the action such that their contribution to proton decay is suppressed, rather than enhanced, relative to Planck-mass black holes. 
0808.00284	Uniqueness of certain polynomials constant on a line	Complex Variables (math.CV)	Authors:Jiri Lebl, Daniel Lichtblau	Abstract:  We study a question with connections to linear algebra, real algebraic geometry, combinatorics, and complex analysis. Let $p(x,y)$ be a polynomial of degree $d$ with $N$ positive coefficients and no negative coefficients, such that $p=1$ when $x+y=1$. A sharp estimate $d \leq 2N-3$ is known. In this paper we study the $p$ for which equality holds. We prove some new results about the form of these "sharp" polynomials. Using these new results and using two independent computational methods we give a complete classification of these polynomials up to $d=17$. The question is motivated by the problem of classification of CR maps between spheres in different dimensions.

We also list some channels for further studies.

Lissajous figures of current responding to a sinusoidal voltage are presented. 
0808.00287	Mathematical Models and Biological Meaning: Taking Trees Seriously	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:Jeremy L. Martin, E. O. Wiley	Abstract:  We compare three basic kinds of discrete mathematical models used to portray phylogenetic relationships among species and higher taxa: phylogenetic trees, Hennig trees and Nelson cladograms. All three models are trees, as that term is commonly used in mathematics; the difference between them lies in the biological interpretation of their vertices and edges. Phylogenetic trees and Hennig trees carry exactly the same information, and translation between these two kinds of trees can be accomplished by a simple algorithm. On the other hand, evolutionary concepts such as monophyly are represented as different mathematical substructures are represented differently in the two models. For each phylogenetic or Hennig tree, there is a Nelson cladogram carrying the same information, but the requirement that all taxa be represented by leaves necessarily makes the representation less efficient. Moreover, we claim that it is necessary to give some interpretation to the edges and internal vertices of a Nelson cladogram in order to make it useful as a biological model. One possibility is to interpret internal vertices as sets of characters and the edges as statements of inclusion; however, this interpretation carries little more than incomplete phenetic information. We assert that from the standpoint of phylogenetics, one is forced to regard each internal vertex of a Nelson cladogram as an actual (albeit unsampled) species simply to justify the use of synapomorphies rather than symplesiomorphies. 
0808.00288	Superconductivity in Yttrium Iron Oxyarsenide System	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:S V Chong, T Mochiji, K Kadowaki	Abstract:  Iron-based oxypnictides substituted with yttrium have been prepared via a conventional solid state reaction. The product after first 50 hours of reaction showed diamagnetic-like transition at around 10 K but was not superconducting, while additional 72 hours of high temperature heat treatment was required to yield superconducting sample which was doped with fluoride. Temperature dependence of the susceptibility shows both screening and Meissner effect at around 10 K, while resistance as a function of temperature displayed a drop at around the same temperature. 
0808.00289	Superconductivity and Magnetism in REFeAsO1-xFx (RE=Rare Earth Elements)	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:K Kadowaki, T Goya, T Mochiji, S V Chong	Abstract:  Fluoride-doped iron-based oxypnictides containing rare-earth gadolinium (GdFeAsO0.8F0.2) and co-doping with yttrium (Gd0.8Y0.2FeAsO0.8F0.2) have been prepared via conventional solid state reaction at ambient pressure. The non-yttrium substituted oxypnictide show superconducting transition as high as 43.9 K from temperature dependent resistance measurements with the Meissner effect observed at a lower temperature of 40.8 K from temperature dependent magnetization measurements. By replacing a small amount of gadolinium with yttrium Tc was observed to be lowered by 10 K which might be caused by a change in the electronic or magnetic structures since the crystal structure was not altered. 
0808.00290	De Broglie-Bohm Guidance Equations for Arbitrary Hamiltonians	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Ward Struyve, Antony Valentini	Abstract:  In a pilot-wave theory, an individual closed system is described by a wavefunction $ψ(q)$ and configuration $q$. The evolution of the wavefunction and configuration are respectively determined by the Schrödinger and guidance equations. The guidance equation states that the velocity field for the configuration is given by the quantum current divided by the density $|ψ(q)|^2$. We present the currents and associated guidance equations for any Hamiltonian given by a differential operator. These are derived directly from the Schrödinger equation, and also as Noether currents arising from a global phase symmetry associated with the wavefunction in configuration space. 
0808.00291	One shot schemes for decentralized quickest change detection	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Olympia Hadjiliadis, Hongzhong Zhang, H.V. Poor	Abstract:  This work considers the problem of quickest detection with N distributed sensors that receive continuous sequential observations from the environment. These sensors employ cumulative sum (CUSUM) strategies and communicate to a central fusion center by one shot schemes. One shot schemes are schemes in which the sensors communicate with the fusion center only once, after which they must signal a detection. The communication is clearly asynchronous and the case is considered in which the fusion center employs a minimal strategy, which means that it declares an alarm when the first communication takes place. It is assumed that the observations received at the sensors are independent and that the time points at which the appearance of a signal can take place are different. It is shown that there is no loss of performance of one shot schemes as compared to the centralized case in an extended Lorden min-max sense, since the minimum of N CUSUMs is asymptotically optimal as the mean time between false alarms increases without bound. 
0808.00292	Raman scattering in current carrying molecular junctions. A preliminary account	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Michael Galperin, Mark A. Ratner, Abraham Nitzan	Abstract:  This is a preliminary acount of a theory for Raman scattering by current-carrying molecular junctions. The approach combines a non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) description of the non-equilibrium junction with a generalized scattering theory formulation for evaluating the light scattering signal. This generalizes our previous study (Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 206802 (2005); J. Chem. Phys. 124, 234709 (2006)) of junction spectroscopy by including molecular vibrations and developing machinery for calculation of state-to-state (Raman scattering) fluxes within the NEGF formalism. For large enough voltage bias we find that the light scattering signal contains, in addition to the normal signal associated with the molecular ground electronic state, also a contribution from the inverse process originated from the excited molecular state as well as an interference component. The effect of coupling to the electrodes and of the imposed bias on the total Raman scattering as well as its components are discussed. Our result reduces to the standard expression for Raman scattering in the isolated molecule case, i.e. in the absence of coupling to the electrodes. The theory is used to discuss the charge transfer contribution to surface enhanced Raman scattering for molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces and its manifestation in the biased junction. 
0808.00293	A note on the non-commutative Laplace-Varadhan integral lemma	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:W. De Roeck, C. Maes, K. Netocny, L. Rey-Bellet	Abstract:  We continue the study of the free energy of quantum lattice spin systems where to the local Hamiltonian $H$ an arbitrary mean field term is added, a polynomial function of the arithmetic mean of some local observables $X$ and $Y$ that do not necessarily commute. By slightly extending a recent paper by Hiai, Mosonyi, Ohno and Petz [9], we prove in general that the free energy is given by a variational principle over the range of the operators $X$ and $Y$. As in [9], the result is a noncommutative extension of the Laplace-Varadhan asymptotic formula. 
0808.00294	The moduli of curves of genus 6 and K3 surfaces	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Michela Artebani, Shigeyuki Kondo	Abstract:  We prove that the coarse moduli space of curves of genus 6 is birational to an arithmetic quotient of a bounded symmetric domain of type IV by giving a period map to the moduli space of some lattice-polarized K3 surfaces. 
0808.00295	Renormalization of a modified gravity with a quadratic Riemann tensor term	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:M. Chaves	Abstract:  We consider a modified form of gravity, which has an extra term quadratic in the Riemann tensor. This term mimics a Yang-Mills theory. The other defining characteristic of this gravity is having the affine connection independent of the metric. (The metricity of the metric is rejected, too, since it implies a Levi-Civita connection.) It is then shown that, in the low density limit, this modified gravity does not differ from the General Theory of Relativity. We then point out that its Lagrangian does not contain partials of the metric, so that the metric is not a quantum field, nor does it contribute propagators to the Feynman diagrams of the theory. We also point out that the couplings of this theory (that determine the topological structure of the Feynman diagrams) all come from the term quadratic in the Riemann tensor. As a result of this situation, the diagrams of this theory and the diagrams of a Yang-Mills theory all have the same topology and degree of divergence, up to numerical coefficients. Since Yang-Mills theories are renormalizable, it follows that this theory should also be renormalizable. 
0808.00296	Magnetic and Transport Studies on Electron-doped CeFeAsO1-xFx Superconductor	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:S.V. Chong, T. Mochiji, S. Sato, K. Kadowaki	Abstract:  The magnetic and transport behaviors of cerium substituted iron oxy-arsenide superconductor with x = 0.1 to 0.4 fluoride (F) doping have been investigated in this report. Temperature dependent susceptibility and resistivity measurements showed the 0.1 F-doped sample (CeFeAsO0.9F0.1) has a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of around 30 K. With increasing doping beyond x = 0.2 Tc saturates to around 40 K. Temperature dependent susceptibility measured in different magnetic fields for the under-doped sample showed Meissner effect in low field and the diamagnetism is still visible up to 1 Tesla, with an obvious magnetic transition below 5 K, perhaps originating from magnetic ordering of the rare earth cerium. The corresponding field dependent resistance versus temperature measurements indicated a broadening of less than 3 K for Tc at mid-point by increasing the field to 5 Tesla indicating rather low anisotropy. An estimated upper critical field of more than 48 Tesla and accordingly an estimated maximum coherence length of 2.6 nm were obtained confirming the high upper critical field with a short coherence length for this superconductor. 
0808.00297	Ellipses Inscribed in Parallelograms	Metric Geometry (math.MG)	Authors:Alan Horwitz	Abstract:  We prove that there exists a unique ellipse of minimal eccentricity, E_{I}, inscribed in a parallelogram, D. We also prove that the smallest nonnegative angle between equal conjugate diameters of E_{I} equals the smallest nonnegative angle between the diagonals of D. We also prove that if E_{M} is the unique ellipse inscribed in a rectangle, R, which is tangent at the midpoints of the sides of R, then E_{M} is the unique ellipse of minimal eccentricity, maximal area, and maximal arc length inscribed in R. Let D be any convex quadrilateral. In previous papers, the author proved that there is a unique ellipse of minimal eccentricity, E_{I}, inscribed in D, and a unique ellipse, E_{O}, of minimal eccentricity circumscribed about D. We defined D to be bielliptic if E_{I} and E_{O} have the same eccentricity. In this paper we show that a parallelogram, D, is bielliptic if and only if the square of the length of one of the diagonals of D equals twice the square of the length of one of the sides of D. 
0808.00298	Computing the nucleolus of weighted voting games	Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)	Authors:Edith Elkind, Dmitrii V. Pasechnik	Abstract:  Weighted voting games (WVG) are coalitional games in which an agent's contribution to a coalition is given by his it weight, and a coalition wins if its total weight meets or exceeds a given quota. These games model decision-making in political bodies as well as collaboration and surplus division in multiagent domains. The computational complexity of various solution concepts for weighted voting games received a lot of attention in recent years. In particular, Elkind et al.(2007) studied the complexity of stability-related solution concepts in WVGs, namely, of the core, the least core, and the nucleolus. While they have completely characterized the algorithmic complexity of the core and the least core, for the nucleolus they have only provided an NP-hardness result. In this paper, we solve an open problem posed by Elkind et al. by showing that the nucleolus of WVGs, and, more generally, k-vector weighted voting games with fixed k, can be computed in pseudopolynomial time, i.e., there exists an algorithm that correctly computes the nucleolus and runs in time polynomial in the number of players and the maximum weight. In doing so, we propose a general framework for computing the nucleolus, which may be applicable to a wider of class of games. 
0808.00299	Direct coupling between magnetism and superconducting current in Josephson Phi junction	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:A. Buzdin	Abstract:  We study the proximity effect between conventional superconductor and magnetic normal metal with a spin-orbit interaction of the Rashba type. Using the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory and the quasiclassical Eilenberger approach it is demonstrated that the Josephson junction with such a metal as a weak link has a special non-sinusoidal current-phase relation. The ground state of this junction is caracterized by the finite phase difference Phi, which is proportional to the strength of the spin-orbit interaction and the exchange field in the normal metal. The proposed mechanism of the Phi junction formation gives a direct coupling between the superconducting current and the magnetic moment in the weak link. Therefore the Phi junctions open interesting perspectives for the superconducting spintronics. 
0808.00300	Matrix Filters for the Detection of Extragalactic Point Sources in Cosmic Microwave Background Images	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:D. Herranz, J.L. Sanz	Abstract:  In this paper we introduce a new linear filtering technique, the so-called matrix filters, that maximizes the signal-to-interference ratio of compact sources of unknown intensity embedded in a set of images by taking into account the cross-correlations between the different channels. By construction, the new filtering technique outperforms (or at least equals) the standard matched filter applied on individual images. An immediate application is the detection of extragalactic point sources in Cosmic Microwave Background images obtained at different wavelengths. We test the new technique in two simulated cases: a simple two-channel case with ideal correlated color noise and more realistic simulations of the sky as it will be observed by the LFI instrument of the upcoming ESA's Planck mission. In both cases we observe an improvement with respect to the standard matched filter in terms of signal-to-noise interference, number of detections and number of false alarms. 
0808.00301	C*-algebras associated to shift spaces	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Toke Meier Carlsen	Abstract:  These are some notes I wrote for the summer school "Symbolic dynamics and homeomorphisms of the Cantor set" at the University of Copenhagen, 23 - 27 June 2008. The notes contain the definition of the C*-algebra associated to a shift space and some basic facts about these. The notes furthermore contain a proof of the fact that the C*-algebra associated to a shift space is a one-sided conjugacy invariant, and a proof of the fact that the Morita equivalence class of the C*-algebra associated to a shift space is a two-sided conjugacy and a flow invariant. The notes also contain a section (without proofs) about the K-theory of C*-algebras associated to shift spaces. The notes are written for people without a background in operator algebra and contains a short appendix about C*-algebras, Morita equivalence and K-theory of C*-algebras. 
0808.00302	Resonant impurity scattering in the $\pm$s-gap state of the Fe-based superconductors	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Yunkyu Bang, Han-Yong Choi	Abstract:  We study the impurity scattering on the $\pm$s-wave superconductor, with realistic parameters for the Fe-pnictide superconductors. Using $\mathcal{T}$-matrix method, generalized for the two bands, we found that impurity scattering of the unitary limit forms off-centered bound states inside of the superconducting gap, which modifies, surprisingly, the density of states (DOS) of a fully opened gap to a V-shaped one as in the case of a d-wave superconductor. This behavior provides coherent explanations to the several conflicting experimental issues of the Fe-pnictide superconductors: the V-shaped DOS but with an isotropic gap observed in the photoemission and tunneling experiments; the power law behavior of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1 \approx T^α$ ; $α\approx 3$), down to very low temperatures. 
0808.00303	Perelman's reduced volume and a gap theorem for the Ricci flow	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Takumi Yokota	Abstract:  In this paper, we show that any ancient solution to the Ricci flow with the reduced volume whose asymptotic limit is sufficiently close to that of the Gaussian soliton is isometric to the Euclidean space for all time. This is a generalization of Anderson's result for Ricci-flat manifolds. As a corollary, a gap theorem for gradient shrinking Ricci solitons is also obtained. 
0808.00304	Glueball correlators as holograms	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Hilmar Forkel	Abstract:  We investigate the dynamical content of both hard- and soft-wall approximations to holographic QCD by deriving the corresponding glueball correlation functions and by confronting them with a variety of QCD results. We further calculate the glueball decay constants in both holographic duals, discuss emerging limitations and improvement strategies, and comment on a recent attempt to generalize the glueball correlator in the soft-wall background. 
0808.00305	Iron pnictides as a new setting for quantum criticality	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Jianhui Dai, Qimiao Si, Jian-Xin Zhu, Elihu Abrahams	Abstract:  Two major themes in the physics of condensed matter are quantum critical phenomena and unconventional superconductivity. These usually occur in the context of competing interactions in systems of strongly-correlated electrons. All this interesting physics comes together in the behavior of the recently discovered iron pnictide compounds that have generated enormous interest because of their moderately high-temperature superconductivity. The ubiquity of antiferromagnetic ordering in their phase diagrams naturally raises the question of the relevance of magnetic quantum criticality, but the answer remains uncertain both theoretically and experimentally. Here we show that the undoped iron pnictides feature a novel type of magnetic quantum critical point, which results from a competition between electronic localization and itinerancy. Our theory provides a mechanism to understand the experimentally-observed variation of the ordered moment among the undoped iron pnictides. We suggest P substitution for As in the undoped iron pnictides as a means to access this new example of magnetic quantum criticality in an unmasked fashion. Our findings point to the iron pnictides as a much-needed new setting for quantum criticality, one that offers a new set of control parameters. 
0808.00306	Exceptional (Z/2Z) x (Z/2Z)-symmetric spaces	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Andreas Kollross	Abstract:  The notion of (Z/2Z) x (Z/2Z)-symmetric spaces is a generalization of classical symmetric spaces, where the group Z/2Z is replaced by (Z/2Z) x (Z/2Z). In this article, a classification is given of the (Z/2Z) x (Z/2Z)-symmetric spaces G/K where G is an exceptional compact Lie group or Spin(8), complementing recent results of Bahturin and Goze. Our results are equivalent to a classification of (Z/2Z) x (Z/2Z)-gradings on the exceptional simple Lie algebras e6, e7, e8, f4, g2 and so(8). 
0808.00307	A high bandwidth quantum repeater	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:W. J. Munro, R. Van Meter, Sebastien G.R. Louis, Kae Nemoto	Abstract:  We present a physical- and link-level design for the creation of entangled pairs to be used in quantum repeater applications where one can control the noise level of the initially distributed pairs. The system can tune dynamically, trading initial fidelity for success probability, from high fidelity pairs (F=0.98 or above) to moderate fidelity pairs. The same physical resources that create the long-distance entanglement are used to implement the local gates required for entanglement purification and swapping, creating a homogeneous repeater architecture. Optimizing the noise properties of the initially distributed pairs significantly improves the rate of generating long-distance Bell pairs. Finally, we discuss the performance trade-off between spatial and temporal resources. 
0808.00308	Notes on periodic elements of Garside groups	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Eon-Kyung Lee, Sang-Jin Lee	Abstract:  Let $G$ be a Garside group with Garside element $Δ$. An element $g$ in $G$ is said to be \emph{periodic} if some power of $g$ lies in the cyclic group generated by $Δ$. This paper shows the following. (i) The periodicity of an element does not depend on the choice of a particular Garside structure if and only if the center of $G$ is cyclic. (ii) If $g^k=Δ^{ka}$ for some nonzero integer $k$, then $g$ is conjugate to $Δ^a$. (iii) Every finite subgroup of the quotient group $G/<Δ^m>$ is cyclic, where $Δ^m$ is the minimal positive central power of $Δ$. 
0808.00309	A Reliable SVD based Watermarking Schem	Multimedia (cs.MM)	Authors:Chirag Jain, Siddharth Arora, Prasanta K. Panigrahi	Abstract:  We propose a novel scheme for watermarking of digital images based on singular value decomposition (SVD), which makes use of the fact that the SVD subspace preserves significant amount of information of an image, as compared to its singular value matrix, Zhang and Li (2005). The principal components of the watermark are embedded in the original image, leaving the detector with a complimentary set of singular vectors for watermark extraction. The above step invariably ensures that watermark extraction from the embedded watermark image, using a modified matrix, is not possible, thereby removing a major drawback of an earlier proposed algorithm by Liu and Tan (2002). 
0808.00310	Relativistic Flows in TeV Blazars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Amir Levinson	Abstract:  Rapid variability of the TeV emission in several blazars implies a central black hole mass $M_{BH}<10^8M_\odot$, appreciably smaller than the values estimated from the $M_{BH}-L_{bulg}$ relation, and Doppler factors for the $γ$-ray emitting fluid much larger than those associated with radio patterns. We discuss the conditions in the central engine required to account for the short timescales and large luminosities observed, and propose some explanations for the inferred kinematics of the source on various scales. 
0808.00311	Gamma Ray Spectrum Unfolding Using Derivative Kernels	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:D. S. Vlachos, O. T. Kosmas	Abstract:  The unfolding of a gamma ray spectrum experience many difficulties due to noise in the recorded data, that is based mainly on the change of photon energy due to scattering mechanisms (either in the detector or the medium), the accumulation of recorded counts in a fixed energy interval (the channel width of the detector) and finally the statistical fluctuation inside the detector. In order to deal with these problems, a new method is developed which interpolates the ideal spectrum with the use of special designed derivative kernels. Preliminary simulation results are presented and show that this approach is very effective even in spectra with low statistics. 
0808.00312	Radius and surface tension of microscopic bubbles by second gradient theory	Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)	Authors:Francesco Dell'Isola, Henri Gouin (M2P2), Pierre Seppecher (IMT)    	Abstract:  The classical theory of Laplace is not suitable for describing the behavior of microscopic bubbles. The theory of second gradient fluids (which are able to exert shear stresses in equilibrium conditions) allows us to obtain a new expression for surface tension and radius of these bubbles in terms of functionals of the chemical potential. This relationship allows us to generalize the results of Cahn-Hilliard and Tolman. 
0808.00313	On a local characterization of pseudoconvex domains	Complex Variables (math.CV)	Authors:Nikolai Nikolov, Peter Pflug, Pascal J. Thomas, Wlodzimierz Zwonek	Abstract:  Pseudoconvexity of a domain in $\Bbb C^n$ is described in terms of the existence of a locally defined plurisubharmonic/holomorphic function near any boundary point that is unbounded at the point. 
0808.00314	Field theory of bi- and tetracritical points: Statics	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:R. Folk, Yu. Holovatch, G. Moser	Abstract:  We calculate the static critical behavior of systems of $O(n_\|)\oplus O(n_\perp)$ symmetry by renormalization group method within the minimal subtraction scheme in two loop order. Summation methods lead to fixed points describing multicritical behavior. Their stability boarder lines in the space of order parameter components $n_\|$ and $n_\perp$ and spatial dimension $d$ are calculated. The essential features obtained already in two loop order for the interesting case of an antiferromagnet in a magnetic field ($n_\|=1$, $n_\perp=2$) are the stability of the biconical fixed point and the neighborhood of the stability border lines to the other fixed points leading to very small transient exponents. We are also able to calculate the flow of static couplings, which allows to consider the attraction region. Depending on the nonuniversal background parameters the existence of different multicritical behavior (bicritical or tetracritical) is possible including a triple point. 
0808.00315	Can the cosmological "constant" run? - It may run	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Ilya L. Shapiro, Joan Sola	Abstract:  Using standard quantum field theory, we discuss several theoretical aspects of the possible running of the cosmological constant (CC) term in Einstein's equations. The basic motivation for the present work is to emphasize that this possibility should also be taken into account when considering dynamical models for the dark energy (DE), which are nowadays mainly focused on identifying the DE with the energy density associated to one or more ad hoc scalar fields. At the same time, we address some recent criticisms that have been published (or privately communicated to us) attempting to cast doubts on the fundamental possibility of such running. In this work, we argue that while there is no comprehensive proof of the CC running, there is no rigorous proof of the non-running either. In particular, some purported "non-running theorem" recently adduced in the literature is, in our opinion, completely insubstantial and formally incorrect. The way to the CC running is, therefore, still open and we take here the opportunity to present a pedagogical review of the present state of the art in this field, including a a brief historical account. 
0808.00316	Smooth Structures and Normalized Ricci Flows on Non-Simply Connected Four-Manifolds	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Masashi Ishida, Ioana Suvaina	Abstract:  A solution to the normalized Ricci flow is called non-singular if it exists for all time with uniformly bounded sectional curvature. By using the techniques developed by the present authors, we study the existence or non-existence of non-singular solutions of the normalized Ricci flow on 4-manifolds with non-trivial fundamental group and the relation with the smooth structures. For example, we prove that, for any finite cyclic group ${\mathbb Z}_{d}$, where $d>1$, there exists a compact topological 4-manifold $X$ with fundamental group ${\mathbb Z}_{d}$, which admits at least one smooth structure for which non-singular solutions of the normalized Ricci flow exist, but also admits infinitely many distinct smooth structures for which {\it no} non-singular solution of the normalized Ricci flow exists. Related non-existence results on non-singular solutions are also proved. Among others, we show that there are no non-singular $\ZZ_d-$equivariant solutions to the normalized Ricci flow on appropriate connected sums of $\bcp ^2$s and $\cpb $s ($d>1$). 
0808.00317	A generalization of the Widder potential transform and applications	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Nese Dernek, Veli Kurt, Yilmaz Simsek, Osman Yurekli	Abstract:  In the present paper the authors consider the $\mathcal{P}_{ν,2}$-transform as a generalization of the Widder potential transform and the Glasser transform. The $\mathcal{P}_{ν,2}$-transform is obtained as an iteration of the the $\mathcal{L}_{2}$-transform with itself. Many identities involving these transforms are given. By making use of these identities, a number of new Parseval-Goldstein type identities are obtained for these and many other well-known integral transforms. The identities proven in this paper are shown to give rise to useful corollaries for evaluating infinite integrals of special functions. Some examples are also given as illustration of the results presented here. 
0808.00318	Crossing the Cosmological Constant Line on a Warped DGP Brane	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Kourosh Nozari, N. Behrouz, T. Azizi, B. Fazlpour	Abstract:  We study dynamics of the equation of state parameter for a dark energy component non-minimally coupled to induced gravity on a warped DGP brane. We show that there are appropriate domains of the model parameters space that account for crossing of the phantom divide line. This crossing, which is possible for both branches of the scenario, depends explicitly on the values of the non-minimal coupling and warp factor. The effect of warp factor appears in the value of the redshift parameter at which phantom divide line crossing occurs. 
0808.00319	Double shuffle relation for associators	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Hidekazu Furusho	Abstract:  It is proved that Drinfel'd's pentagon equation implies the generalized double shuffle relation. As a corollary, an embedding from the Grothendieck-Teichmüller group $GRT_1$ into Racinet's double shuffle group $DMR_0$ is obtained, which settles the project of Deligne-Terasoma. It is also proved that the gamma factorization formula follows from the generalized double shuffle relation. 
0808.00320	Stellar Population Constraints on the Dark Matter Content and Origin of Ultra-Compact Dwarf Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Igor Chilingarian, Veronique Cayatte, Gilles Bergond	Abstract:  We analyse intermediate-resolution VLT FLAMES/Giraffe spectra of six ultra-compact dwarf (UCD) galaxies in the Fornax cluster. We obtained velocity dispersions and stellar population properties by full spectral fitting against PEGASE.HR models. Objects span a large range of metallicities (-0.95 to -0.23 dex), 4 of them are older than 8 Gyr. Comparison of the stellar and dynamical masses suggests that UCDs have little dark matter at best. For one object, UCD3, the Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) results in the stellar mass significantly exceeding the dynamical one, whereas for the Kroupa IMF the values coincide. Although, this object may have peculiar dynamics or/and stellar populations, the Kroupa IMF seems more realistic. We find that UCDs lie well above the metallicity-luminosity relation of early-type galaxies. The same behaviour is demonstrated by some of the massive Milky Way globular clusters, known to contain composite stellar populations. Our results support two following UCD formation scenarii: (1) tidal stripping of nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies; (2) formation of tidal superclusters in galaxy mergers. We also discuss some of the alternative channels of the UCD formation binding them to globular clusters. 
0808.00321	Flux networks in metabolic graphs	Molecular Networks (q-bio.MN)	Authors:Patrick B. Warren, Silvio M. Duarte Queiros, Janette L. Jones	Abstract:  A metabolic model can be represented as bipartite graph comprising linked reaction and metabolite nodes. Here it is shown how a network of conserved fluxes can be assigned to the edges of such a graph by combining the reaction fluxes with a conserved metabolite property such as molecular weight. A similar flux network can be constructed by combining the primal and dual solutions to the linear programming problem that typically arises in constraint-based modelling. Such constructions may help with the visualisation of flux distributions in complex metabolic networks. The analysis also explains the strong correlation observed between metabolite shadow prices (the dual linear programming variables) and conserved metabolite properties. The methods were applied to recent metabolic models for Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Methanosarcina barkeri. Detailed results are reported for E. coli; similar results were found for the other organisms. 
0808.00322	Anomalous WW $γ$ coupling in photon-induced processes using forward detectors at the LHC	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:O. Kepka, C. Royon	Abstract:  We present a new method to test the Standard Model expectations at the LHC using photon-induced $WW$ production. Both $W$ decay in the main ATLAS or CMS detectors while scattered protons are measured in forward detectors. The sensitivity to anomalous $WWγ$ triple gauge coupling can be improved by more than a factor 5 or 30 compared to the present LEP or Tevatron sensitivity respectively. 
0808.00323	Elastic nonlinearities in a one-dimensional model of fracture	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Eran Bouchbinder, Ting-Shek Lo	Abstract:  The dynamics of rapid brittle cracks is commonly studied in the framework of linear elastic fracture mechanics where nonlinearities are neglected. However, recent experimental and theoretical work demonstrated explicitly the importance of elastic nonlinearities in fracture dynamics. We study two simple one-dimensional models of fracture in order to gain insights about the role of elastic nonlinearities and the implications of their exclusion in the common linear elastic approximation. In one model we consider the decohesion of a nonlinear elastic membrane from a substrate. In a second model we follow the philosophy of linear elastic fracture mechanics and study a linearized version of the nonlinear model. By analyzing the steady state solutions, the velocity-load relations and the response to perturbations of the two models we show that the linear approximation fails at finite crack tip velocities. We highlight certain features of the breakdown of the linear theory and discuss possible implications of our results to higher dimensional systems. 
0808.00324	Thermodynamics on Noncommutative Geometry in Coherent State Formalism	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Wung-Hong Huang, Kuo-Wei Huang	Abstract:  The thermodynamics of ideal gas on the noncommutative geometry in the coherent state formalism is investigated. We first evaluate the statistical interparticle potential and see that there are residual "attraction (repulsion) potential" between boson (fermion) in the high temperature limit. The characters could be traced to the fact that, the particle with mass $m$ in noncommutative thermal geometry with noncommutativity $θ$ and temperature $T$ will correspond to that in the commutative background with temperature $T(1+kTmθ)^{-1}$. Such a correspondence implies that the ideal gas energy will asymptotically approach to a finite limiting value as that on commutative geometry at $T_θ= (kmθ)^{-1}$. We also investigate the squeezed coherent states and see that they could have arbitrary mean energy. The thermal properties of those systems are calculated and compared to each other. We find that the heat capacity of the squeezed coherent states of boson and fermion on the noncommutative geometry have different values, contrast to that on the commutative geometry. 
0808.00325	Metamagnetic transition in EuFe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Shuai Jiang, Yongkang Luo, Zhi Ren, Zengwei Zhu, Cao Wang, Xiangfan Xu, Qian Tao, Guanghan Cao, Zhu'an Xu	Abstract:  We report the measurements of anisotropic magnetization and magnetoresistance on single crystals of EuFe$_2$As$_2$, a parent compound of ferro-arsenide high-temperature superconductor. Apart from the antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-density-wave transition at 186 K associated with Fe moments, the compound undergoes another magnetic phase transition at 19 K due to AFM ordering of Eu$^{2+}$ spins ($J=S=7/2$). The latter AFM state exhibits metamagnetic transition under magnetic fields. Upon applying magnetic field with $H\parallel c$ at 2 K, the magnetization increases linearly to 7.0 $μ_{B}$/f.u. at $μ_{0}H$=1.7 T, then keeps at this value of saturated Eu$^{2+}$ moments under higher fields. In the case of $H\parallel ab$, the magnetization increases step-like to 6.6 $μ_{B}$/f.u. with small magnetic hysteresis. A metamagnetic phase was identified with the saturated moments of 4.4 $μ_{B}$/f.u. The metamagnetic transition accompanies with negative in-plane magnetoresistance, reflecting the influence of Eu$^{2+}$ moments ordering on the electrical conduction of FeAs layers. The results were explained in terms of spin-reorientation and spin-reversal based on an $A$-type AFM structure for Eu$^{2+}$ spins. The magnetic phase diagram has been established. 
0808.00326	Towards nonlinear quantum Fokker-Planck equations	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Roumen Tsekov	Abstract:  It is demonstrated how the equilibrium semiclassical approach of Coffey et al. can be improved to describe more correctly the evolution. As a result a new semiclassical Klein-Kramers equation for the Wigner function is derived, which remains quantum for a free quantum Brownian particle as well. It is transformed to a semiclassical Smoluchowski equation, which leads to our semiclassical generalization of the classical Einstein law of Brownian motion derived before. A possibility is discussed how to extend these semiclassical equations to nonlinear quantum Fokker-Planck equations based on the Fisher information. 
0808.00327	Strengthened large deviations for rational maps and full shifts, with unified proof	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Henri Comman	Abstract:  For any hyperbolic rational map and any net of Borel probability measures on the space of Borel probability measures on the Julia set, we show that this net satisfies a strong form of the large deviation principle with a rate function given by the entropy map if and only if the large deviation and the pressure functionals coincide. To each such principles corresponds a new expression for the entropy of invariant measures. We give the explicit form of the rate function of the corresponding large deviation principle in the real line for the net of image measures obtained by evaluating the function $\log|T'|$. These results are applied to various examples including those considered in the literature where only upper bounds have been proved. The proof rests on some entropy-approximation property (independent of the net of measures), which in a suitable formulation, is nothing but the hypothesis involving exposed points in Baldi's theorem. In particular, it works verbatim for general dynamical systems. After stating the corresponding general version, as another example we consider the multidimensional full shift for which the above property has been recently proved, and we establish large deviation principles for nets of measures analogous to those of the rational maps case. 
0808.00328	Effect of Zn doping on magnetic order and superconductivity in LaFeAsO	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Yuke Li, Xiao Lin, Qian Tao, Cao Wang, Tong Zhou, Linjun Li, Qingbo Wang, Mi He, Guanghan Cao, Zhu'an Xu	Abstract:  We report Zn-doping effect in the parent and F-doped LaFeAsO oxy-arsenides. Slight Zn doping in LaFe$_{1-x}$Zn$_{x}$AsO drastically suppresses the resistivity anomaly around 150 K associated with the antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin density wave (SDW) in the parent compound. The measurements of magnetic susceptibility and thermopower confirm further the effect of Zn doping on AFM order. Meanwhile Zn doping does not affect or even enhances the $T_c$ of LaFe$_{1-x}$Zn$_{x}$AsO$_{0.9}$F$_{0.1}$, in contrast to the effect of Zn doping in high-$T_c$ cuprates. We found that the solubility of Zn content ($x$) is limited to less than 0.1 in both systems and further Zn doping (i.e., $x$ $\geq$ 0.1) causes phase separation. Our study clearly indicates that the non-magnetic impurity of Zn$^{2+}$ ions doped in the Fe$_2$As$_2$ layers affects selectively the AFM order, and superconductivity remains robust against the Zn doping in the F-doped superconductors. 
0808.00329	Use of a nanoindentation fatigue test to characterize the ductile-brittle transition	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Mathieu Skrzypczak (LTDS), Christelle Guerret-Piecourt (LTDS), Sandrine Bec (LTDS), Jean-Luc Loubet (LTDS), Olivier Guerret	Abstract:  When considering grinding of minerals, scaling effect induces competition between plastic deformation and fracture in brittle solids. The competition can be sketched by a critical size of the material, which characterizes the ductile-brittle transition. A first approach using Vickers indentation gives a good approximation of the critical size through an extrapolation from the macroscopic to the microscopic scales. Nanoindentation tests confirm this experimental value. According to the grain size compared to the indent size, it can reasonably be said that the mode of damage is deformation-induced intragranular microfracture. This technique also enables to perform cyclic indentations to examine calcite fatigue resistance. Repeated loadings with a nanoindenter on CaCO3 polycrystalline samples produce cumulative mechanical damage. It is also shown that the transition between ductile and brittle behaviour depends on the number of indentation cycles. The ductile domain can be reduced when the material is exposed to a fatigue process. 
0808.00330	Unified approach to structure factors and neutrino processes in nucleon matter	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:G.I. Lykasov, C.J. Pethick, A. Schwenk	Abstract:  We present a unified approach to neutrino processes in nucleon matter based on Landau's theory of Fermi liquids that includes one- and two-quasiparticle-quasihole pair states as well as mean-field effects. We show how rates of neutrino processes involving two nucleons may be calculated in terms of the collision integral in the Landau transport equation for quasiparticles. Using a relaxation time approximation, we solve the transport equation for density and spin-density fluctuations and derive a general form for the response functions. We apply our approach to neutral-current processes in neutron matter, where the spin response function is crucial for calculations of neutrino elastic and inelastic scattering, neutrino-pair bremsstrahlung and absorption from strongly-interacting nucleons. We calculate the relaxation rates using modern nuclear interactions and including many-body contributions, and find that rates of neutrino processes are reduced compared with estimates based on the one-pion exchange interaction, which is used in current simulations of core-collapse supernovae. 
0808.00331	Flavorful $Z^\prime$ signatures at LHC and ILC	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Shao-Long Chen, Nobuchika Okada	Abstract:  There are lots of new physics models which predict an extra neutral gauge boson, referred as Z'-boson. In a certain class of these new physics models, the Z'-boson has flavor-dependent couplings with the fermions in the Standard Model (SM). Based on a simple model in which couplings of the SM fermions in the third generation with the Z'-boson are different from those of the corresponding fermions in the first two generations, we study the signatures of Z'-boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the International Linear Collider (ILC). We show that at the LHC, the Z'-boson with mass around 1 TeV can be produced through the Drell-Yan processes and its dilepton decay modes provide us clean signatures not only for the resonant production of Z'-boson but also for flavor-dependences of the production cross sections. We also study fermion pair productions at the ILC involving the virtual Z'-boson exchange. Even though the center-of-energy of the ILC is much lower than a Z'-boson mass, the angular distributions and the forward-backward asymmetries of fermion pair productions show not only sizable deviations from the SM predictions but also significant flavor-dependences. 
0808.00332	Antimatter cosmic rays from dark matter annihilation: First results from an N-body experiment	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. Lavalle, E. Nezri, F.-S. Ling, L. Athanassoula, R. Teyssier	Abstract:  [Abridged]. We take advantage of the galaxy-like 3D dark matter map extracted from the HORIZON Project results to calculate the positron and antiproton fluxes from dark matter annihilation, in a model-independent approach as well as for dark matter particle benchmarks relevant at the LHC scale (from supersymmetric and extra-dimensional theories). Such a study is dedicated to a better estimate of the theoretical uncertainties affecting predictions, while the PAMELA and GLAST satellites are currently taking data which will soon provide better observational constraints. We discuss the predictions of the antiproton and positron fluxes, and of the positron fraction as well, as compared to the current data. We finally discuss the limits of the Nbody framework in describing the dark matter halo of our Galaxy. 
0808.00333	Measurement of Semileptonic B Decays into Orbitally Excited Charmed Mesons	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We present a study of B decays into semileptonic final states containing charged and neutral $D_1(2420)$ and $D_2^*(2460)$. The analysis is based on a data sample of $208 fb^{-1}$ collected at the $Υ(4S)$ resonance with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy $B$ Factory at SLAC. With a simultaneous fit to four different decay chains, the semileptonic branching fractions are extracted from measurements of the mass difference $Δ m=m(D**)-m(D)$ distributions. Product branching fractions are determined to be $BR(B^+ -> D_1^0 \ell^+ ν_{\ell}) x BR(D_1^0 -> D*^+ π^-) = (2.97 +/- 0.17 +/- 0.17) x 10^{-3}$, $BR(B^+ -> D_2^{*0} \ell^+ ν_{\ell}) x BR(D_2^{*0} -> D^{(*)+} π^-) = (2.29 +/- 0.23 +/- 0.21) x 10^{-3}$, $BR(B^0 -> D_1^- \ell^+ ν_{\ell}) x BR(D_1^- -> D*^0 π^-) = (2.78 +/- 0.24 +/- 0.25) 10^{-3}$ and $BR(B^0 -> D_2^{*-} \ell^+ ν_{\ell}) x BR(D_2^{*-} -> D^{(*)0} π^-) = (1.77 +/- 0.26 +-/ 0.11) 10^{-3}$. In addition we measure the branching ratio $Γ(D_2^* -> D π^-)/Γ(D_2^* -> D^{(*)} π^-) = 0.62 +/- 0.03 +/- 0.02$. 
0808.00334	Employing trapped cold ions to verify the quantum Jarzynski equality	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Gerhard Huber, Ferdinand Schmidt-Kaler, Sebastian Deffner, Eric Lutz	Abstract:  We propose a scheme to investigate the nonequilibrium work distribution of a quantum particle under well controlled transformations of the external potential, exploiting the versatility of a single ion in a segmented linear Paul trap. We describe in detail how the motional quantum state of a single ion can be prepared, manipulated and finally read out to fully determine the free energy difference in both harmonic and anharmonic potentials. Uniquely to our system, we show how an ion may be immersed in an engineered laser--field reservoir. Trapped ions therefore represent an ideal tool for investigating the Jarzynski equality in open and closed quantum systems. 
0808.00335	Origin of the reduced exchange bias in epitaxial FeNi(111)/CoO(111) bilayer	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:F. Radu, S. K. Mishra, I. Zizak, A. I. Erko, H. A. Durr, W. Eberhardt, G. Nowak, S. Buschhorn, K. Zhernenkov, M. Wolff, H. Zabel, D. Schmitz, E. Schierle, E. Dudzik, R. Feyerherm	Abstract:  We have employed Soft and Hard X-ray Resonant Magnetic Scattering and Polarised Neutron Diffraction to study the magnetic interface and the bulk antiferromagnetic domain state of the archetypal epitaxial Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$(111)/CoO(111) exchange biased bilayer. The combination of these scattering tools provides unprecedented detailed insights into the still incomplete understanding of some key manifestations of the exchange bias effect. We show that the several orders of magnitude difference between the expected and measured value of exchange bias field is caused by an almost anisotropic in-plane orientation of antiferromagnetic domains. Irreversible changes of their configuration lead to a training effect. This is directly seen as a change in the magnetic half order Bragg peaks after magnetization reversal. A 30 nm size of antiferromagnetic domains is extracted from the width the (1/2 1/2 1/2) antiferromagnetic magnetic peak measured both by neutron and x-ray scattering. A reduced blocking temperature as compared to the measured antiferromagnetic ordering temperature clearly corresponds to the blocking of antiferromagnetic domains. Moreover, an excellent correlation between the size of the antiferromagnetic domains, exchange bias field and frozen-in spin ratio is found, providing a comprehensive understanding of the origin of exchange bias in epitaxial systems. 
0808.00336	Canted-spin-caused electric dipoles: a local symmetry theory	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:T. A. Kaplan, S. D. Mahanti	Abstract:  A pair of magnetic atoms with canted spins Sa, Sb can give rise to an electric dipole moment P. Several forms for the behavior of such a moment have appeared in the theoretical literature, some of which have been invoked to explain experimental results found in various multiferroic materials. The forms specifically are P1 ~ R x (Sa x Sb); P2 ~ Sa x Sb, and P3 ~ Sa (R . Sa) - Sb (R . Sb), where R is the relative position of the atoms and Sa, Sb are unit vectors. To unify and generalize these various forms we consider P as the most general quadratic function of the spin components that vanishes whenever Sa and Sb are collinear, i.e. we consider the most general expressions that require spin canting. The study reveals new forms. We generalize to the vector P, Moriya's symmetry considerations regarding the (scalar) Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya energy D. Sa x Sb (which led to restrictions on D). This provides a rigorous symmetry argument which shows that P1 is allowed no matter how high the symmetry of the atoms plus environment, and gives restrictions for all other contributions. The analysis leads to the suggestion of terms omitted in the existing microscopic models, suggests a new mechanism behind the ferroelectricity found in the 'proper screw structure' of CuXO2, X=Fe, Cr, and predicts an unusual antiferroelectric ordering in the antiferromagnetically and ferroelectrically ordered phase of RbFe(MoO4)2. 
0808.00337	Non-standard approximations of the Ito-map	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Peter Friz, Harald Oberhauser	Abstract:  The Wong-Zakai theorem asserts that ODEs driven by "reasonable" (e.g. piecewise linear) approximations of Brownian motion converge to the corresponding Stratonovich stochastic differential equation. With the aid of rough path analysis, we study "non-reasonable" approximations and go beyond a well-known criterion of [Ikeda--Watanabe, North Holland 1989] in the sense that our result applies to perturbations on all levels, exhibiting additional drift terms involving any iterated Lie brackets of the driving vector fields. In particular, this applies to the approximations by McShane ('72) and Sussmann ('91). Our approach is not restricted to Brownian driving signals. At last, these ideas can be used to prove optimality of certain rough path estimates. 
0808.00338	Geometric quantization of integrable systems with hyperbolic singularities	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Mark D. Hamilton, Eva Miranda	Abstract:  We construct the geometric quantization of a compact surface using a singular real polarization coming from an integrable system. Such a polarization always has singularities, which we assume to be of nondegenerate type. In particular, we compute the effect of hyperbolic singularities, which make an infinite-dimensional contribution to the quantization, thus showing that this quantization depends strongly on polarization. 
0808.00339	A 3D discrete model of the diaphragm and human trunk	Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)	Authors:Emmanuel Promayon (TIMC), Pierre Baconnier (TIMC)    	Abstract:  In this paper, a 3D discrete model is presented to model the movements of the trunk during breathing. In this model, objects are represented by physical particles on their contours. A simple notion of force generated by a linear actuator allows the model to create forces on each particle by way of a geometrical attractor. Tissue elasticity and contractility are modeled by local shape memory and muscular fibers attractors. A specific dynamic MRI study was used to build a simple trunk model comprised of by three compartments: lungs, diaphragm and abdomen. This model was registered on the real geometry. Simulation results were compared qualitatively as well as quantitatively to the experimental data, in terms of volume and geometry. A good correlation was obtained between the model and the real data. Thanks to this model, pathology such as hemidiaphragm paralysis can also be simulated. 
0808.00340	Discrete Thermodynamics of Chemical Equilibria	Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)	Authors:B. Zilbergleyt	Abstract:  The paper sets forth comprehensive basics of Discrete Thermodynamics of Chemical Equilibria (DTD), developed by the author during the last decade and spread over series of publications. Based on the linear equations of irreversible thermodynamics, De Donder's definition of the thermodynamic force, and the Le Chatelier principle, DTD brings forward a notion of chemical equilibrium as a balance of internal and external thermodynamic forces, acting against a chemical system. The basic expression of DTD is a logistic map that ties together energetic characteristics of the chemical transformation in the system, its deviation from true thermodynamic equilibrium, and the sum of thermodynamic forces, causing that deviation. System deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium is the major variable of the theory. Solutions to the basic map define the chemical system domain of states comprising bifurcation diagrams with four areas, from true thermodynamic equilibrium to chaos, having specific distinctive meaning for chemical systems. The theory is derived from the currently recognized ideas of chemical thermodynamics and binds classical and contemporary thermodynamics of chemical equilibria into a unique concept. DTD opens new opportunities in understanding and analysis of equilibria in chemical systems. Some new results, included in the paper, have never been published before. 
0808.00341	Contamination cannot explain the lack of large-scale power in the cosmic microwave background radiation	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Emory F. Bunn, Austin Bourdon	Abstract:  Several anomalies appear to be present in the large-angle cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy maps of WMAP. One of these is a lack of large-scale power. Because the data otherwise match standard models extremely well, it is natural to consider perturbations of the standard model as possible explanations. We show that, as long as the source of the perturbation is statistically independent of the source of the primary CMB anisotropy, no such model can explain this large-scale power deficit. On the contrary, any such perturbation always reduces the probability of obtaining any given low value of large-scale power. We rigorously prove this result when the lack of large-scale power is quantified with a quadratic statistic, such as the quadrupole moment. When a statistic based on the integrated square of the correlation function is used instead, we present strong numerical evidence in support of the result. The result applies to models in which the geometry of spacetime is perturbed (e.g., an ellipsoidal Universe) as well as explanations involving local contaminants, undiagnosed foregrounds, or systematic errors. Because the large-scale power deficit is arguably the most significant of the observed anomalies, explanations that worsen this discrepancy should be regarded with great skepticism, even if they help in explaining other anomalies such as multipole alignments. 
0808.00342	Resonance signals in pion-nucleon scattering from speed plots and time delay	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:R.L.Workman, R.A.Arndt	Abstract:  We compare a number of methods used to locate resonances. These include the speed plot, the time-delay method of Eisenbud and Wigner, the time-delay matrix of Smith, and a modification by Ohmura. Numerical results show a consistency not previously reported. One time delay method gives the most consistent results, supporting the conclusions of a recent theoretical study.

0808.00344	Proton and Neutrino Extragalactic Astronomy	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Paolo Lipari	Abstract:  The study of extragalactic sources of high energy radiation via the direct measurement of the proton and neutrino fluxes that they are likely to emit is one of the main goals for the future observations of the recently developed air showers detectors and neutrino telescopes. In this work we discuss the relation between the inclusive proton and neutrino signals from the ensemble of all sources in the universe, and the resolved signals from the closest and brightest objects. We also compare the sensitivities of proton and neutrino telescopes and comment on the relation between these two new astronomies. 
0808.00345	Quantized dual graded graphs	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Thomas Lam	Abstract:  We study quantized dual graded graphs, which are graphs equipped with linear operators satisfying the relation DU - qUD = rI.

0808.00346	Observation of a novel orbital selective Mott transition in Ca$_{1.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$RuO$_4$	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:M. Neupane, P. Richard, Z.-H. Pan, Y. Xu, R. Jin, D. Mandrus, X. Dai, Z. Fang, Z. Wang, H. Ding	Abstract:  Electrons in a simple correlated system behave either as itinerant charge carriers or as localized moments. However, there is growing evidence for the coexistence of itinerant electrons and local moments in transition metals with nearly degenerate $d$-orbitals. It demands one or more selective electron orbitals undergo the Mott transition while the others remain itinerant. Here we report the first observation of such an orbital selective Mott transition (OSMT) in Ca$_{1.8}$Sr$_{0.2}$RuO$_4$ by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). While we observed two sets of dispersing bands and Fermi surface associated with the doubly-degenerate $d_{yz}$ and $d_{zx}$ orbitals, the Fermi surface associated with the wider $d_{xy}$ band is missing, a consequence of selective Mott localization. Our theoretical calculations demonstrate that this novel OSMT is mainly driven by the combined effects of interorbital carrier transfer, superlattice potential, and orbital degeneracy, whereas the bandwidth difference plays a less important role. 
0808.00347	Towards a Process for Developing Maintenance Tools in Academia	Software Engineering (cs.SE)	Authors:Holger M. Kienle, Hausi A. Müller	Abstract:  Building of tools--from simple prototypes to industrial-strength applications--is a pervasive activity in academic research. When proposing a new technique for software maintenance, effective tool support is typically required to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. However, even though tool building is both pervasive and requiring significant time and effort, it is still pursued in an ad hoc manner. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a dedicated development process for tool building that takes the unique characteristics of an academic research environment into account. We first identify process requirements based on a review of the literature and our extensive tool building experience in the domain of maintenance tools. We then outline a process framework based on work products that accommodates the requirements while providing needed flexibility for tailoring the process to account for specific tool building approaches and project constraints. The work products are concrete milestones of the process, tracking progress, rationalizing (design) decisions, and documenting the current state of the tool building project. Thus, the work products provide important input for strategic project decisions and rapid initiation of new team members. Leveraging a dedicated tool building process promises tools that are designed, build, and maintained in a more disciplined, predictable and efficient manner. 
0808.00348	On implicit ODEs with hexagonal web of solutions	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:S.I.Agafonov	Abstract:  Solutions of an implicit ODE form a web. Already for cubic ODEs the 3-web of solutions has a nontrivial local invariant, namely the curvature form. Thus any local classification of implicit ODEs necessarily has functional moduli if no restriction on the class of ODEs is imposed. Here the most symmetric case of hexagonal 3-web of solutions is discussed, i.e. the curvature is supposed to vanish identically. A finite list of normal forms is established under some natural regularity assumptions. Geometrical meaning of these assumptions is that the surface, defined by ODE in the space of 1-jets, is smooth as well as the criminant, which is the critical set of this surface projection to the plane. 
0808.00349	Ultra-high energy cosmic rays from radio galaxies revisited	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jorg P. Rachen (Max-Planck-Institute for Astrophysics, Garching, Germany)    	Abstract:  A striking concentration of ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) events observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory around the direction of the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A revives the idea that radio galaxies may be dominant sources of UHECR. In this paper, we give a brief overview about processes which may accelerate protons and nuclei in radio galaxies, and their relation to jet power, radio morphology and cosmic source density. We argue that, except for the most powerful FR-II radio galaxies, processes in radio lobes are unlikely to explain the origin of UHECR. However, Fermi acceleration of protons at internal shocks in the "blazarzone" of all radio galaxies, and their photohadronic conversion into neutrons, may lead to the ejection of "UHECR-beams", which remain collimated over several Mpc. Consequences of this hypothesis for the interpretation of the UHECR event distribution, in particular for the special case of Centaurus A, are discussed. 
0808.00350	Livsic theorem for matrix cocycles	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Boris Kalinin	Abstract:  We prove the Livšic Theorem for arbitrary $GL(m,\mathbb R)$ cocycles. We consider a hyperbolic dynamical system $f : X \to X$ and a Hölder continuous function $A: X \to GL(m,\mathbb R)$. We show that if $A$ has trivial periodic data, i.e. $A(f^{n-1} p) ... A(fp) A(p) = Id$ for each periodic point $p=f^n p$, then there exists a Hölder continuous function $C: X \to GL(m,\mathbb R)$ satisfying $A (x) = C(f x) C(x) ^{-1}$ for all $x \in X$. The main new ingredients in the proof are results of independent interest on relations between the periodic data, Lyapunov exponents, and uniform estimates on growth of products along orbits for an arbitrary Hölder function $A$. 
0808.00351	Cosmological Measures without Volume Weighting	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Don N. Page	Abstract:  Many cosmologists (myself included) have advocated volume weighting for the cosmological measure problem, weighting spatial hypersurfaces by their volume. However, this often leads to the Boltzmann brain problem, that almost all observations would be by momentary Boltzmann brains that arise very briefly as quantum fluctuations in the late universe when it has expanded to a huge size, so that our observations (too ordered for Boltzmann brains) would be highly atypical and unlikely. Here it is suggested that volume weighting may be a mistake. Volume averaging is advocated as an alternative. One consequence may be a loss of the argument that eternal inflation gives a nonzero probability that our universe now has infinite volume. 
0808.00352	About summability of Fourier-Laplace series	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Anvarjon Akhmedov	Abstract:  In this paper we study the almost everywhere convergence of the expansions related to the self-adjoint extension of the Laplace operator. The sufficient conditions for summability is obtained. For the orders of Riesz means, which greater than critical index $\frac{N-1}{2}$ we established the estimation for maximal operator of the Riesz means. Note that when order $α$ of Riesz means is less than critical index then for establish of the almost everywhere convergence requests to use other methods form proving negative results. We have constructed different method of summability of Laplace series, which based on spectral expansions property of self-adjoint Laplace-Beltrami operator on the unit sphere 
0808.00353	Non-malleable encryption of quantum information	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Andris Ambainis, Jan Bouda, Andreas Winter	Abstract:  We introduce the notion of "non-malleability" of a quantum state encryption scheme (in dimension d): in addition to the requirement that an adversary cannot learn information about the state, here we demand that no controlled modification of the encrypted state can be effected. We show that such a scheme is equivalent to a "unitary 2-design" [Dankert et al.], as opposed to normal encryption which is a unitary 1-design. Our other main results include a new proof of the lower bound of (d^2-1)^2+1 on the number of unitaries in a 2-design [Gross et al.], which lends itself to a generalization to approximate 2-design. Furthermore, while in prime power dimension there is a unitary 2-design with =< d^5 elements, we show that there are always approximate 2-designs with O(epsilon^{-2} d^4 log d) elements. 
0808.00354	A new search for variable stars in the globular cluster NGC 6366	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Arellano Ferro, Sunetra Giridhar, V. Rojas Lopez, R. Figuera, D.M. Bramich, P. Rosenzweig	Abstract:  New CCD photometry of NGC 6366 has lead to the discovery of some variable stars. Two possible Anomalous Cepheids (or Pop II Cepheids), three long period variables, one SX Phe and one eclipsing binary have been found. Also a list of 10 candidate variables is reported. The light curve of the RRab star, V1, has been decomposed into its Fourier harmonics, and the Fourier parameters were used to estimate the star's metallicity and distance; [Fe/H] = -0.87 +- 0.14 and d = 3.2 +- 0.1 kpc. It is argued that V1 may not be a member of the cluster but rather a more distant object. If this is so, an upper limit for the distance to the cluster of 2.8 +- 0.1 kpc can be estimated. The P-L relationship for SX Phe stars and the identified modes in the newly discovered SX Phe variable, V6, allow yet another independent determination of the distance to the cluster of d = 2.7 \+- 0.1 kpc. The M_V - {\rm [Fe/H]} relationship for RR Lyrae stars is addressed and the case of V1 is discussed. 
0808.00355	Comments on gauge invariant overlaps for marginal solutions in open string field theory	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Isao Kishimoto	Abstract:  We calculate the gauge invariant overlaps for Schnabl/Kiermaier-Okawa-Rastelli-Zwiebach's marginal solution with nonsingular current. The obtained formula is the same as that for Fuchs-Kroyter-Potting/Kiermaier-Okawa's marginal solution, which was already computed by Ellwood. Our result is consistent with the expectation that they may be gauge equivalent. We also comment on a gauge invariant overlap for rolling tachyon solutions in cubic open string field theory. 
0808.00356	Elliptic flow fluctuations and correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:Paul Sorensen (for the STAR Collaboration)    	Abstract:  In this talk, we report an analysis of elliptic flow ($v_2$), non-flow ($δ_{2}$), and $v_2$ fluctuations ($σ_{v_{2}}$) for the STAR collaboration at middle rapidity in $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV Au+Au collisions. We compare the results to models of the fluctuations in the initial eccentricity of the overlap zone. 
0808.00357	The Kuratowski covering conjecture for graphs of order < 10 for the nonorientable surfaces of genus 3 and 4	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Suhkjin Hur	Abstract:  Kuratowski proved that a finite graph embeds in the plane if it does not contain a subdivision of either K_5 or K_{3,3}, called Kuratowski subgraphs. A conjectured generalization of this result to all nonorientable surfaces says that a finite minimal forbidden subgraph for the nonorientable surface of genus g can be written as the union of g+1 Kuratowski subgraphs such that the union of each pair of these fails to embed in the projective plane, the union of each triple of these fails to embed in the Klein bottle if g >= 2, and the union of each triple of these fails to embed in the torus if g >= 3. We show that this conjecture is true for all minimal forbidden subgraphs of order < 10 for the nonorientable surfaces of genus 3 and 4. 
0808.00358	J/$ψ$ absorption in a multicomponent hadron gas	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Dariusz Prorok, Ludwik Turko, David Blaschke	Abstract:  A model for anomalous $J/Ψ$ suppression in high energy heavy ion collisions is presented. As the additional suppression mechanism beyond standard nuclear absorption inelastic $J/Ψ$ scattering with hadronic matter is considered. Hadronic matter is modeled as an evolving multi-component gas of point-like non-interacting particles (MCHG). Estimates for the sound velocity of the MCHG are given and the equation of state is compared with Lattice QCD data in the vicinity of the deconfinement phase transition. The approximate cooling pattern caused by longitudinal expansion is presented. It is shown that under these conditions the resulting $J/Ψ$ suppression pattern agrees well with NA38 and NA50 data. 
0808.00359	Some notable properties of the standard oncology phase I design	Applications (stat.AP)	Authors:Gregory J. Hather, Howard Mackey	Abstract:  We identify three properties of the standard oncology phase I trial design or 3 + 3 design. We show that the standard design implicitly uses isotonic regression to estimate a maximum tolerated dose. We next illustrate the relationship between the standard design and a Bayesian design proposed by Ji et al. (2007). A slight modification to this Bayesian design, under a particular model specification, would assign treatments in a manner identical to the standard design. We finally present calculations revealing the behavior of the standard design in a worst case scenario and compare its behavior with other 3 + 3-like designs. 
0808.00360	Seiberg Duality in Chern-Simons Theory	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Amit Giveon, David Kutasov	Abstract:  We argue that N=2 supersymmetric Chern-Simons theories exhibit a strong-weak coupling Seiberg-type duality. We also discuss supersymmetry breaking in these theories. 
0808.00361	Coulomb excitation at intermediate energies	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:H. Esbensen	Abstract:  Straight line trajectories are commonly used in semi-classical calculations of the first-order Coulomb excitation cross section at intermediate energies, and simple corrections are often made for the distortion of the trajectories that is caused by the Coulomb field. These approximations are tested by comparing to numerical calculations that use exact Coulomb trajectories. In this paper a model is devised for including relativistic effects in the calculations. It converges at high energies towards the relativistic straight-line trajectory approximation and approaches the non-relativistic Coulomb trajectory calculation at low energies. The model is tested against a number of measurements and analyses that have been performed at beam energies between 30 and 70 MeV/nucleon, primarily of quadrupole excitations. Remarkably good agreement is achieved with the previous analyses, and good agreement is also achieved in the few cases, where the B(E$λ$) value is known from other methods. The magnitudes of the relativistic and Coulomb distortion effects are discussed. 
0808.00362	Graph Powers and Graph Homomorphisms	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Hossein Hajiabolhassan, Ali Taherkhani	Abstract:  In this paper we investigate some basic properties of fractional powers. In this regard, we show that for any rational number $1\leq {2r+1\over 2s+1}< og(G)$, $G^{2r+1\over 2s+1}\longrightarrow H$ if and only if $G\longrightarrow H^{-{2s+1\over 2r+1}}.$ Also, for two rational numbers ${2r+1\over 2s+1} < {2p+1\over 2q+1}$ and a non-bipartite graph $G$, we show that $G^{2r+1\over 2s+1} < G^{2p+1\over 2q+1}$. In the sequel, we introduce an equivalent definition for circular chromatic number of graphs in terms of fractional powers. We also present a sufficient condition for equality of chromatic number and circular chromatic number. 
0808.00363	Systematic infrared 2.5-5 micron spectroscopy of nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies with AKARI	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Masatoshi Imanishi (1), Takao Nakagawa, Yoichi Ohyama, Mai Shirahata, Takehiko Wada (2), Takashi Onaka (3), Nagisa Oi (4) ((1) NAO Japan, (2) ISAS/JAXA, (3) Univ. of Tokyo, (4) GUAS)    	Abstract:  We report on the results of systematic infrared 2.5-5 micron spectroscopy of 45 nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z < 0.3 using IRC onboard the AKARI satellite. This paper investigates whether the luminosities of these ULIRGs are dominated by starburst activity, or optically elusive buried AGNs are energetically important. Our criteria include the strengths of the 3.3 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features and the optical depths of absorption features at 3.1 micron due to ice-covered dust grains and at 3.4 micron from bare carbonaceous dust grains. Because of the AKARI IRC's spectroscopic capability in the full 2.5-5 micron wavelength range, unaffected by Earth's atmosphere, we can apply this energy diagnostic method to ULIRGs at z > 0.15. We estimate the intrinsic luminosities of extended (several kpc), modestly obscured (Av < 15 mag) starburst activity based on the 3.3 micron PAH emission luminosities measured in AKARI IRC slitless spectra, and confirm that such starbursts are energetically unimportant in nearby ULIRGs. In roughly half of the observed ULIRGs classified optically as non-Seyferts, we find signatures of luminous energy sources that produce no PAH emission and/or are more centrally concentrated than the surrounding dust. We interpret these energy sources as buried AGNs. The fraction of ULIRGs with detectable buried AGN signatures increases with increasing infrared luminosity. Our overall results support the scenario that luminous buried AGNs are important in many ULIRGs at z < 0.3 classified optically as non-Seyferts, and that the optical undetectability of such buried AGNs occurs merely because of a large amount of nuclear dust, which can make the sightline of even the lowest dust column density opaque to the ionizing radiation of the AGNs. 
0808.00364	About the asymptotic formula for spectral function of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on sphere	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Anvarjon Akhmedov	Abstract:  In this work we established asymptotical behavior for Riesz means of the spectral function of the Laplace operator on unit sphere. 
0808.00365	Ground-state statistics from annealing algorithms: Quantum vs classical approaches	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Yoshiki Matsuda, Hidetoshi Nishimori, Helmut G Katzgraber	Abstract:  We study the performance of quantum annealing for systems with ground-state degeneracy by directly solving the Schrödinger equation for small systems and quantum Monte Carlo simulations for larger systems. The results indicate that naive quantum annealing using a transverse field may not be well suited to identify all degenerate ground-state configurations, although the value of the ground-state energy is often efficiently estimated. An introduction of quantum transitions to all states with equal weights is shown to greatly improve the situation but with a sacrifice in the annealing time. We also clarify the relation between the spin configurations in the degenerate ground states and the probabilities that those states are obtained by quantum annealing. The strengths and weaknesses of quantum annealing for problems with degenerate ground states are discussed in comparison with classical simulated annealing. 
0808.00366	Nuclear shadowing from exclusive quarkonium photoproduction at the BNL RHIC and CERN LHC	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:A. L. Ayala Filho, V. P. Goncalves, M. T. Griep	Abstract:  The photonuclear production of vector mesons in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions is investigated within the collinear approach using different parameterizations for the nuclear gluon distribution. The integrated cross section and the rapidity distribution for the $AA \to V AA$ ($V = J/Ψ, Υ$) process are computed for energies of RHIC and LHC. A comparison with the recent PHENIX data on coherent production of $J/Ψ$ mesons is also presented. We demonstrate that the study of the exclusive quarkonium photoproduction can be used to constrain the nuclear effects in the gluon distribution. 
0808.00367	Physical conditions in potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays: Updated Hillas plot and radiation-loss constraints	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ksenia Ptitsyna, Sergey Troitsky	Abstract:  We review basic constraints on the acceleration of ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays (CRs) in astrophysical sources, namely the geometrical (Hillas) criterion and restrictions from radiation losses in different acceleration regimes. Using the latest available astrophysical data, we redraw the Hillas plot and figure out potential UHECR accelerators. For the acceleration in central engines of active galactic nuclei, we constrain the maximal UHECR energy for a given black-hole mass. Among active galaxies, only the most powerful ones, radio galaxies and blazars, are able to accelerate protons to UHE, though acceleration of heavier nuclei is possible in much more abundant lower-power Seyfert galaxies. 
0808.00368	Global regularity of wave maps V. Large data local wellposedness and perturbation theory in the energy class	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Terence Tao	Abstract:  Using the harmonic map heat flow and the function spaces of Tataru and the author, we establish a large data local well-posedness result in the energy class for wave maps from two-dimensional Minkowski space $\R^{1+2}$ to hyperbolic spaces $\H^m$. This is one of the five claims required in an earlier paper in this series to prove global regularity for such wave maps. 
0808.00369	Quantum Algorithms	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Michele Mosca	Abstract:  This article surveys the state of the art in quantum computer algorithms, including both black-box and non-black-box results. It is infeasible to detail all the known quantum algorithms, so a representative sample is given. This includes a summary of the early quantum algorithms, a description of the Abelian Hidden Subgroup algorithms (including Shor's factoring and discrete logarithm algorithms), quantum searching and amplitude amplification, quantum algorithms for simulating quantum mechanical systems, several non-trivial generalizations of the Abelian Hidden Subgroup Problem (and related techniques), the quantum walk paradigm for quantum algorithms, the paradigm of adiabatic algorithms, a family of ``topological'' algorithms, and algorithms for quantum tasks which cannot be done by a classical computer, followed by a discussion. 
0808.00370	Testable Deviation from Exact Tribimaximal Mixing	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Yoshio Koide, Hiroyuki Nishiura	Abstract:  A simple relation U_{MNS}=V_{CKM}^\dagger U_{TB} between the lepton and quark mixing matrices (U_{MNS} and V_{CKM}) is speculated under an ansatz that U_{MNS} becomes an exact tribimaximal mixing U_{TB} in a limit V_{CKM}={\bf 1}. By using the observed CKM mixing parameters, possible values of neutrino oscillation parameters are estimated: \sin^2 θ_{13}=0.024-0.028, \sin^2 2θ_{23}=0.94-0.95 and \tan^2 θ_{12}=0.24-1.00 depending on phase conventions of U_{TB}. Those values are testable soon by precision measurements in neutrino oscillation experiments. 
0808.00371	Distribution and kinematics of the HCN(3-2) emission down to the innermost region in the envelope of the O-rich star W Hya	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Muller Sebastien, Dinh-V-Trung, He Jin-Hua, Lim Jeremy	Abstract:  We report high angular resolution observations of the HCN (3-2) line emission in the circumstellar envelope of the O-rich star W Hya with the Submillimeter Array. The proximity of this star allows us to image its molecular envelope with a spatial resolution of just ~40 AU, corresponding to about 10 times the stellar diameter. We resolve the HCN (3-2) emission and find that it is centrally peaked and has a roughly spherically symmetrical distribution. This shows that HCN is formed in the innermost region of the envelope (within ~10 stellar radii), which is consistent with predictions from pulsation-driven shock chemistry models, and rules out the scenario in which HCN forms through photochemical reactions in the outer envelope. Our model suggests that the envelope decreases steeply in temperature and increases smoothly in velocity with radius, inconsistent with the standard model for mass-loss driven by radiative pressure on dust grains. We detect a velocity gradient of ~5 km/s in the NW--SE direction over the central 40 AU. This velocity gradient is reminescent of that seen in OH maser lines, and could be caused by the rotation of the envelope or by a weak bipolar outflow. 
0808.00372	The distribution of first-passage times and durations in FOREX and future markets	Trading and Market Microstructure (q-fin.TR)	Authors:Naoya Sazuka, Jun-ichi Inoue, Enrico Scalas	Abstract:  Possible distributions are discussed for intertrade durations and first-passage processes in financial markets. The view-point of renewal theory is assumed. In order to represent market data with relatively long durations, two types of distributions are used, namely, a distribution derived from the so-called Mittag-Leffler survival function and the Weibull distribution. For Mittag-Leffler type distribution, the average waiting time (residual life time) is strongly dependent on the choice of a cut-off parameter t_ max, whereas the results based on the Weibull distribution do not depend on such a cut-off. Therefore, a Weibull distribution is more convenient than a Mittag-Leffler type one if one wishes to evaluate relevant statistics such as average waiting time in financial markets with long durations. On the other side, we find that the Gini index is rather independent of the cut-off parameter. Based on the above considerations, we propose a good candidate for describing the distribution of first-passage time in a market: The Weibull distribution with a power-law tail. This distribution compensates the gap between theoretical and empirical results much more efficiently than a simple Weibull distribution. We also give a useful formula to determine an optimal crossover point minimizing the difference between the empirical average waiting time and the one predicted from renewal theory. Moreover, we discuss the limitation of our distributions by applying our distribution to the analysis of the BTP future and calculating the average waiting time. We find that our distribution is applicable as long as durations follow a Weibull-law for short times and do not have too heavy a tail.

0808.00375	Alternative approach to community detection in networks	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:A.D. Medus, C.O. Dorso	Abstract:  The problem of community detection is relevant in many disciplines of science and modularity optimization is the widely accepted method for this purpose. It has recently been shown that this approach presents a resolution limit by which it is not possible to detect communities with sizes smaller than a threshold which depends on the network size. Moreover, it might happen that the communities resulting from such an approach do not satisfy the usual qualitative definition of commune, i.e., nodes in a commune are more connected among themselves than to nodes outside the commune. In this article we introduce a new method for community detection in complex networks. We define new merit factors based on the weak and strong community definitions formulated by Radicchi et al (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 101, 2658-2663 (2004)) and we show that this local definitions avoid the resolution limit problem found in the modularity optimization approach. 
0808.00376	Volume averaging in the quasispherical Szekeres model	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Krzysztof Bolejko	Abstract:  This paper considers the volume averaging in the quasispherical Szekeres model. The volume averaging became of considerable interest after it was shown that the volume acceleration calculated within the averaging framework can be positive even though the local expansion rate is always decelerating. This issue was intensively studied within spherically symmetric models. However, since our Universe is not spherically symmetric similar analysis is needed in non symmetrical models. This papers presents the averaging analysis within the quasispherical Szekeres model which is a non-symmetrical generalisation of the spherically symmetric Lemaître--Tolman family of models. Density distribution in the quasispherical Szekeres has a structure of a time-dependent mass dipole superposed on a monopole. This paper shows that when calculating the volume acceleration, $\ddot{a}$, within the Szekeres model, the dipole does not contribute to the final result, hence $\ddot{a}$ only depends on a monopole configuration. Thus, the volume averaging within the Szekeres model leads to literally the same solutions as obtained within the Lemaître--Tolman model. 
0808.00377	Characterization of SL(2,q) by its non-commuting graph	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Alireza Abdollahi	Abstract:  Let $G$ be a non-abelian group and $Z(G)$ be its center. The non-commuting graph $\mathcal{A}_G$ of $G$ is the graph whose vertex set is $G\backslash Z(G)$ and two vertices are joined by an edge if they do not commute. Let $\mathrm{SL}(2,q)$ be the special linear group of degree 2 over the finite field of order $q$. In this paper we prove that if $G$ is a group such that $\mathcal{A}_G\cong \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{SL}(2,q)}$ for some prime power $q\geq 2$, then $G\cong \mathrm{SL}(2,q)$. 
0808.00378	Discrete Asymptotic Behaviors for Skew-Evolution Semiflows on Banach Spaces	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Codruta Stoica (IMB), Mihail Megan (UVT)    	Abstract:  The paper emphasizes asymptotic behaviors, as stability, instability, dichotomy and trichotomy for skew-evolution semiflows, defined by means of evolution semiflows and evolution cocycles and which can be considered generalizations for evolution operators and skew-product semiflows. The definition are given in continuous time, but the unified treatment for the characterization of the studied properties in the nonuniform case is given in discrete time. The property of trichotomy, introduced in finite dimension by S. Elaydi and O. Hajek in 1988 as a natural generalization for the dichotomy of linear time-varying differential systems, was studied by us in continuous time and from uniform point of view and in discrete time and from nonuniform point of view but for a particular case of one-parameter semiflows. 
0808.00379	Correlated electron systems periodically driven out of equilibrium: Floquet + DMFT formalism	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Naoto Tsuji, Takashi Oka, Hideo Aoki	Abstract:  We propose to combine the Floquet formalism for systems in ac fields with the dynamical mean-field theory to study correlated electron systems periodically driven out of equilibrium by external fields such as intense laser light. This approach has a virtue that we can nonperturbatively include both the correlation effects and nonlinear effects due to the driving field, which is imperative in analyzing recent experiments for photoinduced phase transitions. In solving the problem, we exploit a general theorem that the Hamiltonian in a Floquet matrix form can be exactly diagonalized for single-band noninteracting systems. As a demonstration, we have applied the method to the Falicov-Kimball model in intense ac fields to calculate the spectral function. The result shows that photoinduced midgap states emerge from strong ac fields, triggering an insulator-metal transition. 
0808.00380	Ballistic magneto-thermal transport in a Heisenberg spin chain at low temperatures	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Lifa Zhang, Jian-Sheng Wang, Baowen Li	Abstract:  We study ballistic thermal transport in Heisenberg spin chain with nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures. Explicit expressions for transmission coefficients are derived for thermal transport in a periodic spin chain of arbitrary junction length by a spin-wave model. Our analytical results agree very well with the ones from nonequilibrium Green's function method. Our study shows that the transmission coefficient oscillates with the frequency of thermal wave. Moreover, the thermal transmission shows strong dependence on the intrachain coupling, the length of the spin chain, and the external magnetic field. The results demonstrate the possibility of manipulating spin-wave propagation and magnetothermal conductance in the spin-chain junction by adjusting the intrachain coupling and/or the external magnetic field.

Configuration spaces of distinct and non-distinct n points in X away from D were constructed by the author and B. Kim in arXiv:0806.3819, by using the method of wonderful compactification. In this paper, we give an explicit presentation of Chow motives and Chow rings of these configuration spaces. 
0808.00382	Trace Formulas and a Borg-type Theorem for CMV Operators with Matrix-valued Coefficients	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Maxim Zinchenko	Abstract:  We prove a general Borg-type inverse spectral result for a reflectionless unitary CMV operator (CMV for Cantero, Moral, and Velázquez) associated with matrix-valued Verblunsky coefficients. More precisely, we find an explicit formula for the Verblunsky coefficients of a reflectionless CMV matrix whose spectrum consists of a connected arc on the unit circle. This extends a recent result on CMV operators with scalar-valued coefficients. In the course of deriving the Borg-type result we also use exponential Herglotz representations of Caratheodory matrix-valued functions to prove an infinite sequence of trace formulas connected with CMV operators. 
0808.00383	An Overview of Mixture Models	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Derek S. Young	Abstract:  This paper has been withdrawn. With the advancement of statistical theory and computing power, data sets are providing a greater amount of insight into the problems of today. Statisticians have an ever increasing number of tools to attack these problems, some of which can be implemented in the area of mixture modeling. There is a great deal of literature on mixture models and this work attempts to provide a general overview of the subject, including the discussion of relevant issues and algorithms. The reader can hope to gain a broad understanding of concepts in mixture modeling and find the references cited within as a valuable resource for the next stage of their research. 
0808.00384	Dynamics and neutrino signal of black hole formation in non-rotating failed supernovae. II. progenitor dependence	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:K. Sumiyoshi (Numazu CT), S. Yamada (Waseda Univ.), H. Suzuki (Tokyo Univ. of Science)    	Abstract:  We study the progenitor dependence of the black hole formation and its associated neutrino signals from the gravitational collapse of non-rotating massive stars, following the preceding study on the single progenitor model in Sumiyoshi et al. (2007). We aim to clarify whether the dynamical evolution toward the black hole formation occurs in the same manner for different progenitors and to examine whether the characteristic of neutrino bursts is general having the short duration and the rapidly increasing average energies. We perform the numerical simulations by general relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics to follow the dynamical evolution from the collapse of pre-supernova models of 40Msun and 50Msun toward the black hole formation via contracting proto-neutron stars. For the three progenitor models studied in this paper, we found that the black hole formation occurs in ~0.4-1.5 s after core bounce through the increase of proto-neutron star mass together with the short and energetic neutrino burst. We found that density profile of progenitor is important to determine the accretion rate onto the proto-neutron star and, therefore, the duration of neutrino burst. We compare the neutrino bursts of black hole forming events from different progenitors and discuss whether we can probe clearly the progenitor and/or the dense matter. 
0808.00385	Cluster scaling relations from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations in dark energy dominated universe	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:N. Aghanim (IAS, Orsay), A.C. da Silva (CAUP, Porto and IAS, Orsay), N.J. Nunes (DAMTP, Cambridge)    	Abstract:  Clusters are potentially powerful tools for cosmology provided their observed properties such as the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) or X-ray signals can be translated into physical quantities like mass and temperature. Scaling relations are the appropriate mean to perform this translation. It is therefore, important to understand their evolution and their modifications with respect to the physics and to the underlying cosmology. In this spirit, we investigate the effect of dark energy on the X-ray and SZ scaling relations. The study is based on the first hydro-simulations of cluster formation for diferent models of dark energy. We present results for four dark energy models which differ from each other by their equations of state parameter, $w$. Namely, we use a cosmological constant model $w=-1$ (as a reference), a perfect fluid with constant equation of state parameter $w=-0.8$ and one with $w = -1.2$ and a scalar field model (or quintessence) with varying $w$. We generate N-body/hydrodynamic simulations that include radiative cooling with the public version of the Hydra code, modified to consider an arbitrary dark energy component. We produce cluster catalogues for the four models and derive the associated X-ray and SZ scaling relations. We find that dark energy has little effect on scaling laws making it safe to use the $Λ$CDM scalings for conversion of observed quantities into temperature and masses. 
0808.00386	Lantern relations and rational blowdowns	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Hisaaki Endo, Yusuf Z. Gurtas	Abstract:  We discuss a connection between the lantern relation in mapping class groups and the rational blowing down process for 4-manifolds. More precisely, if we change a positive relator in Dehn twist generators of the mapping class group by using a lantern relation, the corresponding Lefschetz fibration changes into its rational blowdown along a copy of the configuration C_2. We exhibit examples of such rational blowdowns of Lefschetz fibrations whose blowup is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to the original fibration.

0808.00388	Partition of Networks into Basins of Attraction	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:Shai Carmi, P. L. Krapivsky, Daniel ben-Avraham	Abstract:  We study partition of networks into basins of attraction based on a steepest ascent search for the node of highest degree. Each node is associated with, or "attracted" to its neighbor of maximal degree, as long as the degree is increasing. A node that has no neighbors of higher degree is a peak, attracting all the nodes in its basin. Maximally random scale-free networks exhibit different behavior based on their degree distribution exponent $γ$: for small $γ$ (broad distribution) networks are dominated by a giant basin, whereas for large $γ$ (narrow distribution) there are numerous basins, with peaks attracting mainly their nearest neighbors. We derive expressions for the first two moments of the number of basins. We also obtain the complete distribution of basin sizes for a class of hierarchical deterministic scale-free networks that resemble random nets. Finally, we generalize the problem to regular networks and lattices where all degrees are equal, and thus the attractiveness of a node must be determined by an assigned weight, rather than the degree. We derive the complete distribution of basins of attraction resulting from randomly assigned weights in one-dimensional chains. 
0808.00389	Gravitational Radiation from Neutron Stars and Black Holes	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Carlos F. Sopuerta	Abstract:  Gravitational Wave Astronomy is becoming a reality as Earth-based interferometric gravitational-wave detectors reach the design sensitivities and move towards advanced configurations that may lead to gravitational-wave detections in the immediate future. In this contribution, I briefly summarize the basic characteristics of this new area, the discovery prospects and the potential for fundamental physics. Then, I present results of some investigations of two different sources of gravitational waves that are potential targets for present and future planned observatories. First, I will discuss the generation of gravitational radiation by non-linear effects arising from the coupling between radial and non-radial oscillations of neutron stars, which may produce distinctive gravitational-wave signatures. The gravitational radiation emitted by these sources is in the frequency band of Earth-based detectors. And second, I will discuss the gravitational-wave emission during the inspiral of extreme-mass-ratio compact binaries. In this case, the gravitational waves have low frequencies, inside the frequency band of space observatories like LISA.

Samanta, Saugata Bhattacharyya, Bambi Hu	Abstract:  We have considered the critical Casimir force on a $^4$He film below and above the bulk $λ$ point. We have explored the role of fluctuations around the mean field theory in a perturbative manner, and have substantially improved the mean field result of Zandi et al [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 76}, 030601(R) (2007)]. The Casimir scaling function obtained by us approaches a universal constant ($-\frac{ζ(3)}{8π}$) for $T\lesssim 2.13~\text{K}$. 
0808.00391	Simulation of the Lattice QCD and Technological Trends in Computation	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:K. Ibrahim, J. Jaeger, Z. Liu, L.N. Pouchet, P. Lesnicki, L. Djoudi, D.Barthou, F. Bodin, C. Eisenbeis, G. Grosdidier, O. Pene, P. Roudeau	Abstract:  Simulation of Lattice QCD is a challenging computational problem. Currently, technological trends in computation show multiple divergent models of computation. We are witnessing homogeneous multi-core architectures, the use of accelerator on-chip or off-chip, in addition to the traditional architectural models. On the verge of this technological abundance, assessing the performance trade-offs of computing nodes based on these technologies is of crucial importance to many scientific computing applications. In this study, we focus on assessing the efficiency and the performance expected for the Lattice QCD problem on representative architectures and we project the expected improvement on these architectures and their impact on performance for Lattice QCD. We additionally try to pinpoint the limiting factors for performance on these architectures. 
0808.00392	Neutrino Oscillation Results from MINOS and MiniBooNE	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Tobias M. Raufer	Abstract:  After a brief introduction to neutrino oscillations and a review of the world knowledge of neutrino oscillation parameters, we introduce two current neutrino oscillation experiments, MINOS and MiniBooNE. MINOS makes precise measurements of the oscillation parameters |Δm^{2}_{32}| and sin^{2} (2θ_{23}). MiniBooNE tests neutrino oscillations in the parameter region reported by the LSND experiment, which would require a new neutrino state. We review recent experimental results from both experiments and give an outlook on future measurements. 
0808.00393	Hard Lefschetz actions in Riemannian geometry with special holonomy	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Naichung Conan Leung, Changzheng Li	Abstract:  It is known that the hard Lefschetz action, together with Kähler identities for Kähler (resp. hyperkähler) manifolds, determines a $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)_{sup}$ (resp. $\mathfrak{sp}(1,1)_{sup}$) Lie superalgebra action on differential forms. In this paper, we explain the geometric origin of this action, and we also generalize it to manifolds with other holonomy groups. For semi-flat Calabi-Yau (resp. hyperkähler) manifolds, these symmetries can be enlarged to a $\mathfrak{so}(2,2)_{sup}$ (resp. $\mathfrak{su}(2,2)_{sup}$) action. 
0808.00394	The Magnetoplasmon spectrum of a weakly modulated two-dimensional electron gas system	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:M. Tahir, K. Sabeeh, A. MacKinnon	Abstract:  The magnetoplasmon spectrum of a magnetically modulated two-dimensional electron gas (MM2DEG) is investigated. We derive the inter and intra Landau band magnetoplasmon spectrum within the self consistent field approach. The derivation is performed at zero temperature as well as at finite temperature. Results are presented for the inter and intra Landau band magnetoplasmon spectrum as a function of the inverse magnetic field. As a result of magnetic modulation, magnetic Weiss oscillations are found to occur in the magnetoplasmon spectrum. Furthermore, our finite temperature theory facilitates analysis of effects of temperature on the magnetoplasmon spectrum. The results are compared with those obtained for an electrically modulated 2DEG system. In addition, we derive and discuss the effects of simultaneous electric and magnetic modulations on the magnetoplasmon spectrum of 2DEG when the modulations are in phase as well as when they are out of phase. Magnetic oscillations are affected by the relative phase of the two modulations and position of the oscillations depends on the relative strength of the two modulations in the former case while we find complete suppression of Weiss oscillations for particular relative strength of the modulations in the latter case. 
0808.00395	Protecting entanglement in superconducting qubits	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Jing Zhang, Yu-xi Liu, Chun-Wen Li, Tzyh-Jong Tarn, Franco Nori	Abstract:  When a two-qubit system is initially maximally-entangled, two independent decoherence channels, one per qubit, would greatly reduce the entanglement of the two-qubit system when it reaches its stationary state. We propose a method on how to minimize such a loss of entanglement in open quantum systems. We find that the quantum entanglement of general two-qubit systems with controllable parameters can be protected by tuning both the single-qubit parameters and the two-qubit coupling strengths. Indeed, the maximum fidelity $F_{\rm max}$ between the stationary entangled state, $ρ_{\infty}$, and the maximally-entangled state, $ρ_m$, can be about $2/3\approx\max\{{\rm tr}(ρ_{\infty}ρ_m)\}=F_{\rm max}$, corresponding to a maximum stationary concurrence, $C_{\rm max}$, of about $1/3\approx C(ρ_{\infty})=C_{\rm max}$. This is significant because the quantum entanglement of the two-qubit system can be protected, even for a long time. We apply our proposal to several types of two-qubit superconducting circuits, and show how the entanglement of these two-qubit circuits can be optimized by varying experimentally-controllable parameters. 
0808.00396	Coverings, composites and cables of virtual strings	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Andrew Gibson	Abstract:  A virtual string can be defined as an equivalence class of planar diagrams under certain kinds of diagrammatic moves. Virtual strings are related to virtual knots in that a simple operation on a virtual knot diagram produces a diagram for a virtual string. In this paper we consider three operations on a virtual string or virtual strings which produce another virtual string, namely covering, composition and cabling. In particular we study virtual strings unchanged by the covering operation. We also show how the based matrix of a composite virtual string is related to the based matrices of its components, correcting a result by Turaev. Finally we investigate what happens under cabling to some invariants defined by Turaev. 
0808.00397	Elementary derivation of the Lense-Thirring precession	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:O.I. Chashchina, L. Iorio, Z.K. Silagadze	Abstract:  An elementary pedagogical derivation of the Lense-Thirring precession is given based on the use of Hamilton vector. The Hamilton vector is an extra constant of motion of the Kepler/Coulomb problem related simply to the more popular Runge-Lenz vector. When a velocity-dependent Lorentz-like gravitomagnetic force is present, the Hamilton vector, as well as the canonical orbital momentum are no longer conserved and begin to precess. It is easy to calculate their precession rates, which are related to the Lense-Thirring precession of the orbit. 
0808.00398	Spectroscopy of bright quasars: emission lines and internal extinction	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:R. Bachev, A. Strigachev, E. Semkov, B. Mihov	Abstract:  The main purpose of this work is to improve the existing knowledge about the most powerful engines in the Universe - quasars. Although a lot is already known, we still have only a vague idea how these engines work exactly, why they behave as they do, and what the relation is between their evolution and the evolution of their harboring galaxy. Methods we used are based on optical spectroscopy of visually bright quasars, many of which have recently been discovered as X-ray sources, but eventually missed in color-selected surveys. The spectra typically cover the 4200-7000 AA region, allowing measurements of the characteristics of the hydrogen lines, the FeII contribution, and other lines of interest. We present accurate redshift estimates and Seyfert type classification of the objects. We also show that the contribution of the host galaxy to the optical continuum is non-negligible in many cases, as is the intrinsic AGN absorption. Consequences of not correcting for those factors when estimating different quasar parameters are discussed. We also find some evidence of a non-unity slope in the relation between the internal extinction based on the Balmer decrement and the one on the optical continuum slope, implying, if further confirmed, the intriguing possibility that some absorbing material might actually be located between the continuum source and the broad-line region. 
0808.00399	Shear Viscosity of a Non-Relativistic Conformal Gas in Two Dimensions	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Jiunn-Wei Chen, Wen-Yu Wen	Abstract:  The shear viscosity, eta, of a fermi gas with non-relativistic conformal symmetry in two spatial dimensions is investigated. We find that eta/s, s being the entropy density, diverges as a gas of free particles in this system. It is in contrast to the eta/s=1/(4 pi) found using non-relativistic AdS/CFT correspondence, which requires a strongly interacting CFT. It implies the unitary fermi gas in two spatial dimensions is not likely to have a weakly interacting gravity dual. 
0808.00400	The non-anticommutative supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:I. Jack, D.R.T. Jones, R. Purdy	Abstract:  We discuss the non-anticommutative (N=1/2) supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model in four dimensions. Firstly we introduce differential operators which implement the non-anticommutative supersymmetry algebra acting on the component fields and action. Then we perform the renormalisation of the model up to two-loop order, including the complete set of terms necessary for renormalisability. We show that (at least up to this order) the results obtained when we eliminate the auxiliary field after renormalisation are equivalent to those obtained when we eliminate the auxiliary fields before quantisation. 
0808.00401	Quality factor due to roughness scattering of shear horizontal surface acoustic waves in nanoresonators	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:G. Palasantzas	Abstract:  In this work we study the quality factor associated with dissipation due to scattering of shear horizontal surface acoustic waves by random self-affine roughness. It is shown the quality factor is strongly influenced by both the surface roughness exponent H, and the roughness amplitude w to lateral correlation length X ratio. Indeed, quality factors for roughness exponents H>0.5 are comparable to quality factors due to intrinsic dissipation mechanisms (e.g., thermoelastic losses and phonon-phonon scattering) especially for wave vectors <1/X. Our results indicate that this dissipation mechanism should be carefully considered in the design micro/nanoelectromechanical systems. 
0808.00402	Space versus Time: Unimodular versus Non-Unimodular Projective Ring Geometries?	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Metod Saniga (ASTRINSTSAV), Petr Pracna (JH-Inst)    	Abstract:  Finite projective (lattice) geometries defined over rings instead of fields have recently been recognized to be of great importance for quantum information theory. We believe that there is much more potential hidden in these geometries to be unleashed for physics. There exist specific rings over which the projective spaces feature two principally distinct kinds of basic constituents (points and/or higher-rank linear subspaces), intricately interwoven with each other -- unimodular and non-unimodular. We conjecture that these two projective "degrees of freedom" can rudimentary be associated with spatial and temporal dimensions of physics, respectively. Our hypothesis is illustrated on the projective line over the smallest ring of ternions. Both the fundamental difference and intricate connection between time and space are demonstrated, and even the ring geometrical germs of the observed macroscopic dimensionality (3+1) of space-time and the arrow of time are outlined. Some other conceptual implications of this speculative model (like a hierarchical structure of physical systems) are also mentioned. 
0808.00403	Helical magnetorotational instability of Taylor-Couette flows in the Rayleigh limit and for quasi-Kepler rotation	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Guenther Ruediger, Manfred Schultz	Abstract:  The magnetorotational instability (MRI) of differential rotation under the simultaneous presence of axial and azimuthal components of the (current-free) magnetic field is considered. For rotation with uniform specific angular momentum the MHD equations for axisymmetric perturbations are solved in a local short-wave approximation. All the solutions are overstable for B_z \cdot B_φ \neq 0 with eigenfrequencies approaching the viscous frequency. For more flat rotation laws the results of the local approximation do not comply with the results of a global calculation of the MHD instability of Taylor-Couette flows between rotating cylinders. -- With B_phi and B_z of the same order the traveling-mode solutions are also prefered for flat rotation laws such as the quasi-Kepler rotation. For magnetic Prandtl number Pm\to 0 they scale with the Reynolds number of rotation rather than with the magnetic Reynolds number (as for standard MRI) so that they can easily be realized in MHD laboratory experiments. -- Regarding the nonaxisymmetric modes one finds a remarkable influence of the ratio B_φ/B_z only for the extrema. For B_φ>> B_z and for not too small Pm the nonaxisymmetric modes dominate the traveling axisymmetric modes. For standard MRI with B_z >> B_φ, however, the critical Reynolds numbers of the nonaxisymmetric modes exceed the values for the axisymmetric modes by many orders so that they are never prefered. 
0808.00404	Varying Gravitational Constant as Well as Cosmology from the Early Inflation to Late Acceleration and Future Universe	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:S.K.Srivastava	Abstract:  Here, cosmology is obtained from the variable gravitational constant $ G \propto φ^{-2}$ with $ φ(x) $ being a scalar and its fluctuations around the ground state. The gravitational action contains Einstein-Hilbert like term with variable $ G $, kinetic energy and self-interaction potential for $ φ(x) $. Two phase transitions take place in this model. The first one takes place at the GUT (grand unified theory) scale $ \sim 2.45 \times 10^{14}{\rm GeV} $, when the early universe exits the inflationay phase and the second one at the electro-weak scale. Spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place around this scale As a consequence, variable $ G $ acquires constant value $G_N$ (the Newtonian gravitational constant).The standard model of cosmology is obtained in the post-second phase transition era. Interestingly, the dark matter and quintessence dark energy are created from the gravitational sector as a combined effect of the linear term of scalar curvature and $ φ(x) $ without using non-linear terms of curvature or any other matter fields. It is interesting to find that fluctuations in $ φ(x) $ cause the phantom dark energy after the second phase transition, which grows later in the expanding universe. It is also found that the phantom era is free from big-rip singularity. 
0808.00405	An Exactly Solvable Supersymmetric Model of Semimagic Nuclei	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:A. B. Balantekin, N. Guven, Y. Pehlivan	Abstract:  A simple model of nucleons coupled to angular momentum zero (s-pairs) occupying the valance shell of a semi-magic nuclei is considered. The model has a separable, orbit dependent pairing interaction which dominates over the kinetic term. It is shown that such an interaction leads to an exactly solvable model whose (0+) eigenstates and energies can be computed very easily with the help of the algebraic Bethe ansatz method. It is also shown that the model has a supersymmetry which connects the spectra of some semimagic nuclei. The results obtained from this model for the semimagic Ni isotopes from 58Ni to 68Ni are given. In addition, a new and easier technique for calculating the energy eigenvalues from the Bethe ansatz equations is also presented. 
0808.00406	Effect of the shape of periodic forces and second periodic forces on horseshoe chaos in Duffing oscillator	Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)	Authors:V. Ravichandran, V. Chinnathambi, S. Rajasekar, Choy Heng Lai	Abstract:  The effect of the shape of six different periodic forces and second periodic forces on the onset of horseshoe chaos are studied both analytically and numerically in a Duffing oscillator. The external periodic forces considered are sine wave, square wave, symmetric saw-tooth wave, asymmetric saw-tooth wave, rectified sine wave, and modulus of sine wave. An analytical threshold condition for the onset of horseshoe chaos is obtained in the Duffing oscillator driven by various periodic forces using the Melnikov method. Melnikov threshold curve is drawn in a parameter space. For all the forces except modulus of sine wave, the onset of cross-well asymptotic chaos is observed just above the Melnikov threshold curve for onset of horseshoe chaos. For the modulus of sine wave long time transient motion followed by a periodic attractor is realized. The possibility of controlling of horseshoe and asymptotic chaos in the Duffing oscillator by an addition of second periodic force is then analyzed. Parametric regimes where suppression of horseshoe chaos occurs are predicted. Analytical prediction is demonstrated through direct numerical simulations. Starting from asymptotic chaos we show the recovery of periodic motion for a range of values of amplitude and phase of the second periodic force. Interestingly, suppression of chaos is found in the parametric regimes where the Melnikov function does not change sign. 
0808.00407	Non-commutative Castelnuovo-Mumford Regularity and AS-regular Algebras	Quantum Algebra (math.QA)	Authors:Z.-C. Dong, Q.-S. Wu	Abstract:  Let $A$ be a connected graded $k$-algebra with a balanced dualizing complex. We prove that $A$ is a Koszul AS-regular algebra if and only if that the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and the Ext-regularity coincide for all finitely generated $A$-modules. This can be viewed as a non-commutative version of \cite[Theorem 1.3]{ro}. By using Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, we prove that any Koszul standard AS-Gorenstein algebra is AS-regular. As a preparation to prove the main result, we also prove the following statements are equivalent: (1) $A$ is AS-Gorenstein; (2) $A$ has finite left injective dimension; (3) the dualizing complex has finite left projective dimension. This generalizes \cite[Corollary 5.9]{mori}. 
0808.00408	Edge effects in the two-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Kaj H. Hoglund, Anders W. Sandvik	Abstract:  We use quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study effects of free edges in the two-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet. We find that the magnetic response of an edge is smaller than the bulk susceptibility. This counter-intuitive quantum effect can be traced to enhanced antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor spin correlations, i.e., tendency to local singlet formation, at and close to the edge. These correlations form a comb-like pattern, which can be reproduced with a simple variational valence-bond state. We also study rough edges, and find that these instead significantly enhance the susceptibility, due to local sublattice imbalance impeding singlet formation. 
0808.00409	DC Josephson Effect with Fermi gases in the Bose-Einstein regime	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:F. Ancilotto, L. Salasnich, F. Toigo	Abstract:  We show that the DC Josephson effect with ultracold fermionic gases in the BEC regime of composite molecules can be described by a nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE). By comparing our results with Bogoliubov-de Gennes calculations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 040401 (2007)] we find that our superfluid NLSE, which generalizes the Gross-Pitaevskii equation taking into account the correct equation of state, is reliable in the BEC regime of the BCS-BEC crossover up to the limit of very large (positive) scattering length. We also predict that the Josephson current displays relevant beyond mean-field effects. 
0808.00410	Vacca-type series for values of the generalized-Euler-constant function and its derivative	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Khodabakhsh Hessami Pilehrood, Tatiana Hessami Pilehrood	Abstract:  We generalize well-known Catalan-type integrals for Euler's constant to values of the generalized-Euler-constant function and its derivatives. Using generating functions appeared in these integral representations we give new Vacca and Ramanujan-type series for values of the generalized-Euler-constant function and Addison-type series for values of the generalized-Euler-constant function and its derivative. As a consequence, we get base $B$ rational series for $\log\frac{4}π,$ $\frac{G}π$ (where $G$ is Catalan's constant), $\frac{ζ'(2)}{π^2}$ and also for logarithms of Somos's and Glaisher-Kinkelin's constants. 
0808.00411	Hydrodynamics of N=6 Superconformal Chern-Simons Theories at Strong Coupling	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Mohammad R. Garousi, Ahmad Ghodsi	Abstract:  Using the duality conjecture between N=6 supersymmetric U(N)_k \times U(N)_{-k} Chern-Simons theory and M-theory on AdS_4 \times S^7/Z_{k}, we calculate the corrections to the shear viscosity of the field theory at temperature T. At strong 't Hooft coupling and at small k level, we have considered one-loop correction to the M-theory effective action. At large k level, we have considered the alpha' correction to the type IIA effective action. In both cases the correction to the ratio of shear viscosity to the entropy density is positive. 
0808.00412	A modified lookdown construction for the Xi-Fleming-Viot process with mutation and populations with recurrent bottlenecks	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Matthias Birkner, Jochen Blath, Martin Moehle, Matthias Steinruecken, Johanna Tams	Abstract:  Let $Λ$ be a finite measure on the unit interval. A $Λ$-Fleming-Viot process is a probability measure valued Markov process which is dual to a coalescent with multiple collisions ($Λ$-coalescent) in analogy to the duality known for the classical Fleming Viot process and Kingman's coalescent, where $Λ$ is the Dirac measure in 0. We explicitly construct a dual process of the coalescent with simultaneous multiple collisions ($Ξ$-coalescent) with mutation, the $Ξ$-Fleming-Viot process with mutation, and provide a representation based on the empirical measure of an exchangeable particle system along the lines of Donnelly and Kurtz (1999). We establish pathwise convergence of the approximating systems to the limiting $Ξ$-Fleming-Viot process with mutation. An alternative construction of the semigroup based on the Hille-Yosida theorem is provided and various types of duality of the processes are discussed. In the last part of the paper a population is considered which undergoes recurrent bottlenecks. In this scenario, non-trivial $Ξ$-Fleming-Viot processes naturally arise as limiting models. 
0808.00413	Determination of gluon polarization from deep inelastic scattering and collider data	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:M. Hirai, S. Kumano, Asymmetry Analysis Collaboration	Abstract:  We investigate impact of $π^0$-production data at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and future E07-011 experiment for the structure function $g_1$ of the deuteron at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) on studies of nucleonic spin structure, especially on the polarized gluon distribution function. By global analyses of polarized lepton-nucleon scattering and the $π^0$-production data, polarized parton distribution functions are determined and their uncertainties are estimated by the Hessian method. Two types of the gluon distribution function are investigated. One is a positive distribution and the other is a node-type distribution which changes sign at $x \sim 0.1$. Although the RHIC $π^0$ data seem to favor the node type for $Δg(x)$, it is difficult to determine a precise functional form from the current data. However, it is interesting to find that the gluon distribution $Δg(x)$ is positive at large $x$ ($>0.2$) due to constraints from the scaling violation in $g_1$ and RHIC $π^0$ data. The JLab-E07-011 measurements for $g_1^d$ should be also able to reduce the gluon uncertainty, and the reduction is comparable to the one by RUN-5 $π^0$-production data at RHIC. The reduction is caused by the error correlation between polarized antiquark and gluon distributions and by a next-to-leading-order (NLO) gluonic effect in the structure function $g_1^d$. We find that the JLab-E07-011 data are accurate enough to probe the NLO gluonic term in $g_1$. Both RHIC and JLab data contribute to better determination of the polarized gluon distribution in addition to improvement on polarized quark and antiquark distributions.

0808.00415	Gromov Compactness in Hoelder Spaces and Minimal Connections on Jet Bundles	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Viktor Fromm	Abstract:  The goal of this work is to establish a proof of the Gromov convergence in Hoelder spaces for curves with a totally real boundary condition following the original geometric idea of Gromov. We use a local reflection principle in neighbourhoods of the totally real submanifold as developed by Ivashkovich and Shevchishin and existence results for special connections on spaces of jet bundles to obtain higher regularity and Gromov-Schwarz estimates along the boundary. 
0808.00416	Refined Analytic Torsion on Manifolds with Boundary	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Boris Vertman	Abstract:  The refined analytic torsion, defined by M. Braverman and T. Kappeler on closed manifolds, can be viewed as a refinement of the Ray-Singer torsion, since it is a canonical choice of an element with Ray-Singer norm one, in case of unitary representations. The complex phase of the refinement is given by the rho-invariant of the odd-signature operator. Unfortunately there seems to be no canonical way to extend the construction of Braverman and Kappeler to compact manifolds with boundary. In particular a gluing formula seems to be out of reach. We propose a different refinement of analytic torsion, similar to Braverman and Kappeler, which does apply to compact manifolds with and without boundary. In a subsequent publication we establish a gluing formula for our construction, which in fact can also be viewed as a gluing law for the original definition of refined analytic torsion by Braverman and Kappeler.

Ram Murty, Kotyada Srinivas	Abstract:  For an odd positive integer $n\ge 5$, assuming the truth of the $abc$ conjecture, we show that for a positive proportion of pairs $(a,b)$ of integers the trinomials of the form $t^n+at+b (a,b\in \mathbb Z)$ are irreducible and their discriminants are squarefree. 
0808.00419	Crystallization of Beta-phase Poly (vinylidene fluoride) films using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent and at suitable annealing condition	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:S. Satapathy, P. K. Gupta, Santosh Pawar, K. B. R. Varma	Abstract:  In literature it has been reported that the gamma-phase PVDF film is formed from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvents regardless of preparation temperature. In this report the crystallization of both alpha and gamma phase from DMSO solvent by varying preparation temperature has been described. This paper also describes the conversion of gamma-phase to beta- phase and alpha-phase at different annealing condition. When thin films were annealed at 90C for 5 hours, then maximum beta-phase content (greater than 95%) is present in PVDF thin film. The PVDF films completely converted to alpha-phase, when they were annealed at 160C for 5 hours. From (X-ray diffraction) XRD, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrum (FTIR), (Differential thermal analysis) DTA and Raman studies, it is confirmed that the PVDF thin films, cast from DMSO solution and annealed at 90C for 5 hours, have maximum percentage of beta-phase(greater than 95%). 
0808.00420	Study on dielectric behavior of Lithium Tantalate(LT) nano particle filled poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nano composite	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:S. Satapathy, P. K. Gupta, K. B. R. Varma, Pragya Tiwari, V. Ganeshan	Abstract:  For pyroelectric detector application materials should have low dielectric constant, high pyroelectric coefficient, large non volatile polarization at small applied electric field and low specific heat. Large field (greater than 1200kV/cm) is need to pole ferroelectric polymer poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and it has low sensitivity compared to other pyroelectric materials. To increase non volatile polarization at low poling field and to increase pyroelectric coefficient, LiTaO3 (LT) nano particles were added to PVDF matrix to make LT/PVDF composite. It is important to study the dielectric properties of the composite (to be used in detector application) because dielectric constant varies with volume fraction of filler and with frequency. Nano composite films of LT/PVDF with different volume fraction (i. e fLT = 0.047, 0.09 and 0.17) of LT were prepared by dispersing LT nano particles in solution of PVDF. The dielectric properties of LT/PVDF composite were studied by varying the volume fraction of LT. The dielectric permittivity of LT/ PVDF composites increased compared to PVDF as the volume fraction of LT increases but the loss tangent is almost constant at higher frequency. In low frequency region, for fLT = 0.17 the dielectric permittivity of composite is greater than PVDF and LT. The dielectric loss tangent is also increased from 0.04 to 0.175 as fLT increases from 0 to 0.17 at 1 kHz. The dielectric permittivity behavior of composite has been explained using percolation model and space charge polarization model.

It is shown, that at presence of spin-phonon interaction phonon possess circular polari-zation which causes the appearance of heat flux component perpendicular both to temperature gradient and magnetic field. 
0808.00422	Variations of the solar granulation motions with height using the GOLF/SoHO experiment	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Lefebvre, R.A. Garcia, S.J. Jimenez-Reyes, S. Turck-Chieze, S. Mathur	Abstract:  Below 1 mHz, the power spectrum of helioseismic velocity measurements is dominated by the spectrum of convective motions (granulation and supergranulation) making it difficult to detect the low-order acoustic modes and the gravity modes. We want to better understand the behavior of solar granulation as a function of the observing height in the solar atmosphere and with magnetic activity during solar cycle 23. We analyze the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of eleven years of GOLF/SOHO velocity-time series using a Harvey-type model to characterize the properties of the convective motions in the solar oscillation power spectrum. We study then the evolution of the granulation with the altitude in the solar atmosphere and with the solar activity. First, we show that the traditional use of a lorentzian profile to fit the envelope of the p modes is not well suitable for GOLF data. Indeed, to properly model the solar spectrum, we need a second lorentzian profile. Second, we show that the granulation clearly evolves with the height in the photosphere but does not present any significant variation with the activity cycle. 
0808.00423	Enhancement of nonvolatile polarization and pyroelectric sensitivity in Lithium tantalate (LT)/ Poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) nano composite	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:S. Satapathy, P. K. Gupta, K. B. R. Varma	Abstract:  For pyroelectric sensor application, materials having large ferroelectric polarization at low applied field and high pyroelectric sensitivity are required. PVDF is one of the ferroelectric polymers, which is being used for pyroelectric detector application. Following properties of PVDF such as low density, low acoustic impedance, wide bandwidth, flexibility, toughness, and ease of fabrication into complex patterns and arrays make it suitable for large area detector applications. But the PVDF has low value of pyroelectric coefficient (p). High field (above 1200kV/cm) is required to pole the PVDF film. To reduce poling field and to get high value of ferroelectric polarization at low poling field, nano composite films of LT/PVDF have been prepared. Since LT is ferroelectric (max. poling field ~ 200kV/cm and (p) ~ 2.3 * 10-8 C cm-2/ K) in nature, the nonvolatile polarization of composite increased from 0.014microC/cm2 to 2.06microC/cm2 at an applied field of 150kV/cm as the volume fraction of LT (fLT) nano particle increases from 0.0 to 0.17. Similarly the increase of fLT from 0.0 to 0.17 results in increase of pyroelectric voltage sensitivity from 3.93 V/J to 18.5V/J. 
0808.00424	Primordial non-Gaussianity estimator: the inhomogeneous noise effect	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:B. Yu, T. Lu	Abstract:  Since the inhomogeneous instrument noise can produce extra non-Gaussianity in the CMB anisotropy, its effect should be carefully subtracted in the primordial non-Gaussianity estimation. We calculate the probability distribution function of the CMB anisotropy for local type of non-Gaussianity, from which the optimal estimator in the general case (inhomogeneous noise and cut sky) is obtained. The new estimator obtained here is different from the popular one, since the inhomogeneous noise and cut sky effects are completely accounted. The CMB anisotropy in the new estimator is noise weighted. The noise weight is different from that used by WMAP Group in their 5-year data analysis. Although it is still difficult to calculate the new estimator rigorously, for the case of the slightly inhomogeneous noise, there exists a series expansion method to compute the new estimator. Each order in the series is suppressed by two factors, $(\frac{σ^2}{σ^2_{i}}-1)$ and $\frac{C_l}{C^{tot}_{l}}$, which make the method feasible. Through the Edgeworth expansion we can generalize our discussion to other types of non-Gaussianity.

We obtain the strong laws for the counts of balls corresponding to each color. The scalings for these laws depend on the diagonal elements of a rearranged replacement matrix. We use the strong laws obtained to study further behavior of certain three color urn models.

0808.00428	On the geometry of the f-invariant	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Hanno von Bodecker	Abstract:  The f-invariant is a higher version of the e-invariant that takes values in the divided congruences between modular forms; it can be formulated as an elliptic genus of manifolds with corners of codimension two. In this thesis, we develop a geometrical interpretation of the f-invariant in terms of index theory, thereby providing an analytical link between the stable homotopy groups of the spheres and the arithmetic of modular forms. In particular, we are able to establish a formula that allows us to compute the f-invariant from a single face. Furthermore, we apply our results to the situation of cartesian products and principal circle bundles, performing explicit calculations.

Ryckebusch (1), B. C. Metsch (2) ((1) Ghent University, Belgium, (2) HISKP, Bonn University, Germany)    	Abstract:  The isoscalar twist-two generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the pion and the kaon are calculated in a Poincare covariant Bethe-Salpeter constituent quark model. Results are presented for several values of the parameters xi and t. The results satisfy the form factor constraints and the polynomiality condition. For the pion GPD, also the isospin symmetry constraint is fulfilled. The influence of kinematical variables and model parameters on the support of the GPDs is investigated. To this end, the strength parameters and quark masses of the constituent quark model are artificially varied.

We show that it describes the motion of the particle on (N-2)-dimensional sphere interacting with N(N-1)/2 force centers with Higgs oscillator potential. In the case of four-particle system these force centers define the vertexes of an Archimedean solid called cuboctahedron. 
0808.00431	Maximally homogeneous para-CR manifolds of semisimple type	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Dmitri V. Alekseevsky, Costantino Medori, Adriano Tomassini	Abstract:  An almost para-CR structure on a manifold $M$ is given by a distribution $HM \subset TM$ together with a field $K \in Γ({\rm End}(HM))$ of involutive endomorphisms of $HM$. If $K$ satisfies an integrability condition, then $(HM,K)$ is called a para-CR structure. The notion of maximally homogeneous para-CR structure of a semisimple type is given. A classification of such maximally homogeneous para-CR structures is given in terms of appropriate gradations of real semisimple Lie algebras. 
0808.00432	Structure of characteristic Lyapunov vectors in spatiotemporal chaos	Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)	Authors:Diego Pazó, Ivan G. Szendro, Juan M. López, Miguel A. Rodríguez	Abstract:  We study Lyapunov vectors (LVs) corresponding to the largest Lyapunov exponents in systems with spatiotemporal chaos. We focus on characteristic LVs and compare the results with backward LVs obtained via successive Gram-Schmidt orthonormalizations. Systems of a very different nature such as coupled-map lattices and the (continuous-time) Lorenz `96 model exhibit the same features in quantitative and qualitative terms. Additionally we propose a minimal stochastic model that reproduces the results for chaotic systems. Our work supports the claims about universality of our earlier results [I. G. Szendro et al., Phys. Rev. E 76, 025202(R) (2007)] for a specific coupled-map lattice. 
0808.00433	Superconductivity in the 2D Hubbard model: Electron doping is different	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:D. Eichenberger, D. Baeriswyl	Abstract:  A variational Monte Carlo calculation is used for studying the ground state of the two-dimensional Hubbard model, including hopping between both nearest and next-nearest neighbor sites. Superconductivity with d-wave symmetry is found to be restricted to densities where the Fermi surface crosses the magnetic zone boundary. The condensate energy is much larger for hole doping than for electron doping. Superconductivity is kinetic energy driven for hole doping, but potential energy driven for electron doping. Our findings agree surprisingly well with experimental data for layered cuprates, both for electron- and hole-doped materials. 
0808.00434	Evidence for the Sr2RuO4 intercalations in the Sr3Ru2O7 region of the Sr3Ru2O7-Sr2RuO4 eutectic system	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:S. Kittaka, S. Yonezawa, H. Yaguchi, Y. Maeno, R. Fittipaldi, A. Vecchione, J. -F. Mercure, A. Gibbs, R. S. Perry, A. P. Mackenzie	Abstract:  Although Sr3Ru2O7 has not been reported to exhibit superconductivity so far, ac susceptibility measurements revealed multiple superconducting transitions occurring in the Sr3Ru2O7 region cut from Sr3Ru2O7-Sr2RuO4 eutectic crystals. Based on various experimental results, some of us proposed the scenario in which Sr2RuO4 thin slabs with a few layers of the RuO2 plane are embedded in the Sr3Ru2O7 region as stacking faults and multiple superconducting transitions arise from the distribution of the slab thickness. To examine this scenario, we measured the resistivity along the ab plane (rho_ab) using a Sr3Ru2O7-region sample cut from the eutectic crystal, as well as along the c axis (rho_c) using the same crystal. As a result, we detected resistance drops associated with superconductivity only in rho_ab, but not in rho_c. These results support the Sr2RuO4 thin-slab scenario. In addition, we measured the resistivity of a single crystal of pure Sr3Ru2O7 with very high quality and found that pure Sr3Ru2O7 does not exhibit superconductivity down to 15 mK. 
0808.00435	Masses of Black Holes in the Universe	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Janusz Ziolkowski (Copernicus Astronomical Center, Warsaw, Poland)    	Abstract:  The different methods of determination of black holes (BHs) masses are presented for three classes of BHs observed in the Universe: stellar mass BHs, intermediate mass BHs (IMBHs) and supermassive BHs (SBHs). The results of these determinations are briefly reviewed: stellar mass BHs are found in the range of about 3 to about 20 solar masses, IMBHs in the range of a few hundreds to a few tens of thousands solar masses (the determinations are much less precise for these objects) and SBHs in the range of about 3x10^5 to about 6x10^10 solar masses. 
0808.00436	Smoothings of schemes with non-isolated singularities	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Nikolaos Tziolas	Abstract:  In this paper we study the deformation and Q-Gorenstein deformation theory of schemes with non-isolated singularities. We obtain obstruction spaces for the existence of deformations and also for local deformations to exist globally. Finally we obtain explicit criteria in order for a pure and reduced scheme of finite type over a field $k$ to have smoothings and Q-Gorenstein smoothings. 
0808.00437	The Einstein formula: E_0=mc^2 "Isn't the Lord laughing?"	History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)	Authors:L.B. Okun	Abstract:  The article traces the way Einstein formulated the relation between energy and mass in his work from 1905 to 1955. Einstein emphasized quite often that the mass $m$ of a body is equivalent to its rest energy $E_0$. At the same time he frequently resorted to the less clear-cut statement of equivalence of energy and mass. As a result, Einstein's formula $E_0=mc^2$ still remains much less known than its popular form, $E=mc^2$, in which $E$ is the total energy equal to the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy of a freely moving body. One of the consequences of this is the widespread fallacy that the mass of a body increases when its velocity increases and even that this is an experimental fact. As wrote the playwright A N Ostrovsky "Something must exist for people, something so austere, so lofty, so sacrosanct that it would make profaning it unthinkable." 
0808.00438	Using Tau Polarization for Charged Higgs Boson and SUSY Searches at LHC	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Monoranjan Guchait, D.P.Roy	Abstract:  The $τ$ polarization can be easily measured at LHC in the 1-prong hadronic $τ$ decay channel by measuring what fraction of the $τ$-jet momentum is carried by the charged track. A simple cut requiring this fraction to be >0.8 retains most of the polarization of $τ=$+1 $τ$-jet signal while suppressing the polarization of $τ=$-1 $τ$-jet background and practically eliminating the fake $τ$ background. This can be utilized to extract the charged Higgs signal. It can be also utilized to extract the SUSY signal in the stau NLSP region, and in particular the stau co-annihilaton region. 
0808.00439	Collective Excitations of Rotating Dipolar Fermi Gases in the Fractional Quantum Hall Regime	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Szu-Cheng Cheng	Abstract:  We apply the magneto-roton theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect to study the collective excitation spectrum of rotating dipolar Fermi gases. The predicted spectrum has a finite energy gap in the long wavelength limit and a roton minimum at finite wave vector. The roton minimum being deepened from filling factor 1/3 to filling factor 1/5 is a signature of incipient crystallization near filling factor 1/7. We also demonstrate that there are no low-lying single-particle excitations below the roton mode. The fractional-quantum-Hall fluid rotating dipolar fermions behaves as an incompressible superfluid at low temperature. 
0808.00440	Spinors and Theta Deformations	Quantum Algebra (math.QA)	Authors:Ludwik Dabrowski	Abstract:  The construction due to Connes and Landi of Dirac operators on theta-deformed manifolds is recalled, stressing the aspect of spin structure. The description of Connes and Dubois-Violette is extended to arbitrary spin structure. 
0808.00441	Exhaustible sets in higher-type computation	Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)	Authors:Martin Escardo	Abstract:  We say that a set is exhaustible if it admits algorithmic universal quantification for continuous predicates in finite time, and searchable if there is an algorithm that, given any continuous predicate, either selects an element for which the predicate holds or else tells there is no example. The Cantor space of infinite sequences of binary digits is known to be searchable. Searchable sets are exhaustible, and we show that the converse also holds for sets of hereditarily total elements in the hierarchy of continuous functionals; moreover, a selection functional can be constructed uniformly from a quantification functional. We prove that searchable sets are closed under intersections with decidable sets, and under the formation of computable images and of finite and countably infinite products. This is related to the fact, established here, that exhaustible sets are topologically compact. We obtain a complete description of exhaustible total sets by developing a computational version of a topological Arzela--Ascoli type characterization of compact subsets of function spaces. We also show that, in the non-empty case, they are precisely the computable images of the Cantor space. The emphasis of this paper is on the theory of exhaustible and searchable sets, but we also briefly sketch applications. 
0808.00442	Transient dynamics of the Anderson impurity model out of equilibrium	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:T. L. Schmidt, P. Werner, L. Muehlbacher, A. Komnik	Abstract:  We discuss the transient effects in the Anderson impurity model that occur when two fermionic continua with finite bandwidths are instantaneously coupled to a central level. We present results for the analytically solvable noninteracting resonant level system first and then consistently extend them to the interacting case using the conventional perturbation theory and recently developed nonequilibrium Monte Carlo simulation schemes. The main goal is to gain an understanding of the full time-dependent nonlinear current-voltage characteristics and the population probability of the central level. We find that, contrary to the steady state, the transient dynamics of the system depends sensitively on the bandwidth of the electrode material. 
0808.00443	Functional Determinants for Regular-Singular Laplace-type Operators	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Boris Vertman	Abstract:  We discuss a specific class of regular-singular Laplace-type operators with matrix coefficients. Their zeta determinants were studied by K. Kirsten, P. Loya and J. Park on the basis of the Contour integral method, with general boundary conditions at the singularity and Dirichlet boundary conditions at the regular boundary. We complete the arguments of Kirsten, Loya and Park by explicitly verifying that the Contour integral method indeed applies in the regular-singular setup. Further we extend the zeta determinant computations to generalized Neumann boundary conditions at the regular boundary and apply our results to Laplacians on a bounded generalized cone with relative ideal boundary conditions. 
0808.00444	Electromagnetic form factors of hadrons in the time-like region	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:O.D. Dalkarov, P.A. Khakhulin, A.Yu. Voronin	Abstract:  Hadron electromagnetic form factors of hadrons in the time-like region at the boundary of the physical region is considered. The energy behaviour of the form factor is shown to be dominantely determined by the strong hadron-antihadron interaction. The scattering length imaginary part for $p-\bar{p}$, $Λ-\barΛ$, $Σ^0-\bar{Σ^0}$ are evaluated. We propose experiments to extract the information on the nearthreshold baryon-antibaryon interaction by using of hadron form foctors. 
0808.00445	Antiferromagnetism versus Kondo screening in the two-dimensional periodic Anderson model at half filling: Variational cluster approach	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:S. Horiuchi, S. Kudo, T. Shirakawa, Y. Ohta	Abstract:  The variational cluster approach (VCA) based on the self-energy functional theory is applied to the two-dimensional symmetric periodic Anderson model at half filling. We calculate a variety of physical quantities including the staggered moments and single-particle spectra at zero temperature to show that the symmetry breaking due to antiferromagnetic ordering occurs in the strong coupling region, whereas in the weak coupling region, the Kondo insulating state without symmetry breaking is realized. The critical interaction strength is estimated. We thus demonstrate that the phase transition due to competition between antiferromagnetism and Kondo screening in the model can be described quantitatively by VCA. 
0808.00446	Search for scalar leptoquarks and T-odd quarks in the acoplanar jet topology using 2.5 fb-1 of ppbar collision data at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:D0 Collaboration: V. Abazov, et al    	Abstract:  A search for new physics in the acoplanar jet topology has been performed in 2.5 fb-1 of data from ppbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV, recorded by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The numbers of events with exactly two acoplanar jets and missing transverse energy are in good agreement with the standard model expectations. The result of this search has been used to set a lower mass limit of 205 GeV at the 95% C.L. on the mass of a scalar leptoquark when this particle decays exclusively into a quark and a neutrino. In the framework of the Little Higgs model with T-parity, limits have also been obtained on the T-odd quark mass as a function of the T-odd photon mass. 
0808.00447	Sensing Shallow Seafloor and Sediment Properties, Recent History	Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)	Authors:Michael M. Harris, William E. Avera, Andrei Abelev, Frank W. Bentrem, L. Dale Bibee	Abstract:  Near surface seafloor properties are needed for recreational, commercial, and military applications. Construction projects on the ocean seafloors often require extensive knowledge about strength, deformability, hydraulic, thermal, acoustic, and seismic characteristics for locating stable environments and ensuring proper functioning of structures, pipelines, and other installations on the surface of and buried into the marine sediments. The military is also interested in a variety of seafloor properties as they impact sound propagation, mine impact burial, trafficability, bearing capacity, time-dependent settlement, and stability of objects on the seafloor. Point measurements of sediment properties are done using core samplers and sediment grab devices (with subsequent lab analysis) and in-situ probes. These techniques are expensive in terms of ship time and provide limited area coverage. Sub-bottom acoustic and electromagnetic sensors can provide profiles of near surface sediment information with improved coverage rates. Fusion techniques are being developed to provide areal extent of sediment information from multiple sensors. This paper examines the recent history of techniques used to measure sediment properties in the upper portions of the seafloor and in shallow (<100m) water. 
0808.00448	Ion induced segregation in gold nanostructured thin films on silicon	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:J. Ghatak, P. V. Satyam (Institute of Physics, Sachivalaya Marg, Bhubaneswar, India)    	Abstract:  We report a direct observation of segregation of gold atoms to the near surface regime due to 1.5 MeV Au2+ ion impact on isolated gold nanostructures deposited on silicon. Irradiation at fluences of 6x10^13, 1x10^14 and 5x10^14 ions cm-2 at a high beam flux of 6.3x1012 ions cm-2 s-1 show a maximum transported distance of gold atoms into the silicon substrate to be 60, 45 and 23 nm, respectively. At a lower fluence (6x1013 ions cm-2) transport has been found to be associated with the formation of gold silicide (Au5Si2). At a high fluence value of 5x10^14 ions cm-2, disassociation of gold silicide and out-diffusion lead to segregation of gold to defect - rich surface and interface region. 
0808.00449	Analytic Torsion of a Bounded Generalized Cone	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Boris Vertman	Abstract:  Torsion invariants for manifolds which are not simply connected were introduced by K. Reidemeister and generalized to higher dimensions by W. Franz. The Reidemeister torsion, was the first invariant of manifolds which was not a homotopy invariant. The analytic counterpart of the combinatorial Reidemeister torsion was introduced by D. B. Ray and I. M. Singer in form of a weighted product of zeta-regularized determinants of Laplace operators on differential forms. The celebrated Cheeger-Mueller Theorem, established independently by J. Cheeger and W. Mueller, proved equality between the analytic Ray-Singer torsion and the combinatorial Reidemeister torsion for any smooth closed manifold with an orthogonal representation of its fundamental group. Motivated by the vision of a Cheeger-Mueller type result on manifolds with conical singularities, we compute the analytic torsion of a bounded generalized cone by generalizing the computational methods of M. Spreafico and using the symmetry of the de Rham complex, as established by M. Lesch. 
0808.00450	Effective Perrin theory for the anisotropic diffusion of a strongly hindered rod	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Tobias Munk, Felix Höfling, Erwin Frey, Thomas Franosch	Abstract:  Slender rods in concentrated suspensions constitute strongly interacting systems with rich dynamics: transport slows down drastically and the anisotropy of the motion becomes arbitrarily large. We develop a mesoscopic description of the dynamics down to the length scale of the interparticle distance. Our theory is based on the exact solution of the Smoluchowski-Perrin equation; it is in quantitative agreement with extensive Brownian dynamics simulations in the dense regime. In particular, we show that the tube confinement is characterised by a power law decay of the intermediate scattering function with exponent 1/2. 
0808.00451	Gluing Formula for Refined Analytic Torsion	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Boris Vertman	Abstract:  In the previous article "Refined Analytic Torsion on Manifolds with Boundary" we have presented a construction of refined analytic torsion in the spirit of Braverman and Kappeler, which does apply to compact manifolds with and without boundary. We now derive a gluing formula for our construction, which can be viewed as a gluing law for the original definition of refined analytic torsion by Braverman and Kappeler. A gluing formula allows to compute the torsion invariant by cutting the manifold into elementary pieces and performing computations on each component. Certainly, the general fact of existence of such gluing formulas is remarkable from the analytic point of view, since the secondary spectral invariants are uppermost non-local. 
0808.00452	Reflecting magnons from D7 and D5 branes	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:D. H. Correa, C. A. S. Young	Abstract:  We obtain the reflection matrices for the scattering of elementary magnons from certain open boundaries, corresponding to open strings ending on D7 and D5 branes in $AdS_5\times S^5$. In each case we consider two possible orientations for the vacuum state. We show that symmetry arguments are sufficient to determine the reflection matrices up to at most two unknown functions. The D7 reflection matrices obey the boundary Yang Baxter-Equation. This is automatic for one vacuum orientation, and requires a natural choice of ratio between two unknowns for the other. In contrast, the D5 reflection matrices do not obey the boundary Yang Baxter-Equation. In both cases we show consistency with the existent weak and strong coupling results. 
0808.00453	Z0 Boson Measurement with the ALICE Central Barrel in pp collisions at 14 TeV	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:R. Bailhache, A. Andronic, P. Braun-Munzinger	Abstract:  The possibility to detect the Z0 in the ALICE central barrel is studied via the electronic decay channel Z0->e+e-. The signal and the background are simulated with the leading order event generator PYTHIA 6. The total cross-sections are taken from NLO calculations. Based on test beam data, the electron identification performance of the Transition Radiation Detector is extrapolated to high momenta. The expected yields for minimum-bias pp collisions at 14 TeV are presented. An isolation cut on the single electron, together with a minimum transverse momentum cut, allows to obtain a clear signal. The expected background is of the order of 1 % with the main contribution coming from misidentified pions from jets. 
0808.00454	Terahertz metamaterials on free-standing highly-flexible polyimide substrates	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:H. Tao, A. C. Strikwerda, K. Fan, C.M. Bingham, W. J. Padilla, X. Zhang, R. D. Averitt	Abstract:  We have fabricated resonant terahertz metamaterials on free standing polyimide substrates. The low-loss polyimide substrates can be as thin as 5.5 micron yielding robust large-area metamaterials which are easily wrapped into cylinders with a radius of a few millimeters. Our results provide a path forward for creating multi-layer non-planar metamaterials at terahertz frequencies. 
0808.00455	XMM-Newton Observations of the Nuclei of the Radio Galaxies 3C 305, DA 240, and 4C 73.08	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Daniel A. Evans (1,2), Martin J. Hardcastle (3), Julia C. Lee (1,2), Ralph P. Kraft (2), Diana M. Worrall (4), Mark Birkinshaw (4), Judith H. Croston (3) ((1) Harvard University, Department of Astronomy, (2) Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, (3) University of Hertfordshire, (4) University of Bristol)    	Abstract:  We present new XMM-Newton EPIC observations of the nuclei of the nearby radio galaxies 3C 305, DA 240, and 4C 73.08, and investigate the origin of their nuclear X-ray emission. The nuclei of the three sources appear to have different relative contributions of accretion- and jet-related X-ray emission, as expected based on earlier work. The X-ray spectrum of the FRII narrow-line radio galaxy (NLRG) 4C 73.08 is modeled with the sum of a heavily absorbed power law that we interpret to be associated with a luminous accretion disk and circumnuclear obscuring structure, and an unabsorbed power law that originates in an unresolved jet. This behavior is consistent with other narrow-line radio galaxies. The X-ray emission of the low-excitation FRII radio galaxy DA 240 is best modeled as an unabsorbed power law that we associate with a parsec-scale jet, similar to other low-excitation sources that we have studied previously. However, the X-ray nucleus of the narrow-line radio galaxy 3C 305 shows no evidence for the heavily absorbed X-ray emission that has been found in other NLRGs. It is possible that the nuclear optical spectrum in 3C 305 is intrinsically weak-lined, with the strong emission arising from extended regions that indicate the presence of jet--environment interactions. Our observations of 3C 305 suggest that this source is more closely related to other weak-lined radio galaxies. This ambiguity could extend to other sources currently classified as NLRGs. We also present XMM-Newton and VLA observations of the hotspot of DA 240, arguing that this is another detection of X-ray synchrotron emission from a low-luminosity hotspot. 
0808.00456	LOcalized modes on an Ablowitz-Ladik nonlinear impurity	Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)	Authors:M. I. Molina	Abstract:  We study localized modes on a single Ablowitz-Ladik impurity embedded in the bulk or at the surface of a one-dimensional linear lattice. Exact expressions are obtained for the bound state profile and energy. Dynamical excitation of the localized mode reveals exponentially-high amplitude oscillations of the spatial profile at the impurity location. The presence of a surface increases the minimum nonlinearity to effect a dynamical selftrapping. 
0808.00457	Formality of the little N-disks operad	Algebraic Topology (math.AT)	Authors:Pascal Lambrechts, Ismar Volic	Abstract:  We develop the details of Kontsevich's proof of the formality of little N-disks operad over the field of real numbers. Formality holds in the category of operads of chain complexes and also in some sense in the category of commutative differential graded algebras, which is the category encoding "real" homotopy theory. We also prove a relative version of the formality for the inclusion of the little m-disks operad in the little N-disks operad for N>=2m+1. 
0808.00458	Subcritical String and Large N QCD	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Charles B. Thorn	Abstract:  We pursue the possibility of using subcritical string theory in 4 space-time dimensions to establish a string dual for large N QCD. In particular we study the even G-parity sector of the 4 dimensional Neveu-Schwarz dual resonance model as the natural candidate for this string theory. Our point of view is that the open string dynamics given by this model will {\it determine} the appropriate subcritical closed string theory, a tree level background of which should describe the sum of planar multi-loop open string diagrams. We examine the one loop open string diagram, which contains information about the closed string spectrum at weak coupling. Higher loop open string diagrams will be needed to determine closed string interactions. We also analyze the field theory limit of the one loop open string diagram and recover the correct running coupling behavior of the limiting gauge theory. 
0808.00459	On the Danilov-Gizatullin Isomorphism Theorem	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Hubert Flenner, Shulim Kaliman, Mikhail Zaidenberg	Abstract:  A Danilov-Gizatullin surface is a normal affine surface V, which is a complement to an ample section S in a Hirzebruch surface of index d. By a surprising result due to Danilov and Gizatullin, V depends only on the self-intersection number of S and neither on d nor on S. In this note we provide a new and simple proof of this Isomorphism Theorem. 
0808.00460	Sums of squares on reducible real curves	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Daniel Plaumann	Abstract:  We ask whether every polynomial function that is non-negative on a real algebraic curve can be expressed as a sum of squares in the coordinate ring. Scheiderer has classified all irreducible curves for which this is the case. For reducible curves, we show how the answer depends on the configuration of the irreducible components and give complete necessary and sufficient conditions. We also prove partial results in the more general case of finitely generated preorderings and discuss applications to the moment problem for semialgebraic sets. 
0808.00461	X-ray Spectral Properties of the BAT AGN Sample	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:L.M. Winter (UMD), R. Mushotzky (NASA GSFC), C.S. Reynolds (UMD), J. Tueller (NASA GSFC)    	Abstract:  The 9-month Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) catalog provides the first unbiased (log N_H < 24) look at local (<z> = 0.03) AGN. In this paper, we present the collected X-ray properties (0.3 - 12keV) for the 153 AGN detected. In addition, we examine the X-ray properties for a complete sample of non-beamed sources, above the Galactic plane. Of these, 45% are best fit by simple power law models while 55% require the more complex partial covering model. One of our goals was to determine the fraction of "hidden" AGN, which we define as sources with scattering fractions < 0.03 and ratios of soft to hard X-ray flux < 0.04. We found that "hidden" AGN constitute a high percentage of the sample (24%), proving that they are a very significant portion of local AGN. Further, we find that the fraction of absorbed sources does increase at lower unabsorbed 2-10 keV luminosities, as well as accretion rates. Some of the most interesting results for the BAT AGN sample involve the host galaxy properties. We found that 33% are hosted in peculiar/irregular galaxies and only 5/74 hosted in ellipticals. Further, 54% are hosted in interacting/merger galaxies. Finally, we present both the average X-ray spectrum (0.1-10 keV) and log N-log S in the 2-10 keV band. With our average spectrum, we have the remarkable result of reproducing the measured CXB X-ray power law slope of ~ 1.4 (Marshall et al. 1980). From the log N-log S relationship, we show that we are complete to log S < -11 in the 2-10 keV band. Both the collected X-ray properties of our uniform sample and the log N-log S relationship will now provide valuable input to X-ray background models for z ~ 0. (abridged) 
0808.00462	Gamma Ray Burst Production and Supernova Signatures in Slowly Rotating Collapsars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Diego Lopez-Camara (1), William H. Lee (1), Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz (2) ((1) Instituto de Astronomia, UNAM, (2) Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, UCSC)    	Abstract:  We consider accretion onto newborn black holes following the collapse of rotating massive stellar cores, at the threshold where a centrifugally supported disk gives way to nearly radial inflow for low angular momentum. For realistic initial conditions taken from pre-supernova (pre-SN) evolution calculations, the densities and temperatures involved require the use of a detailed equation of state and neutrino cooling processes, as well as a qualitative consideration of the effects of general relativity. Through two-dimensional dynamical calculations we show how the energy release is affected by the rotation rate and the strength of angular momentum transport, giving rise to qualitatively different solutions in limits of high and low angular momentum, each being capable of powering a gamma-ray burst (GRB). We explore the likelihood of producing Fe-group elements in the two regimes and suggest that while large and massive centrifugally supported disks are capable of driving strong outflows with a possible SN-like signature, quasi-radial flows lack such a feature and may produce a GRB without such an accompanying feature, as seen in GRB060505. 
0808.00463	Measuring entropy generated by spin-transfer	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:J.-E. Wegrowe, Q. Anh Nguyen, T.L. Wade	Abstract:  An experimental protocol is presented that allows the entropy generated by spin-transfer to be measured. The effect of a strong spin-polarized current injected on a ferromagnetic nanostructure is investigated with focusing on the quasi-static equilibrium states of a ferromagnetic single domain. The samples are single contacted Ni nanowires obtained by electrodeposition in a nanoporous template. The thermal susceptibility of the magnetoresistance is measured as a function of the magnetic field for different values of the current injected through the wire. This quantity is related to the thermal magnetic susceptibility of the ferromagnetic wire through the anisotropic magnetoresistance. The ferromagnetic entropy generated by the current injection is deduced thanks to a thermodynamic Maxwell relation. This study shows that the effect of the spin-transfer in our samples results in the generation of incoherent excitations instead of rotation of the magnetization. 
0808.00464	Role of relaxation in the quantum measurement of a superconducting qubit using a nonlinear oscillator	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:T. Picot, A. Lupascu, S. Saito, C.J.P.M. Harmans, J.E. Mooij	Abstract:  We analyze the relaxation of a superconducting flux qubit during measurement. The qubit state is measured with a nonlinear oscillator driven across the threshold of bifurcation, acting as a switching dispersive detector. This readout scheme is of quantum non-demolition type. Two successive readouts are used to analyze the evolution of the qubit and the detector during the measurement. We introduce a simple transition rate model to characterize the qubit relaxation and the detector switching process. Corrected for qubit relaxation the readout fidelity is at least 95%. Qubit relaxation strongly depends on the driving strength and the state of the oscillator. 
0808.00465	In situ reduction of charge noise in GaAs/AlGaAs Schottky-gated devices	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Christo Buizert, Frank H.L. Koppens, Michel Pioro-Ladriere, Hans-Peter Tranitz, Ivo T. Vink, Seigo Tarucha, Werner Wegscheider, Lieven M.K. Vandersypen	Abstract:  We show that an insulated electrostatic gate can be used to strongly suppress ubiquitous background charge noise in Schottky-gated GaAs/AlGaAs devices. Via a 2-D self-consistent simulation of the conduction band profile we show that this observation can be explained by reduced leakage of electrons from the Schottky gates into the semiconductor through the Schottky barrier, consistent with the effect of "bias cooling". Upon noise reduction, the noise power spectrum generally changes from Lorentzian to $1/f$ type. By comparing wafers with different Al content, we exclude that DX centers play a dominant role in the charge noise. 
0808.00466	Quantum Reflection of S-wave Unstable States	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:N. G. Kelkar	Abstract:  The phase time in quantum tunneling can be disentangled into a dwell time plus a term arising due to the interference of the reflected and incident waves in front of the barrier. The interference term dominates at low energies and as E --> 0, this term and hence the phase time becomes singular. With the s-wave motion in three dimensions being equivalent to that of a one-dimensional motion in the radial coordinate, a similar singularity shows up in the phase time delay of s-wave resonances. Relating the scattering matrix in three dimensional collisions to the reflection amplitude, the interference term in tunneling can be identified as a term given in terms of the transition matrix in scattering. Subtraction of this term from the phase time delay gives the dwell time delay which is finite at all energies and is useful in characterizing s-wave resonances such as the sigma meson and mesic nuclei near threshold. 
0808.00467	Fourier Series Of the Derivatives of Hurwitz and Lerch Zeta Functions	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Vivek V.Rane	Abstract:  As a function of second variable, we identify the Fourier series of Hurwitz zeta function and its derivatives on the unit interval. Consequently, we obtain results based on the formula for Fourier coefficients and also on Parseval's theorem. We do likewise in the case of Lerch's zeta function and its derivatives. 
0808.00468	On a correspondence between regular and non-regular operator monotone functions	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:P. Gibilisco, F. Hansen, T. Isola	Abstract:  We prove that there is a bijection between the families of regular and non-regular operator monotone functions. As an application we give a new proof of the operator monotonicity of a certain class of functions related to Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information. 
0808.00469	Non-degeneracy of Pollard Rho Collisions	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Stephen D. Miller, Ramarathnam Venkatesan	Abstract:  The Pollard Rho algorithm is a widely used algorithm for solving discrete logarithms on general cyclic groups, including elliptic curves. Recently the first nontrivial runtime estimates were provided for it, culminating in a sharp O(sqrt(n)) bound for the collision time on a cyclic group of order n. In this paper we show that for n satisfying a mild arithmetic condition, the collisions guaranteed by these results are nondegenerate with high probability: that is, the Pollard Rho algorithm successfully finds the discrete logarithm. 
0808.00470	Gravity in Gauge Mediation	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Zygmunt Lalak, Stefan Pokorski, Krzysztof Turzynski	Abstract:  We investigate O'Raifeartaigh-type models for F-term supersymmetry breaking in gauge mediation scenarios in the presence of gravity. It is pointed out that the vacuum structure of those models is such that in metastable vacua gravity mediation contribution to scalar masses is always suppressed to the level below 1 percent, almost sufficient for avoiding FCNC problem. Close to that limit, gravitino mass can be in the range 10-100 GeV, opening several interesting possibilities for gauge mediation models, including Giudice-Masiero mechanism for mu and Bmu generation. Gravity sector can include stabilized moduli. 
0808.00471	Disks around Brown Dwarfs in the Sigma Orionis Cluster	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:K. L. Luhman, J. Hernandez, J. J. Downes, L. Hartmann, C. Briceno	Abstract:  We have performed a census of disks around brown dwarfs in the Sigma Ori cluster using all available images from IRAC onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. To search for new low-mass cluster members with disks, we have measured photometry for all sources in the Spitzer images and have identified the ones that have red colors that are indicative of disks. We present 5 promising candidates, which may consist of 2 brown dwarfs, 2 stars with edge-on disks, and a low-mass protostar if they are bona fide members. Spectroscopy is needed to verify the nature of these sources. We have also used the Spitzer data to determine which of the previously known probable members of Sigma Ori are likely to have disks. By doing so, we measure disk fractions of ~40% and ~60% for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, respectively. These results are similar to previous estimates of disk fractions in IC 348 and Cha I, which have roughly the same median ages as Sigma Ori (3 Myr). Finally, we note that our photometric measurements and the sources that we identify as having disks differ significantly from those of other recent studies that analyzed the same Spitzer images. For instance, previous work has suggested that the T dwarf S Ori 70 is redder than typical field dwarfs, which has been cited as possible evidence of youth and cluster membership. However, we find that this object is only slightly redder than the reddest field dwarfs in [3.6]-[4.5] (1.56+/-0.07 vs. 0.93-1.46). We measure a larger excess in [3.6]-[5.8] (1.75+/-0.21 vs. 0.87-1.19), but the flux at 5.8um may be overestimated because of the low signal-to-noise ratio of the detection. Thus, the Spitzer data do not offer strong evidence of youth and membership for this object, which is the faintest and coolest candidate member of Sigma Ori that has been identified to date. 
0808.00472	Dark Stars: Dark Matter in the First Stars leads to a New Phase of Stellar Evolution	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Katherine Freese, Douglas Spolyar, Anthony Aguirre, Peter Bodenheimer, Paolo Gondolo, J.A. Sellwood, Naoki Yoshida	Abstract:  The first phase of stellar evolution in the history of the universe may be Dark Stars, powered by dark matter heating rather than by fusion. Weakly interacting massive particles, which are their own antiparticles, can annihilate and provide an important heat source for the first stars in the the universe. This talk presents the story of these Dark Stars. We make predictions that the first stars are very massive ($\sim 800 M_\odot$), cool (6000 K), bright ($\sim 10^6 L_\odot$), long-lived ($\sim 10^6$ years), and probable precursors to (otherwise unexplained) supermassive black holes. Later, once the initial DM fuel runs out and fusion sets in, DM annihilation can predominate again if the scattering cross section is strong enough, so that a Dark Star is born again. 
0808.00473	Anomalous Emission from HII regions	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:C. Dickinson (IPAC/Caltech)    	Abstract:  Spinning dust appears to be the best explanation for the anomalous emission that has been observed at $\sim 10-60$ GHz. One of the best examples of spinning dust comes from a HII region in the Perseus molecular cloud. Observations of other HII regions also show tentative evidence for excess emission at frequencies $\sim 30$ GHz, although at lower emissivity levels. A new detection of excess emission at 31 GHz in the HII region RCW175 has been made. The most plausible explanation again comes from spinning dust. HII regions are a good place to look for spinning dust as long as accurate radio data spanning the $\sim 5-100$ GHz range is available. 
0808.00474	Tellurium substitution effect on superconductivity of the alpha-phase Iron Selenide	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Kuo-Wei Yeh, Tzu-Wen Huang, Yi-Lin Huang, Ta-Kun Chen, Fong-Chi Hsu, Phillip M. Wu, Yong-Chi Lee, Yan-Yi Chu, Chi-Liang Chen, Jiu-Yong Luo, Der-Chung Yan, Maw-Kuen Wu	Abstract:  We have carried out a systematic study of the PbO-type compound FeSe_{1-x}Te_x (x = 0~1), where Te substitution effect on superconductivity is investigated. It is found that superconducting transition temperature reaches a maximum of Tc=15.2K at about 50% Te substitution. The pressure-enhanced Tc of FeSe0.5Te0.5 is more than 10 times larger than that of FeSe. Interestingly, FeTe is no longer superconducting. A low temperature structural distortion changes FeTe from triclinic symmetry to orthorhombic symmetry. We believe that this structural change breaks the magnetic symmetry and suppresses superconductivity in FeTe.

Glass	Abstract:  A relation between stress-energy and motion is derived for accelerated Israel layers. The relation, for layers between two Schwarzschild manifolds, generalizes the equation of state for geodesic collapse. A set of linked layers is discussed. 
0808.00476	Analysis of the spectral function of Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO4, obtained by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:F. Schmitt, W. S. Lee, D.-H. Lu, W. Meevasana, E. Motoyama, M. Greven, Z.-X. Shen	Abstract:  Samples of Nd(2-x)Ce(x)CuO(4), an electron-doped high temperature superconducting cuprate (HTSC), near optimal doping at x = 0.155 were measured via angle resolved photoemission (ARPES). We report a renormalization feature in the self energy ("kink") in the band dispersion at 50 - 60 meV present in nodal and antinodal cuts across the Fermi surface. Specifically, while the kink had previously only been seen in the antinodal region, it is now observed also in the nodal region, reminiscent of what has been observed in hole-doped cuprates. 
0808.00477	Measuring the Higgs-Vector boson Couplings at Linear $e^{+} e^{-}$ Collider	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Sukanta Dutta, Kaoru Hagiwara, Yu Matsumoto	Abstract:  We estimate the accuracy with which the coefficient of the CP even dimension six operators involving Higgs and two vector bosons (HVV) can be measured at linear $e^+ e^-$ colliders. Using the optimal observables method for the kinematic distributions, our analysis is based on the five different processes. First is the WW fusion process in the t-channel ($e^+e^- \to \barν_e ν_e H$), where we use the rapidity y and the transverse momentum $\pT$ of the Higgs boson as observables. Second is the ZH pair production process in the s-channel, where we use the scattering angle of the Z and the Z decay angular distributions, reproducing the results of the previous studies. Third is the t-channel ZZ, fusion processes ($e^+e^- \to e^+e^ -H$), where we use the energy and angular distributions of the tagged $e^+$ and $e^-$. In the fourth, we consider the rapidity distribution of the untagged $e^+e^-H$ events, which can be approximated well as the $γγ$ fusion of the bremsstrahlung photons from $e^+$ and $e^-$ beams. As the last process,we consider the single tagged $e^+e^- H$ events, which probe the $γe^{\pm} \to H e^{\pm}$ process. All the results are presented in such a way that statistical errors of the constraints on the effective couplings and their correlations are read off when all of them are allowed to vary simultaneously, for each of the above processes, for $m_H=120 $ GeV, at $\sqrt{s}=250\GEV$, $350\GEV$ $500\GEV$ and $1\TEV$, with and without $e^-$ beam polarization of 80%. 
0808.00478	Description of the Giant Monopole Resonance in the Even-A $^{112-124}$Sn Isotopes within the Microscopic Model Including Quasiparticle-Phonon Coupling	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:A. Avdeenkov, F. Gruemmer, S. Kamerdzhiev, S. Krewald, E. Litvinova, N. Lyutorovich, J. Speth, V. Tselyaev	Abstract:  We have calculated the strength distributions of the giant monopole resonance in the even-A tin isotopes (A = 112-124) which were recently measured in inelastic $α$-scattering. The calculations were performed within two microscopic models: the quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA) and the quasiparticle time blocking approximation which is an extension of the QRPA including quasiparticle-phonon coupling. We used a self-consistent calculational scheme based on the HF+BCS approximation. The single-particle continuum was exactly included on the RPA level. The self-consistent mean field and the effective interaction were derived from the Skyrme energy functional. In the calculations, two Skyrme force parametrizations were used. The T5 parametrization with comparatively low value of the incompressibility of infinite nuclear matter ($K_{\infty}$ = 202 MeV) gives theoretical results in good agreement with the experimental data including the resonance widths. 
0808.00479	Dynamics of a one-dimensional spinor Bose liquid: a phenomenological approach	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:A. Kamenev, L.I. Glazman	Abstract:  The ground state of a spinor Bose liquid is ferromagnetic, while the softest excitation above the ground state is the magnon mode. The dispersion relation of the magnon in a one-dimensional liquid is periodic in the wavenumber q with the period 2πn, determined by the density n of the liquid. Dynamic correlation functions, such as e.g. spin-spin correlation function, exhibit power-law singularities at the magnon spectrum, $ω\toω_m(q,n)$. Without using any specific model of the inter-particle interactions, we relate the corresponding exponents to independently measurable quantities $\partialω_m/\partial q$ and $\partialω_m/\partial n$. 
0808.00480	Force Dependent Hopping Rates of RNA Hairpins can be Estimated from Accurate Measurement of the Folding Landscapes	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Changbong Hyeon, Greg Morrison, D. Thirumalai	Abstract:  The sequence-dependent folding landscapes of nucleic acid hairpins reflect much of the complexity of biomolecular folding. Folding trajectories, generated using single molecule force clamp experiments by attaching semiflexible polymers to the ends of hairpins have been used to infer their folding landscapes. Using simulations and theory, we study the effect of the dynamics of the attached handles on the handle-free RNA free energy profile $F^o_{eq}(z_m)$, where $z_m$ is the molecular extension of the hairpin. Accurate measurements of $F^o_{eq}(z_m)$ requires stiff polymers with small $L/l_p$, where $L$ is the contour length of the handle, and $l_p$ is the persistence length. Paradoxically, reliable estimates of the hopping rates can only be made using flexible handles. Nevertheless, we show that the equilibrium free energy profile $F^o_{eq}(z_m)$ at an external tension $f_m$, the force ($f$) at which the folded and unfolded states are equally populated, in conjunction with Kramers' theory, can provide accurate estimates of the force-dependent hopping rates in the absence of handles at arbitrary values of $f$. Our theoretical framework shows that $z_m$ is a good reaction coordinate for nucleic acid hairpins under tension. 
0808.00481	Physical conditions in nearby active galaxies correlated with ultra-high-energy cosmic rays detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Sergey Gureev, Sergey Troitsky	Abstract:  We analyze the active-galaxy correlation reported in 2007 by the Pierre Auger Collaboration. The signal diminishes if the correlation-function approach (counting all "source-event" pairs and not only "nearest neighbours") is used, suggesting that the correlation may reveal individual sources and not their population. We analyze available data on physical conditions in these individual correlated sources and conclude that acceleration of protons to the observed energies is hardly possible in any of these galaxies, while heavier nuclei would be deflected by the Galactic magnetic field thus spoiling the correlation. Our results question the Auger interpretation of the reported anisotropy signal but do not contradict to its explanation with intermediate-mass nuclei accelerated in Cen A. 
0808.00482	Hyperons in Two Flavor Chiral Perturbation Theory	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Brian C. Tiburzi, Andre Walker-Loud	Abstract:  We use two-flavor chiral perturbation theory to describe hyperons. We focus on the strangeness conserving sector, and, as an example, calculate hyperon masses. Convergence of this two-flavor chiral expansion for observables is improved over the three-flavor theory. The cost, however, is a larger number of low-energy constants that must be ultimately determined from lattice QCD data. A formula for the mass of the omega baryon is derived to sixth order in this expansion, and will aid lattice practitioners in scale setting or tuning the strange quark mass. 
0808.00483	Symplectic Integrator Mercury: Bug Report	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:K. de Souza Torres, D. R. Anderson	Abstract:  We report on a problem found in MERCURY, a hybrid symplectic integrator used for dynamical problems in Astronomy. The variable that keeps track of bodies' statuses is uninitialised, which can result in bodies disappearing from simulations in a non-physical manner. Some FORTRAN compilers implicitly initialise variables, preventing simulations from having this problem. With other compilers, simulations with a suitably large maximum number of bodies parameter value are also unaffected. Otherwise, the problem manifests at the first event after the integrator is started, whether from scratch or continuing a previously stopped simulation. Although the problem does not manifest in some conditions, explicitly initialising the variable solves the problem in a permanent and unconditional manner. 
0808.00484	PHENIX Results on Jet Correlations versus Reaction Plane	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:David Winter	Abstract:  In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, studying jet correlations and their dependence on the angle of emission with respect to the reaction plane can be used to shed light on the path length dependence of the energy lost by the jet. In this paper, we present recent PHENIX results on jet correlations versus reaction plane, as a function of centrality and transverse momentum. 
0808.00485	Spectral duality for a class of unbounded operators	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Dorin Ervin Dutkay, Palle E.T. Jorgensen	Abstract:  We establish a spectral duality for certain unbounded operators in Hilbert space. The class of operators includes discrete graph Laplacians arising from infinite weighted graphs. The problem in this context is to establish a practical approximation of infinite models with suitable sequences of finite models which in turn allow (relatively) easy computations. Let $X$ be an infinite set and let $\H$ be a Hilbert space of functions on $X$ with inner product $\ip{\cdot}{\cdot}=\ip{\cdot}{\cdot}_{\H}$. We will be assuming that the Dirac masses $δ_x$, for $x\in X$, are contained in $\H$. And we then define an associated operator $Δ$ in $\H$ given by $$(Δ v)(x):=\ip{δ_x}{v}_{\H}.$$ Similarly, for every finite subset $F\subset X$, we get an operator $Δ_F$. If $F_1\subset F_2\subset...$ is an ascending sequence of finite subsets such that $\cup_{k\in\bn}F_k=X$, we are interested in the following two problems: (a) obtaining an approximation formula $$\lim_{k\to\infty}Δ_{F_k}=Δ;$$ and (b) establish a computational spectral analysis for the truncated operators $Δ_F$ in (a). 
0808.00486	Special comparison theorem for the Dirac equation	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Richard L. Hall	Abstract:  If a central vector potential V(r,a) in the Dirac equation is monotone in a parameter 'a', then a discrete eigenvalue E(a) is monotone in 'a'. For such a special class of comparisons, this generalizes an earlier comparison theorem that was restricted to node free states. Moreover, the present theorem applies to every discrete eigenvalue. 
0808.00487	A Multivariate Fast Discrete Walsh Transform with an Application to Function Interpolation	Numerical Analysis (math.NA)	Authors:Kwong-Ip Liu, Josef Dick, Fred J. Hickernell	Abstract:  For high dimensional problems, such as approximation and integration, one cannot afford to sample on a grid because of the curse of dimensionality. An attractive alternative is to sample on a low discrepancy set, such as an integration lattice or a digital net. This article introduces a multivariate fast discrete Walsh transform for data sampled on a digital net that requires only $O(N \log N)$ operations, where $N$ is the number of data points. This algorithm and its inverse are digital analogs of multivariate fast Fourier transforms. This fast discrete Walsh transform and its inverse may be used to approximate the Walsh coefficients of a function and then construct a spline interpolant of the function. This interpolant may then be used to estimate the function's effective dimension, an important concept in the theory of numerical multivariate integration. Numerical results for various functions are presented. 
0808.00488	Klein Backscattering and Fabry-Perot Interference in Graphene Heterojunctions	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:A. V. Shytov, M. S. Rudner, L. S. Levitov	Abstract:  We present a theory of quantum-coherent transport through a lateral p-n-p structure in graphene, which fully accounts for the interference of forward and backward scattering on the p-n interfaces. The backreflection amplitude changes sign at zero incidence angle because of the Klein phenomenon, adding a phase $π$ to the interference fringes. The contributions of the two p-n interfaces to the phase of the interference cancel with each other at zero magnetic field, but become imbalanced at a finite field. The resulting half a period shift in the Fabry-Perot fringe pattern, induced by a relatively weak magnetic field, can provide a clear signature of Klein scattering in graphene. This effect is shown to be robust in the presence of spatially inhomogeneous potential of moderate strength. 
0808.00489	A new approach to the star-genvalue equation	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:M. de Gosson, Franz Luef	Abstract:  We show that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the stargenvalue equation can be completely expressed in terms of the corresponding eigenvalue problem for the quantum Hamiltonian. Our method makes use of a Weyl-type representation of the star-product and of the properties of the cross-Wigner transform, which appears as an intertwining operator. 
0808.00490	Thermal Right-Handed Sneutrino Dark Matter in the F_D-Term Model of Hybrid Inflation	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Frank Deppisch, Apostolos Pilaftsis	Abstract:  We compute the relic abundance of the right-handed sneutrinos in the supersymmetric F_D-term model of hybrid inflation. As well as providing a natural solution to the mu- and gravitino overabundance problems, the F_D-term model offers a new viable candidate to account for the cold dark matter in the Universe: the lightest right-handed sneutrino. In particular, the F_D-term model predicts a new quartic coupling of purely right-handed sneutrinos to the Higgs doublets that thermalizes the sneutrinos and makes them annihilate sufficiently fast to a level compatible with the current cosmic microwave background data. We analyze this scenario in detail and identify favourable regions of the parameter space within the framework of minimal supergravity, for which the lightest right-handed sneutrino becomes the thermal dark matter, in agreement with WMAP observations of cosmological inflation. Constraints derived from direct dark matter searches experiments are presented. 
0808.00491	Generalized unitarity for N=4 super-amplitudes	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:J.M.Drummond, J.Henn, G.P.Korchemsky, E.Sokatchev	Abstract:  We develop a manifestly supersymmetric version of the generalized unitarity cut method for calculating scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM theory. We illustrate the power of this method by computing the one-loop n-point NMHV super-amplitudes. The result confirms two conjectures which we made in arXiv:0807.1095 [hep-th]. Firstly, we derive the compact, manifestly dual superconformally covariant form of the NMHV tree amplitudes for arbitrary number and types of external particles. Secondly, we show that the ratio of the one-loop NMHV to the MHV amplitude is dual conformal invariant. 
0808.00492	Local structures of polar wurtzites Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}O studied by Raman and {67}Zn/{25}Mg NMR spectroscopies and by total neutron scattering	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Young-Il Kim, Sylvian Cadars, Ramzy Shayib, Thomas Proffen, Charles S. Feigerle, Bradley F. Chmelka, Ram Seshadri	Abstract:  Local compositions and structures of Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}O alloys have been investigated by Raman and solid-state {67}Zn/{25}Mg nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies, and by neutron pair-distribution-function (PDF) analyses. The E2(low) and E2(high) Raman modes of Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}O display Gaussian- and Lorentzian-type profiles, respectively. At higher Mg substitutions, both modes become broader, while their peak positions shift in opposite directions. The evolution of Raman spectra from Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}O solid solutions are discussed in terms of lattice deformation associated with the distinct coordination preferences of Zn and Mg. Solid-state magic-angle-spinning (MAS) NMR studies suggest that the local electronic environments of {67}Zn in ZnO are only weakly modified by the 15% substitution of Mg for Zn. {25}Mg MAS spectra of Zn_{0.85}Mg_{0.15}O show an unusual upfield shift, demonstrating the prominent shielding ability of Zn in the nearby oxidic coordination sphere. Neutron PDF analyses of Zn_{0.875}Mg_{0.125}O using a 2x2x1 supercell corresponding to Zn_{7}MgO_{8} suggest that the mean local geometry of MgO_{4} fragments concurs with previous density functional theory (DFT)-based structural relaxations of hexagonal wurtzite MgO. MgO_{4} tetrahedra are markedly compressed along their c-axes and are smaller in volume than ZnO_{4} units by ~6%. Mg atoms in Zn_{1-x}Mg_{x}O have a shorter bond to the $c$-axial oxygen atom than to the three lateral oxygen atoms, which is distinct from the coordination of Zn. The precise structure, both local and average, of Zn_{0.875}Mg_{0.125}O obtained from time-of-flight total neutron scattering supports the view that Mg-substitution in ZnO results in increased total spontaneous polarization. 
0808.00493	The dust un-biased cosmic star formation history from the 20 cm VLA-COSMOS survey	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:V. Smolcic, E. Schinnerer, G. Zamorani, E. F. Bell, M. Bondi, C. L. Carilli, P. Ciliegi, B. Mobasher, T. Paglione, M. Scodeggio, N. Scoville	Abstract:  We derive the cosmic star formation history (CSFH) out to z=1.3 using a sample of ~350 radio-selected star-forming galaxies, a far larger sample than in previous, similar studies. We attempt to differentiate between radio emission from AGN and star-forming galaxies, and determine an evolving 1.4 GHz luminosity function based on these VLA-COSMOS star forming galaxies. We precisely measure the high-luminosity end of the star forming galaxy luminosity function (SFR>100 M_Sol/yr; equivalent to ULIRGs) out to z=1.3, finding a somewhat slower evolution than previously derived from mid-infrared data. We find that more stars are forming in luminous starbursts at high redshift. We use extrapolations based on the local radio galaxy luminosity function; assuming pure luminosity evolution, we derive $L_* \propto (1+z)^{2.1 \pm 0.2}$ or $L_* \propto (1+z)^{2.5 \pm 0.1}$, depending on the choice of the local radio galaxy luminosity function. Thus, our radio-derived results independently confirm the ~1 order of magnitude decline in the CSFH since z~1. 
0808.00494	Simulations of AGN feedback in galaxy clusters and groups: impact on gas fractions and the Lx-T scaling relation	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ewald Puchwein, Debora Sijacki, Volker Springel	Abstract:  Recently, rapid observational and theoretical progress has established that black holes (BHs) play a decisive role in the formation and evolution of individual galaxies as well as galaxy groups and clusters. In particular, there is compelling evidence that BHs vigorously interact with their surroundings in the central regions of galaxy clusters, indicating that any realistic model of cluster formation needs to account for these processes. This is also suggested by the failure of previous generations of hydrodynamical simulations without BH physics to simultaneously account for the paucity of strong cooling flows in clusters, the slope and amplitude of the observed cluster scaling relations, and the high-luminosity cut-off of central cluster galaxies. Here we use high-resolution cosmological simulations of a large cluster and group sample to study how BHs affect their host systems. We focus on two specific properties, the halo gas fraction and the X-ray luminosity-temperature scaling relation, both of which are notoriously difficult to reproduce in self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations. We show that BH feedback can solve both of these issues, bringing them in excellent agreement with observations, without alluding to the `cooling only' solution that produces unphysically bright central galaxies. By comparing a large sample of simulated AGN-heated clusters with observations, our new simulation technique should make it possible to reliably calibrate observational biases in cluster surveys, thereby enabling various high-precision cosmological studies of the dark matter and dark energy content of the universe. 
0808.00495	Imaging bond order near non-magnetic impurities in square lattice antiferromagnets	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Ribhu K. Kaul, Roger G. Melko, Max A. Metlitski, Subir Sachdev	Abstract:  We study the textures of generalized "charge densities" (scalar objects invariant under time reversal), in the vicinity of non-magnetic impurities in square-lattice quantum anti-ferromagnets, by order parameter field theories. Our central finding is the structure of the "vortex" in the generalized density wave order parameter centered at the non-magnetic impurity. Using exact numerical data from quantum Monte Carlo simulations on an antiferromagnetic spin model, we are able to verify the results of our field theoretic study. We extend our phenomenological approach to the period-4 bond-centered density wave found in the underdoped cuprates. 
0808.00496	Edge and impurity response in two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Max A. Metlitski, Subir Sachdev	Abstract:  Motivated by recent Monte-Carlo simulations of Hoglund and Sandvik (arXiv:0808.0408), we study edge response in square lattice quantum antiferromagnets. We use the O(3) non-linear sigma-model to compute the decay asymptotics of the staggered magnetization, energy density and local magnetic susceptibility away from the edge. We find that the total edge susceptibility is negative and diverges logarithmically as the temperature vanishes. We confirm the predictions of the continuum theory by performing a 1/S expansion of the microscopic Heisenberg model with the edge. We propose a qualitative explanation of the edge dimerization seen in Monte-Carlo simulations by a theory of valence-bond-solid correlations in the Neel state. We also discuss the extension of the latter theory to the response of a single non-magnetic impurity, and its connection to the theory of the deconfined critical point. 
0808.00497	Dijet signals for low mass strings at the LHC	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Luis A Anchordoqui, Haim Goldberg, Dieter Lust, Satoshi Nawata, Stephan Stieberger, Tomasz R. Taylor	Abstract:  We consider extensions of the standard model based on open strings ending on D-branes, with gauge bosons due to strings attached to stacks of D-branes and chiral matter due to strings stretching between intersecting D-branes. Assuming that the fundamental string mass scale is in the TeV range and the theory is weakly coupled, we discuss possible signals of string physics at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In such D-brane constructions, the dominant contributions to full-fledged string amplitudes for all the common QCD parton subprocesses leading to dijets are completely independent of the details of compactification, and can be evaluated in a parameter-free manner. We make use of these amplitudes evaluated near the first resonant pole to determine the discovery potential of LHC for the first Regge excitations of the quark and gluon. Remarkably, the reach of LHC after a few years of running can be as high as 6.8 TeV. Even after the first 100 pb^{-1} of integrated luminosity, string scales as high as 4.0 TeV can be discovered. For string scales as high as 5.0 TeV, observations of resonant structures in pp \to {\rm direct} γ+ jet can provide interesting corroboration for string physics at the TeV-scale. 
0808.00498	Dynamical effects of the long bar in the Milky Way	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Esko Gardner, Kimmo A. Innanen, Chris Flynn	Abstract:  We examine the dynamical effects on disk stars of a "long bar" in the Milky Way by inserting a triaxial rotating bar into an axisymmetric disk+bulge+dark halo potential and integrating 3-D orbits of 104 tracer stars over a period of 2 Gyr. The long bar has been detected via "clump giants" in the IR by Lopez-Corredoira et al. (2007), and is estimated to have semi-major axes of (3.9 : 0.6 : 0.1) kpc and a mass of 6 10^9 Msun. We find such a structure has a slight impact on the inner disk-system, moving tracers near to the bar into the bar-region, as well as into the bulge. These effects are under continuing study. 
0808.00499	Interferometric probe of paired states	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:V. Gritsev, E. Demler, A. Polkovnikov	Abstract:  We propose a new method for detecting paired states in either bosonic or fermionic systems using interference experiments with independent or weakly coupled low dimensional systems. We demonstrate that our method can be used to detect both the FFLO and the d-wave paired states of fermions, as well as quasicondensates of singlet pairs for polar F=1 atoms in two dimensional systems. We discuss how this method can be used to perform phase-sensitive determination of the symmetry of the pairing amplitude. 
0808.00500	Superconformal Chern-Simons Theories and the Squashed Seven Sphere	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Hirosi Ooguri, Chang-Soon Park	Abstract:  We show that there are two supersymmetric completions of the three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory of level k with gauge group U(N)xU(N) coupled to four sets of massless scalars and spinors in the bi-fundamental representation, if we require Sp(2) global symmetry with the matter fields in the fundamental representation of SU(4). One is the N=6 superconformal theory recently studied in arXiv:0806.1218 [hep-th] and another is a new theory with N=1 superconformal symmetry. We conjecture that the N=1 theory is dual to M theory on AdS_4 x Squashed S^7/Z_k. 
0808.00501	I-V curves of Fe/MgO (001) single- and double-barrier tunnel junctions	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:J. Peralta-Ramos, A. M. Llois, I. Rungger, S. Sanvito	Abstract:  In this work, we calculate with ab initio methods the current-voltage characteristics for ideal single- and double-barrier Fe/MgO (001) magnetic tunnel junctions. The current is calculated in the phase-coherent limit by using the recently developed SMEAGOL code, combining the nonequilibrium Green function formalism with density-functional theory. In general we find that double-barrier junctions display a larger magnetoresistance, which decays with bias at a slower pace than their single-barrier counterparts. This is explained in terms of enhanced spin filtering from the middle Fe layer sandwiched in between the two MgO barriers. In addition, for double-barrier tunnel junctions, we find a well defined peak in the magnetoresistance at a voltage of V=0.1 V. This is the signature of resonant tunneling across a majority quantum well state. Our findings are discussed in relation to recent experiments. 
0808.00502	Highly Conducting Graphene Sheets and Langmuir-Blodgett Films	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Xiaolin Li, Guangyu Zhang, Xuedong Bai, Xiaoming Sun, Xinran Wang, Enge Wang, Hongjie Dai	Abstract:  Graphene is an intriguing material with properties that are distinct from those of other graphitic systems. The first samples of pristine graphene were obtained by peeling off and epitaxial growth. Recently, the chemical reduction of graphite oxide was used to produce covalently functionalized single-layer graphene oxide. However, chemical approaches for the large-scale production of highly conducting graphene sheets remain elusive. Here, we report that the exfoliation-reintercalation-expansion of graphite can produce high-quality single-layer graphene sheets stably suspended in organic solvents. The graphene sheets exhibit high electrical conductance at room and cryogenic temperatures. Large amounts of graphene sheets in organic solvents are made into large transparent conducting films by Langmuir-Blodgett assembly in a layer-by-layer manner. The chemically derived high quality graphene sheets could lead to future scalable graphene devices. 
0808.00503	Searching for Superhorizon Fluctuations in Heavy-Ion Collisions	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:Paul Sorensen	Abstract:  In this talk I discuss novel explanations for the azimuthal correlations observed in heavy-ion collisions. I review some ideas about correlations and the evolution of heavy-ion collisions. Some aspects of the correlations observed in heavy-ion collisions may be indicitive of the suppression of super-horizon fluctuations. 
0808.00504	On-Shell Recursion Relations for Generic Theories	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Clifford Cheung	Abstract:  We show that on-shell recursion relations hold for tree amplitudes in generic two derivative theories of multiple particle species and diverse spins. For example, in a gauge theory coupled to scalars and fermions, any amplitude with at least one gluon obeys a recursion relation. In (super)gravity coupled to scalars and fermions, the same holds for any amplitude with at least one graviton. This result pertains to a broad class of theories, including QCD, N=4 SYM, and N=8 supergravity. 
0808.00505	Derivation of the two dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation from many body quantum dynamics	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Kay Kirkpatrick, Benjamin Schlein, Gigliola Staffilani	Abstract:  We derive rigorously, for both R^2 and [-L, L]^2, the cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation in a suitable scaling limit from the two-dimensional many-body Bose systems with short-scale repulsive pair interactions. We first prove convergence of the solution of the BBGKY hierarchy, corresponding to the many-body systems, to a solution of the infinite Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy, corresponding to the cubic NLS; and then we prove uniqueness for the infinite hierarchy, which requires number-theoretical techniques in the periodic case. 
0808.00506	A Simple Proof of the Chiral Gravity Conjecture	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Andrew Strominger	Abstract:  Chiral gravity is three-dimensional asymptotically AdS3 gravity with an Einstein, cosmological, and Chern-Simons term at a critical value of the coupling denoted μ\ell=1. Ordinarily, excitations of AdS3 gravity are known to transform non-trivially under an asymptotic symmetry group consisting of both a left-moving and a right-moving conformal group. However it was recently conjectured in arXiv:0801.4566 that at the chiral point μ\ell=1 all excitations are chiral in that they transform only under the right-moving conformal group. We show herein that at the chiral point, the group of trivial diffeomorphisms is enhanced to include the left-moving conformal transformations, and the asymptotic symmetry group contains only one (right-moving) copy of the conformal group. Diffeomorphism invariance then requires that all physical excitations are annihilated by left-moving conformal transformations, establishing nonperturbatively the chiral nature of chiral gravity. 
0808.00507	The Mass of the Black Hole in the Quasar PG 2130+099	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:C. J. Grier, B. M. Peterson, M. C. Bentz, K. D. Denney, J. D. Eastman, M. Dietrich, R. W. Pogge, J. L. Prieto, D. L. DePoy, R. J. Assef, D. W. Atlee, J. Bird, M. E. Eyler, M. S. Peeples, R. Siverd, L. C. Watson, J. C. Yee	Abstract:  We present the results of a recent reverberation-mapping campaign undertaken to improve measurements of the radius of the broad line region and the central black hole mass of the quasar PG 2130+099. Cross correlation of the 5100 angstrom continuum and H-beta emission-line light curves yields a time lag of 22.9 (+4.4 - 4.3) days, corresponding to a central black hole mass MBH= 3.8 (+/- 1.5) x 10^7 Msun. This value supports the notion that previous measurements yielded an incorrect lag. We re-analyzed previous datasets to investigate the possible sources of the discrepancy and conclude that previous measurement errors were apparently caused by a combination of undersampling of the light curves and long-term secular changes in the H-beta emission-line equivalent width. With our new measurements, PG 2130+099 is no longer an outlier in either the R-L or the MBH-Sigma relationships. 
0808.00508	Neutralino Dark Matter as the Source of the WMAP Haze	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Gabriel Caceres, Dan Hooper	Abstract:  Previously, it has been argued that the anomalous emission from the region around the Galactic Center observed by WMAP, known as the ``WMAP Haze'', may be the synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons and positrons produced in dark matter annihilations. In particular, the angular distribution, spectrum, and intensity of the observed emission are consistent with the signal expected to result from a WIMP with an electroweak-scale mass and an annihilation cross section near the value predicted for a thermal relic. In this article, we revisit this signal within the context of supersymmetry, and evaluate the parameter space of the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM). We find that, over much of the supersymmetric parameter space, the lightest neutralino is predicted to possess the properties required to generate the WMAP Haze. In particular, the focus point, A-funnel, and bulk regions typically predict a neutralino with a mass, annihilation cross section, and dominant annihilation modes which are within the range required to produce the observed features of the WMAP Haze. The stau-coannihilation region, in contrast, is disfavored as an explanation for the origin of this signal. 
0808.00509	Evolving Clustered Random Networks	Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)	Authors:Shweta Bansal, Shashank Khandelwal, Lauren Ancel Meyers	Abstract:  We propose a Markov chain simulation method to generate simple connected random graphs with a specified degree sequence and level of clustering. The networks generated by our algorithm are random in all other respects and can thus serve as generic models for studying the impacts of degree distributions and clustering on dynamical processes as well as null models for detecting other structural properties in empirical networks. 
0808.00510	Quantum Networks on Cubelike Graphs	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Anna Bernasconi, Chris Godsil, Simone Severini	Abstract:  Cubelike graphs are the Cayley graphs of the elementary abelian group (Z_2)^n (e.g., the hypercube is a cubelike graph). We give conditions for perfect state transfer between two particles in quantum networks modeled by a large class of cubelike graphs. This generalizes results of Christandl et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 187902 (2004)] and Facer et al. [Phys. Rev. A 92, 187902 (2008)]. 
0808.00511	Magnetized GRB outflow model: weak reverse shock emission and short energy transfer timescale	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yi-Zhong Fan	Abstract:  We show that the absence of the bright optical flashes in most {\it Swift} Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) afterglows can be explained, if the reverse shock region is magnetized with a $σ\sim 1$, or the emission spectrum of the electrons accelerated in the mildly magnetized ($0.1<σ<1$) reverse shock front is very soft, or the reverse shock of a non-magnetized outflow is sub-relativistic, where $σ$ is the ratio of the magnetic energy flux to the particle energy flux. We also find that for $σ\gg 1$, the energy transfer between the magnetized ejecta and the forward shock may be too quick to account for the shallow decline phase that is well detected in many {\it Swift} GRB X-ray afterglows. 
0808.00512	O carater de Chern-Connes para C$^*$-sistemas dinamicos calculado em algumas algebras de operadores pseudodiferenciais	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:David P. Dias	Abstract:  Given a C$^*$-dynamical system $(A, G, α)$ one defines a homomorphism, called the Chern-Connes character, that take an element in $K_0(A) \oplus K_1(A)$, the K-theory groups of the C$^*$-algebra $A$, and maps it into $H_{\mathbb{R}}^*(G)$, the real deRham cohomology ring of $G$. We explictly compute this homomorphism for the examples $(\overline{Ψ_{cl}^0(S^1)}, S^1, α)$ and $(\overline{Ψ_{cl}^0(S^2)}, SO(3), α)$, where $\overline{Ψ_{cl}^0(M)}$ denotes the C$^*$-algebra generated by the classical pseudodifferential operators of zero order in the manifold $M$ and $α$ the action of conjugation by the regular representation (translations). 
0808.00513	Series Jackson networks and non-crossing probabilities	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:A.B. Dieker, J. Warren	Abstract:  This paper studies the queue length process in series Jackson networks with external input to the first station. We show that its Markov transition probabilities can be written as a finite sum of non-crossing probabilities, so that questions on time-dependent queueing behavior are translated to questions on non-crossing probabilities. This makes previous work on non-crossing probabilities relevant to queueing systems and allows new queueing results to be established. To illustrate the latter, we prove that the relaxation time (i.e., the reciprocal of the `spectral gap') of a positive recurrent system equals the relaxation time of an M/M/1 queue with the same arrival and service rates as the network's bottleneck station. This resolves a conjecture of Blanc, which he proved for two queues in series. 
0808.00514	A Class of Nonperturbative Configurations in Abelian-Higgs Models: Complexity from Dynamical Symmetry Breaking	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Marcelo Gleiser, Joel Thorarinson	Abstract:  We present a numerical investigation of the dynamics of symmetry breaking in both Abelian and non-Abelian $[S U (2)]$ Higgs models in three spatial dimensions. We find a class of time-dependent, long-lived nonperturbative field configurations within the range of parameters corresponding to type-1 superconductors, that is, with vector masses ($m_v$) larger than scalar masses ($m_s$). We argue that these emergent nontopological configurations are related to oscillons found previously in other contexts. For the Abelian-Higgs model, our lattice implementation allows us to map the range of parameter space -- the values of $β= (m_s /m_v)^2$ -- where such configurations exist and to follow them for times $t \sim Ø(10^5) m^{-1}$. An investigation of their properties for $\hat z$-symmetric models reveals an enormously rich structure of resonances and mode-mode oscillations reminiscent of excited atomic states. For the SU(2) case, we present preliminary results indicating the presence of similar oscillonic configurations. 
0808.00515	The volume densities of giant molecular clouds in M83	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jonathan S. Heiner, Ronald J. Allen, O. Ivy Wong, Pieter C. van der Kruit	Abstract:  Using observed GALEX far-ultraviolet (FUV) fluxes and VLA images of the 21-cm HI column densities, along with estimates of the local dust abundances, we measure the volume densities of a sample of actively star-forming giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the nearby spiral galaxy M83 on a typical resolution scale of 170 pc. Our approach is based on an equilibrium model for the cycle of molecular hydrogen formation on dust grains and photodissociation under the influence of the FUV radiation on the cloud surfaces of GMCs. We find a range of total volume densities on the surface of GMCs in M83, namely 0.1 - 400 cm-3 inside R25, 0.5 - 50 cm-3 outside R25 . Our data include a number of GMCs in the HI ring surrounding this galaxy. Finally, we discuss the effects of observational selection, which may bias our results. 
0808.00516	Spin squeezing of atomic ensembles by multi-colour quantum non-demolition measurements	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:M. Saffman, D. Oblak, J. Appel, E. S. Polzik	Abstract:  We analyze the creation of spin squeezed atomic ensembles by simultaneous dispersive interactions with several optical frequencies. A judicious choice of optical parameters enables optimization of an interferometric detection scheme that suppresses inhomogeneous light shifts and keeps the interferometer operating in a balanced mode that minimizes technical noise. We show that when the atoms interact with two-frequency light tuned to cycling transitions the degree of spin squeezing $ξ^2$ scales as $ξ^2\sim 1/d$ where $d$ is the resonant optical depth of the ensemble. In real alkali atoms there are loss channels and the scaling may be closer to $ξ^2\sim 1/\sqrt d.$ Nevertheless the use of two-frequencies provides a significant improvement in the degree of squeezing attainable as we show by quantitative analysis of non-resonant probing on the Cs D1 line. Two alternative configurations are analyzed: a Mach-Zehnder interferometer that uses spatial interference, and an interaction with multi-frequency amplitude modulated light that does not require a spatial interferometer. 
0808.00517	Stellar kinematics in double-barred galaxies: the sigma-hollows	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. de Lorenzo-Cáceres (1), J. Falcón-Barroso (2), A. Vazdekis (1), I. Martínez-Valpuesta (1) ((1) Instituto de Astrof\'isica de Canarias, (2) ESA/ESTEC)    	Abstract:  We present SAURON integral-field stellar velocity and velocity dispersion maps for four double-barred early-type galaxies: NGC2859, NGC3941, NGC4725 and NGC5850. The presence of the inner bar does not produce major changes in the line-of-sight velocity, but it appears to have an important effect in the stellar velocity dispersion maps: we find two sigma-hollows of amplitudes between 10 and 40 km/s on either side of the center, at the ends of the inner bars. We have performed numerical simulations to explain these features. Ruling out other possibilities, we conclude that the sigma-hollows are an effect of the contrast between two kinematically different components: the high velocity dispersion of the bulge and the more ordered motion (low velocity dispersion) of the inner bar. 
0808.00518	Building a terminology network for search: the KoMoHe project	Digital Libraries (cs.DL)	Authors:Philipp Mayr, Vivien Petras	Abstract:  The paper reports about results on the GESIS-IZ project "Competence Center Modeling and Treatment of Semantic Heterogeneity" (KoMoHe). KoMoHe supervised a terminology mapping effort, in which 'cross-concordances' between major controlled vocabularies were organized, created and managed. In this paper we describe the establishment and implementation of cross-concordances for search in a digital library (DL). 
0808.00519	Exploring a New Population of Compact Objects: X-ray and IR Observations of the Galactic Centre	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Reba M. Bandyopadhyay, Andrew J. Gosling, Stephen E. Eikenberry, Michael P. Muno, Katherine M. Blundell, Philipp Podsiadlowski, Valerie J. Mikles, Curtis DeWitt	Abstract:  I describe the IR and X-ray observational campaign we have undertaken for the purpose of determining the nature of the faint discrete X-ray source population discovered by Chandra in the Galactic Center (GC). Data obtained for this project includes a deep Chandra survey of the Galactic Bulge; deep, high resolution IR imaging from VLT/ISAAC, CTIO/ISPI, and the UKIDSS Galactic Plane Survey (GPS); and IR spectroscopy from VLT/ISAAC and IRTF/SpeX. By cross-correlating the GC X-ray imaging from Chandra with our IR surveys, we identify candidate counterparts to the X-ray sources via astrometry. Using a detailed IR extinction map, we are deriving magnitudes and colors for all the candidates. Having thus established a target list, we will use the multi-object IR spectrograph FLAMINGOS-2 on Gemini-South to carry out a spectroscopic survey of the candidate counterparts, to search for emission line signatures which are a hallmark of accreting binaries. By determining the nature of these X-ray sources, this FLAMINGOS-2 Galactic Center Survey will have a dramatic impact on our knowledge of the Galactic accreting binary population. 
0808.00520	Phase Transition in Heisenberg Stacked Triangular Antiferromagnets: End of a Controversy	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:V. Thanh Ngo, H. T. Diep	Abstract:  By using the Wang-Landau flat-histogram Monte Carlo (MC) method for very large lattice sizes never simulated before, we show that the phase transition in the frustrated Heisenberg stacked triangular antiferromagnet is of first-order, contrary to results of earlier MC simulations using old-fashioned methods. Our result lends support to the conclusion of a nonperturbative renormalization group performed on an effective Hamiltonian. It puts an end to a 20-year long controversial issue. 
0808.00521	Logics for the Relational Syllogistic	Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)	Authors:Ian Pratt-Hartmann, Lawrence S. Moss	Abstract:  The Aristotelian syllogistic cannot account for the validity of many inferences involving relational facts. In this paper, we investigate the prospects for providing a relational syllogistic. We identify several fragments based on (a) whether negation is permitted on all nouns, including those in the subject of a sentence; and (b) whether the subject noun phrase may contain a relative clause. The logics we present are extensions of the classical syllogistic, and we pay special attention to the question of whether reductio ad absurdum is needed. Thus our main goal is to derive results on the existence (or non-existence) of syllogistic proof systems for relational fragments. We also determine the computational complexity of all our fragments. 
0808.00522	Diversity-induced resonance in a model for opinion formation	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:Claudio J. Tessone, Raul Toral	Abstract:  We study an opinion formation model that takes into account that individuals have diverse preferences when forming their opinion regarding a particular issue. We show that the system exhibits a phenomenon called "diversity-induced resonance"[Tessone et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 194101 (2006)], by which an external influence (for example advertising, or fashion trends) is better followed by populations having the right degree of diversity in their preferences, rather than others where the individuals are identical or have too different preferences. We support our findings by numerical simulations of the model and a mean-field type analytical theory. 
0808.00523	Differentiating unparticles from extra dimensions via mini black hole thermodynamics	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:J. R. Mureika	Abstract:  A simple method for differentiating two similar accelerator-based black hole creation mechanisms -- compactified extra dimensions and unparticle-enhanced gravity -- is discussed, in light of several properties of black hole thermodynamics. The real-valued scaling dimension $\du$ will induce interactions that mimic those in a universe with $(2\du-2)$-extra spatial dimensions, and thus provides an alternative mechanism for black hole creation at the LHC within the confines of standard 4D general relativity. This results in mass-dependent Hawking temperature profiles that depend primarily on $\du$, yielding an evaporation signature unique to the framework. Specifically, a precision reconstruction of the Hawking temperature spectrum morphology for black holes of mass $\Mbh$ yields conclusive evidence of one mechanism over the other, due to the presence of additional adjustable parameters in the unparticle sector. 
0808.00524	Population III Supernovae and the Assembly of the First Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Daniel Whalen, Bob Van Veelen, Brian W. O'Shea, Michael L. Norman	Abstract:  Current numerical studies suggest that the first galaxies formed a few stars at a time and were enriched only gradually by the first heavy elements. However, the large box sizes in these models cannot resolve primordial supernova explosions or the mixing of their metals with ambient gas, which could result in intervening, prompt generations of low-mass stars. We present multiscale 1D models of Population III supernovae in cosmological halos that evolve the blast from its earliest stages as a free expansion. We find that if the star ionizes the halo, the ejecta strongly interacts with the dense shell swept up by the H II region, potentially cooling and fragmenting it into clumps that are unstable to gravitational collapse. If the star fails to ionize the halo, the explosion propagates metals out to 20 - 40 pc and then collapses, enriching tens of thousands of solar masses of primordial gas, in contrast to previous models that suggest such explosions 'fizzle'. Rapid formation of low-mass stars trapped in the gravitational potential well of the halo appears to be inevitable in such circumstances. Consequently, it is possible that far more stars were swept up into the first galaxies, at earlier times and with distinct chemical signatures, than in present models. Upcoming measurements by JWST and ALMA may discriminate between these two paradigms. 
0808.00525	L^1 Ergodic Theorems for Random Group Averages	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Patrick LaVictoire	Abstract:  This is an earlier, but more general, version of "An L^1 Ergodic Theorem for Sparse Random Subsequences". We prove an L^1 ergodic theorem for averages defined by independent random selector variables, in a setting of general measure-preserving group actions. A far more readable version of this paper is in the works. 
0808.00526	Discovery of Eclipsing Binary Central Stars in the Planetary Nebulae M 3-16, H 2-29 and M 2-19	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:B. Miszalski, A. Acker, A.F.J. Moffat, Q.A. Parker, A. Udalski	Abstract:  Progress in understanding the formation and evolution of planetary nebulae (PN) has been restricted by a paucity of well-determined central star masses. To address this deficiency we aim to (i) significantly increase the number of known eclipsing binary central stars of PN (CSPN), and subsequently (ii) directly obtain their masses and absolute dimensions by combining their light-curve parameters with planned radial velocity data. Using photometric data from the third phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) we have searched for periodic variability in a large sample of PN towards the Galactic Bulge using Fourier and phase-dispersion minimisation techniques. Among some dozen periodically variable CSPN found, we report here on three new eclipsing binaries: M 3-16, H 2-29 and M 2-19. We present images, confirmatory spectroscopy and light-curves of the systems. 
0808.00527	Short Pulse Dynamics in Strongly Nonlinear Dissipative Granular Chains	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Alexandre Rosas, Aldo H. Romero, Vitali F. Nesterenko, Katja Lindenberg	Abstract:  We study the energy decay properties of a pulse propagating in a strongly nonlinear granular chain with damping proportional to the relative velocity of the grains. We observe a wave disturbance that at low viscosities consists of two parts exhibiting two entirely different time scales of dissipation. One part is an attenuating solitary wave, is dominated by discreteness and nonlinearity effects as in a dissipationless chain, and has the shorter lifetime. The other is a purely dissipative shocklike structure with a much longer lifetime and exists only in the presence of dissipation. The range of viscosities and initial configurations that lead to this complex wave disturbance are explored. 
0808.00528	Measurement of the Branching Fractions of Bbar -> D** l^- nubar_l Decays in Events Tagged by a Fully Reconstructed B Meson	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We report a measurement of the branching fractions of Bbar -> D** l^- nubar_l decays based on 417 fb-1 of data collected at the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II e+e- storage rings. Events are selected by fully reconstructing one of the B mesons in a hadronic decay mode. A fit to the invariant mass differences m(D(*)pi)-m(D(*)) is performed to extract the signal yields of the different D** states. We observe the Bbar -> D** l^- nubar_l decay modes corresponding to the four D** states predicted by Heavy Quark Symmetry with a significance greater than six standard deviations including systematic uncertainties. 
0808.00529	Rate dependent shear bands in a shear transformation zone model of amorphous solids	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:M. L. Manning, E. G. Daub, J. S. Langer, J. M. Carlson	Abstract:  We use Shear Transformation Zone (STZ) theory to develop a deformation map for amorphous solids as a function of the imposed shear rate and initial material preparation. The STZ formulation incorporates recent simulation results [Haxton and Liu, PRL 99 195701 (2007)] showing that the steady state effective temperature is rate dependent. The resulting model predicts a wide range of deformation behavior as a function of the initial conditions, including homogeneous deformation, broad shear bands, extremely thin shear bands, and the onset of material failure. In particular, the STZ model predicts homogeneous deformation for shorter quench times and lower strain rates, and inhomogeneous deformation for longer quench times and higher strain rates. The location of the transition between homogeneous and inhomogeneous flow on the deformation map is determined in part by the steady state effective temperature, which is likely material dependent. This model also suggests that material failure occurs due to a runaway feedback between shear heating and the local disorder, and provides an explanation for the thickness of shear bands near the onset of material failure. We find that this model, which resolves dynamics within a sheared material interface, predicts that the stress weakens with strain much more rapidly than a similar model which uses a single state variable to specify internal dynamics on the interface. 
0808.00530	Matrix Models for the Black Hole Information Paradox	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Norihiro Iizuka, Takuya Okuda, Joseph Polchinski	Abstract:  We study various matrix models with a charge-charge interaction as toy models of the gauge dual of the AdS black hole. These models show a continuous spectrum and power-law decay of correlators at late time and infinite N, implying information loss in this limit. At finite N, the spectrum is discrete and correlators have recurrences, so there is no information loss. We study these models by a variety of techniques, such as Feynman graph expansion, loop equations, and sum over Young tableaux, and we obtain explicitly the leading 1/N^2 corrections for the spectrum and correlators. These techniques are suggestive of possible dual bulk descriptions. At fixed order in 1/N^2 the spectrum remains continuous and no recurrence occurs, so information loss persists. However, the interchange of the long-time and large-N limits is subtle and requires further study. 
0808.00531	Nonmesonic weak decay spectra of $^4_Λ$He	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:E. Bauer, A. P. Galeao, M. S. Hussein, F. Krmpotic, J. D. Parker	Abstract:  To comprehend the recent Brookhaven National Laboratory experiment E788 on $^4_Λ$He, we have outlined a simple theoretical framework, based on the independent-particle shell model, for the one-nucleon-induced nonmesonic weak decay spectra. Basically, the shapes of all the spectra are tailored by the kinematics of the corresponding phase space, depending very weakly on the dynamics, which is gauged here by the one-meson-exchange-potential. In spite of the straightforwardness of the approach a good agreement with data is acheived. This might be an indication that the final-state-interactions and the two-nucleon induced processes are not very important in the decay of this hypernucleus. We have also found that the $π+K$ exchange potential with soft vertex-form-factor cutoffs $(Λ_π\approx 0.7$ GeV, $Λ_K \approx 0.9$ GeV), is able to account simultaneously for the available experimental data related to $Γ_p$ and $Γ_n$ for $^4_Λ$H, $^4_Λ$He, and $^5_Λ$He. 
0808.00532	On the calculation rule of probability of relativistic free particle in quantum mechanics	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:T. Mei	Abstract:  As is well known, in quantum mechanics, the calculation rule of the probability that an eigen-value a_n is observed when the physical quantity A is measured for a state described by the state vector |> is P(a_n)=<|A_n><A_n|> . However, in Ref.[1], based on strict logical reasoning and mathematical calculation, it has been pointed out, replacing <|A_n><A_n|>, one should use a new rule to calculate P(a_n) for particle satisfying the Dirac equation. In this paper, we first state some results given by Ref.[1]. And then, we present a proof for the new calculation rule of probability according to Dirac sea of negative energy particles, hole theory and the principle "the vacuum is not observable". Finally, we discuss simply the case of particle satisfying the Klein-Gordon equation. 
0808.00533	Model independent results for nucleon structure	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Gerald A Miller	Abstract:  I review recent results regarding the nucleon charge and magnetization densities as well as the shape of the nucleon. First, some phenomenolgical considerations that show that the shape of the proton is not round are discussed. Then model independent results regarding the neutron and proton charge density, and the proton magnetization density are presented. Finally, I show how the spin-dependent densities that reveal the shape of the proton can be measured via their relation with transverse momentum distributions. The present work is made possible by the recent tremendous experimental progress made at Bates, Mainz and Jefferson Laboratory. 
0808.00534	Combined CDF and Dzero Upper Limits on Standard Model Higgs Boson Production at High Mass (155-200 GeV/c2) with 3 fb-1 of data	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Tevatron New Phenomena, Higgs working group, CDF Collaboration, D0 Collaboration	Abstract:  We combine results from CDF and DO searches for a standard model Higgs boson in ppbar collisions at the Fermilab Tevatron, at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. With 3.0 fb-1 of data analyzed at CDF, and at DO, the 95% C.L. upper limits on Higgs boson production are a factor of 1.2, 1.0 and 1.3 higher than the SM cross section for a Higgs boson mass of m_{H}=$165, 170 and 175 GeV, respectively. We exclude at 95% C.L. a standard model Higgs boson of m_H=170 GeV. Based on simulation, the ratios of the corresponding median expected upper limit to the Standard Model cross section are 1.2, 1.4 and 1.7. Compared to the previous Higgs Tevatron combination, more data and refined analysis techniques have been used. These results extend significantly the individual limits of each experiment and provide new knowledge on the mass of the standard model Higgs boson beyond the LEP direct searches. 
0808.00535	Partial choice functions for families of finite sets	Logic (math.LO)	Authors:Eric J. Hall, Saharon Shelah	Abstract:  Let m>2 be an integer. We show that ZF + "For every integer n, Every countable family of non-empty sets of cardinality at most n has an infinite partial choice function" is not strong enough to prove that every countable set of m-element sets has a choice function. In the case where m=p is prime, to obtain the independence result we make use of a permutation model in which the set of atoms has the structure of a vector space over the field of p elements. When m is non-prime, a suitable permutation model is built from the models used in the prime cases. 
0808.00536	Reshape the perfect electrical conductor cylinder at will	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Huanyang Chen, Xiaohe Zhang, Xudong Luo, Hongru Ma, C.T. Chan	Abstract:  A general method is proposed to design the cylindrical cloak, concentrator and superscatterer with arbitrary cross section. The method is demonstrated by the design of a perfect electrical conductor (PEC) reshaper which is able to reshape a PEC cylinder arbitrarily by combining the concept of cloak, concentrator and superscatterer together. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate its properties. 
0808.00537	N=2,4 Supersymmetric Gauge Field Theory in 2T-physics	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Itzhak Bars, Yueh-Cheng Kuo	Abstract:  In the context of Two Time Physics in 4+2 dimensions we construct the most general N=2,4 supersymmetric Yang Mills gauge theories for any gauge group G. This builds on our previous work for N=1 supersymmetry. The action, the conserved SUSY currents, and the off-shell SU(N) covariant SUSY transformation laws are presented for both N=2 and N=4. The on-shell SUSY transformations close to the supergroup SU(2,2$|$N) with N=1,2,4. The SU(2,2)=SO(4,2) sub-symmetry is realized linearly on 4+2 dimensional flat spacetime. All fields, including vectors and spinors, are in 4+2 dimensions. The extra gauge symmetries in 2T field theory, together with the kinematic constraints that follow from the action, remove all the ghosts to give a unitary theory. By choosing gauges and solving the kinematic equations, the 2T field theory in 4+2 flat spacetime can be reduced to various shadows in various 3+1 dimensional (generally curved) spacetimes. These shadows are related to each other by dualities. The conformal shadows of our theories in flat 3+1 dimensions coincide with the well known counterpart N=1,2,4 supersymmetric massless renormalizable field theories in 3+1 dimensions. It is expected that our more symmetric new structures in 4+2 spacetime may be useful for non-perturbative or exact solutions of these theories. 
0808.00538	Electric-Field-Induced Nuclear Spin Resonance Mediated by Oscillating Electron Spin Domains in GaAs-Based Semiconductors	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:N. Kumada, T. Kamada, S. Miyashita, Y. Hirayama, T. Fujisawa	Abstract:  We demonstrate an alternative nuclear spin resonance using radio frequency (RF) electric field (nuclear electric resonance: NER) instead of magnetic field. The NER is based on the electronic control of electron spins forming a domain structure. The RF electric field applied to a gate excites spatial oscillations of the domain walls and thus temporal oscillations of the hyperfine field to nuclear spins. The RF power and burst duration dependence of the NER spectrum provides insight into the interplay between nuclear spins and the oscillating domain walls. 
0808.00539	Galaxy Groups in the SDSS DR4: III. the luminosity and stellar mass functions	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Xiaohu Yang (SHAO), H.J. Mo (UMass), Frank C. van den Bosch (MPIA)    	Abstract:  Using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4 (SDSS DR4) with an adaptive halo-based group finder, we investigate the luminosity and stellar mass functions for different populations of galaxies (central versus satellite; red versus blue; and galaxies in groups of different masses) and for groups themselves. The conditional stellar mass function (CSMF), which describes the stellar distribution of galaxies in halos of a given mass for central and satellite galaxies can be well modeled with a log-normal distribution and a modified Schechter form, respectively. On average, there are about 3 times as many central galaxies as satellites. Among the satellite population, there are in general more red galaxies than blue ones. For the central population, the luminosity function is dominated by red galaxies at the massive end, and by blue galaxies at the low mass end. At the very low-mass end ($M_\ast \la 10^9 h^{-2}\Msun$), however, there is a marked increase in the number of red centrals. We speculate that these galaxies are located close to large halos so that their star formation is truncated by the large-scale environments. The stellar-mass function of galaxy groups is well described by a double power law, with a characteristic stellar mass at $\sim 4\times 10^{10}h^{-2}\Msun$. Finally, we use the observed stellar mass function of central galaxies to constrain the stellar mass - halo mass relation for low mass halos, and obtain $M_{\ast, c}\propto M_h^{4.9}$ for $M_h \ll 10^{11} \msunh$. 
0808.00540	Executable Set Theory and Arithmetic Encodings in Prolog	Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)	Authors:Paul Tarau	Abstract:  The paper is organized as a self-contained literate Prolog program that implements elements of an executable finite set theory with focus on combinatorial generation and arithmetic encodings. The complete Prolog code is available at this http URL . First, ranking and unranking functions for some "mathematically elegant" data types in the universe of Hereditarily Finite Sets with Urelements are provided, resulting in arithmetic encodings for powersets, hypergraphs, ordinals and choice functions. After implementing a digraph representation of Hereditarily Finite Sets we define {\em decoration functions} that can recover well-founded sets from encodings of their associated acyclic digraphs. We conclude with an encoding of arbitrary digraphs and discuss a concept of duality induced by the set membership relation. In the process, we uncover the surprising possibility of internally sharing isomorphic objects, independently of their language level types and meanings. 
0808.00541	The black hole fundamental plane: revisit with a larger sample of radio and X-ray emitting broad-line AGNs	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Zhao-Yu Li, Xue-Bing Wu, Ran Wang	Abstract:  We use a recently released SDSS catalog of X-ray emitting AGNs in conjunction with the FIRST 20cm radio survey to investigate the black hole fundamental plane relationship between the 1.4GHz radio luminosity ($L_r$), 0.1-2.4 keV X-ray luminosity ($L_X$), and the black hole mass ($M$), namely, $log L_r=ξ_{RX}log L_X+ξ_{RM}log M +const$. For this purpose, we have compiled a large sample of 725 broad-line AGNs, which consists of 498 radio-loud sources and 227 radio-quiet sources. Our results are generally consistent with those in our previous work based on a smaller sample of 115 SDSS AGNs. We confirm that radio-loud objects have a steeper slope ($ξ_{RX}$) in the radio-X-ray relationship with respect to radio-quiet objects, and the dependence of the black hole fundamental plane on the black hole mass ($ξ_{RM}$) is weak. We also find a tight correlation with a similar slope between the soft X-ray luminosity and broad emission line luminosity for both radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs, which implies that their soft X-ray emission is unbeamed and probably related to the accretion process. With the current larger sample of AGNs, we are able to study the redshift evolution of the black hole fundamental plane relation for both radio-loud and radio-quiet subsamples. We find that there is no clear evidence of evolution for radio-quiet AGNs, while for radio-loud ones there is a weak trend where $ξ_{RM}$ decreases as the redshift increases. This may be understood in part as due to the observed evolution of the radio spectral index as a function of redshift. Finally, we discuss the relativistic beaming effect and some other uncertainties related to the black hole fundamental plane (Abridged). 
0808.00542	Evolution to a smooth universe in an ekpyrotic contracting phase with w > 1	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:David Garfinkle, Woei Chet Lim, Frans Pretorius, Paul J. Steinhardt	Abstract:  A period of slow contraction with equation of state w > 1, known as an ekpyrotic phase, has been shown to flatten and smooth the universe if it begins the phase with small perturbations. In this paper, we explore how robust and powerful the ekpyrotic smoothing mechanism is by beginning with highly inhomogeneous and anisotropic initial conditions and numerically solving for the subsequent evolution of the universe. Our studies, based on a universe with gravity plus a scalar field with a negative exponential potential, show that some regions become homogeneous and isotropic while others exhibit inhomogeneous and anisotropic behavior in which the scalar field behaves like a fluid with w=1. We find that the ekpyrotic smoothing mechanism is robust in the sense that the ratio of the proper volume of the smooth to non-smooth region grows exponentially fast along time slices of constant mean curvature. 
0808.00543	The effect of two-temperature post-shock accretion flow on the linear polarization pulse in magnetic cataclysmic variables	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Gordon E. Sarty, Curtis J. Saxton, Kinwah Wu	Abstract:  The temperatures of electrons and ions in the post-shock accretion region of a magnetic cataclysmic variable (mCV) will be equal at sufficiently high mass flow rates or for sufficiently weak magnetic fields. At lower mass flow rates or in stronger magnetic fields, efficient cyclotron cooling will cool the electrons faster than the electrons can cool the ions and a two-temperature flow will result. Here we investigate the differences in polarized radiation expected from mCV post-shock accretion columns modeled with one- and two-temperature hydrodynamics. In an mCV model with one accretion region, a magnetic field >~30 MG and a specific mass flow rate of ~0.5 g/cm/cm/s, along with a relatively generic geometric orientation of the system, we find that in the ultraviolet either a single linear polarization pulse per binary orbit or two pulses per binary orbit can be expected, depending on the accretion column hydrodynamic structure (one- or two-temperature) modeled. Under conditions where the physical flow is two-temperature, one pulse per orbit is predicted from a single accretion region where a one-temperature model predicts two pulses. The intensity light curves show similar pulse behavior but there is very little difference between the circular polarization predictions of one- and two-temperature models. Such discrepancies indicate that it is important to model some aspect of two-temperature flow in indirect imaging procedures, like Stokes imaging, especially at the edges of extended accretion regions, were the specific mass flow is low, and especially for ultraviolet data.

Furthermore, we can obtain the number of available sequences for a given maximum magnitude of the cross-correlation function and the sequence length. 
0808.00545	Colossal enhancement of upper critical fields in noncentrosymmetric heavy fermion superconductors near quantum criticality: CeRhSi$_3$ and CeIrSi$_3$	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Y. Tada, N. Kawakami, S. Fujimoto	Abstract:  Strong coupling effects on the upper critical fields $H_{c2}$ along the c-axis in the noncentrosymmetric heavy fermion superconductors near quantum criticality CeRhSi$_3$ and CeIrSi$_3$ are examined. For sufficiently large spin-orbit interactions due to the lack of inversion symmetry, $H_{c2}$ is mainly determined by the orbital depairing effects. From microscopic calculations taking into account the strong spin fluctuations, we show that $H_{c2}$ is extremely enhanced as the system approaches the quantum critical point, resulting in $H_{c2}\sim 30$T even in the case with the low transition temperature $T_c(H=0)\sim 1$K, which well explains the huge $H_{c2}$ observed in the recent experiments. Our results reveal intrinsic and universal properties common to strong coupling superconductivity caused by spin fluctuations near quantum criticality. 
0808.00546	Astrometry of H$_{2}$O Masers in Nearby Star-Forming Regions with VERA. III. IRAS 22198+6336 in L1204G	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Tomoya Hirota, Kazuma Ando, Takeshi Bushimata, Yoon Kyung Choi, Mareki Honma, Hiroshi Imai, Kenzaburo Iwadate, Takaaki Jike, Seiji Kameno, Osamu Kameya, Ryuichi Kamohara, Yukitoshi Kan-ya, Noriyuki Kawaguchi, Masachika Kijima, Mi Kyoung Kim, Hideyuki Kobayashi, Seisuke Kuji, Tomoharu Kurayama, Seiji Manabe, Makoto Matsui, Naoko Matsumoto, Takeshi Miyaji, Atsushi Miyazaki, Takumi Nagayama, Akiharu Nakagawa, Daichi Namikawa, Daisuke Nyu, Chung Sik Oh, Toshihiro Omodaka, Tomoaki Oyama, Satoshi Sakai, Tetsuo Sasao, Katsuhisa Sato, Mayumi Sato, Katsunori M. Shibata, Yoshiaki Tamura, Kosuke Ueda, Kazuyoshi Yamashita	Abstract:  We present results of multi-epoch VLBI observations with VERA (VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry) of the 22 GHz H$_{2}$O masers associated with a young stellar object (YSO) IRAS 22198+6336 in a dark cloud L1204G. Based on the phase-referencing VLBI astrometry, we derive an annual parallax of IRAS 22198+6336 to be 1.309$\pm$0.047 mas, corresponding to the distance of 764$\pm$27 pc from the Sun. Although the most principal error source of our astrometry is attributed to the internal structure of the maser spots, we successfully reduce the errors in the derived annual parallax by employing the position measurements for all of the 26 detected maser spots. Based on this result, we reanalyze the spectral energy distribution (SED) of IRAS 22198+6336 and find that the bolometric luminosity and total mass of IRAS 22198+6336 are 450$L_{\odot}$ and 7$M_{\odot}$, respectively. These values are consistent with an intermediate-mass YSO deeply embedded in the dense dust core, which has been proposed to be an intermediate-mass counterpart of a low-mass Class 0 source. In addition, we obtain absolute proper motions of the H$_{2}$O masers for the most blue-shifted components. We propose that the collimated jets aligned along the east-west direction are the most plausible explanation for the origin of the detected maser features. 
0808.00547	On the union stabilization of two Heegaard splittings	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Jung Hoon Lee	Abstract:  Let two Heegaard splittings $V_1 \cup W_1$ and $V_2 \cup W_2$ of a 3-manifold $M$ be given. We consider the union stabilization $M=V \cup W$ which is a common stabilization of $V_1 \cup W_1$ and $V_2 \cup W_2$ having the property that $V=V_1 \cup V_2$. We show that any two Heegaard splittings of a 3-manifold have a union stabilization. We also give some examples with numerical bounds on the minimal genus of union stabilization. On the other hand, we give an example of a candidate for which the minimal genus of union stabilization is strictly larger than the usual stable genus -- the minimal genus of common stabilization. 
0808.00548	How could the replica method improve accuracy of performance assessment of channel coding?	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Yoshiyuki Kabashima	Abstract:  We explore the relation between the techniques of statistical mechanics and information theory for assessing the performance of channel coding. We base our study on a framework developed by Gallager in {\em IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory} {\bf 11}, 3 (1965), where the minimum decoding error probability is upper-bounded by an average of a generalized Chernoff's bound over a code ensemble. We show that the resulting bound in the framework can be directly assessed by the replica method, which has been developed in statistical mechanics of disordered systems, whereas in Gallager's original methodology further replacement by another bound utilizing Jensen's inequality is necessary. Our approach associates a seemingly {\em ad hoc} restriction with respect to an adjustable parameter for optimizing the bound with a phase transition between two replica symmetric solutions, and can improve the accuracy of performance assessments of general code ensembles including low density parity check codes, although its mathematical justification is still open.

0808.00550	Effect of Quantum Point Contact Measurement on Electron Spin State in Quantum Dot	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Fei-Yun Zhu, Zhi-Cheng Zhu, Tao Tu, Hua Tu, Guang-Can Guo, Guo-Ping Guo	Abstract:  We study the time evolution of two electron spin states in a double quantum-dot system, which includes a nearby quantum point contact (QPC) as a measurement device. We obtain that the QPC measurement induced decoherence is in time scales of microsecond. We also find that the enhanced QPC measurement will trap the system in its initial spin states, which is consistent with quantum Zeno effect. 
0808.00551	Demonstration of a quantum nondemolition sum gate	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Jun-ichi Yoshikawa, Yoshichika Miwa, Alexander Huck, Ulrik L. Andersen, Peter van Loock, Akira Furusawa	Abstract:  The sum gate is the canonical two-mode gate for universal quantum computation based on continuous quantum variables. It represents the natural analogue to a qubit C-NOT gate. In addition, the continuous-variable gate describes a quantum nondemolition (QND) interaction between the quadrature components of two light fields. We experimentally demonstrate a QND sum gate, employing the scheme by R. Filip, P. Marek, and U.L. Andersen [\pra {\bf 71}, 042308 (2005)], solely based on offline squeezed states, homodyne measurements, and feedforward. The results are verified by simultaneously satisfying the criteria for QND measurements in both conjugate quadratures. 
0808.00552	Conformal harmonic forms, Branson-Gover operators and Dirichlet problem at infinity	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Erwann Aubry (JAD), Colin Guillarmou (JAD)    	Abstract:  For odd dimensional Poincaré-Einstein manifolds $(X^{n+1},g)$, we study the set of harmonic $k$-forms (for $k<\ndemi$) which are $C^m$ (with $m\in\nn$) on the conformal compactification $\bar{X}$ of $X$. This is infinite dimensional for small $m$ but it becomes finite dimensional if $m$ is large enough, and in one-to-one correspondence with the direct sum of the relative cohomology $H^k(\bar{X},\pl\bar{X})$ and the kernel of the Branson-Gover \cite{BG} differential operators $(L_k,G_k)$ on the conformal infinity $(\pl\bar{X},[h_0])$. In a second time we relate the set of $C^{n-2k+1}(Λ^k(\bar{X}))$ forms in the kernel of $d+δ_g$ to the conformal harmonics on the boundary in the sense of \cite{BG}, providing some sort of long exact sequence adapted to this setting. This study also provides another construction of Branson-Gover differential operators, including a parallel construction of the generalization of $Q$ curvature for forms. 
0808.00553	Cold streams in early massive hot haloes as the main mode of galaxy formation	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Dekel, Y. Birnboim, G. Engel, J. Freundlich, T. Goerdt, M. Mumcuoglu, E. Neistein, C. Pichon, R. Teyssier, E. Zinger	Abstract:  The massive galaxies in the young universe, ten billion years ago, formed stars at surprising intensities. Although this is commonly attributed to violent mergers, the properties of many of these galaxies are incompatible with such events, showing gas-rich, clumpy, extended rotating disks not dominated by spheroids (Genzel et al. 2006, 2008). Cosmological simulations and clustering theory are used to explore how these galaxies acquired their gas. Here we report that they are stream-fed galaxies, formed from steady, narrow, cold gas streams that penetrate the shock-heated media of massive dark matter haloes (Dekel & Birnboim 2006; Keres et al. 2005). A comparison with the observed abundance of star-forming galaxies implies that most of the input gas must rapidly convert to stars. One-third of the stream mass is in gas clumps leading to mergers of mass ratio greater than 1:10, and the rest is in smoother flows. With a merger duy cycle of 0.1, three-quarters of the galaxies forming stars at a given rate are fed by smooth streams. The rarer, submillimetre galaxies that form stars even more intensely are largely merger-induced starbursts. Unlike destructive mergers, the streams are likely to keep the rotating disk configuration intact, although turbulent and broken into giant star-forming clumps that merge into a central spheroid (Noguchi 1999; Genzel et al. 2008, Elmegreen, Bournaud & Elmegreen 2008, Dekel, Sari & Ceverino 2009). This stream-driven scenario for the formation of disks and spheroids is an alternative to the merger picture. 
0808.00554	Ranking and Unranking of Hereditarily Finite Functions and Permutations	Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)	Authors:Paul Tarau	Abstract:  Prolog's ability to return multiple answers on backtracking provides an elegant mechanism to derive reversible encodings of combinatorial objects as Natural Numbers i.e. {\em ranking} and {\em unranking} functions. Starting from a generalization of Ackerman's encoding of Hereditarily Finite Sets with Urelements and a novel tupling/untupling operation, we derive encodings for Finite Functions and use them as building blocks for an executable theory of {\em Hereditarily Finite Functions}. The more difficult problem of {\em ranking} and {\em unranking} {\em Hereditarily Finite Permutations} is then tackled using Lehmer codes and factoradics. The paper is organized as a self-contained literate Prolog program available at \url{this http URL} 
0808.00555	Pairing Functions, Boolean Evaluation and Binary Decision Diagrams in Prolog	Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)	Authors:Paul Tarau	Abstract:  A "pairing function" J associates a unique natural number z to any two natural numbers x,y such that for two "unpairing functions" K and L, the equalities K(J(x,y))=x, L(J(x,y))=y and J(K(z),L(z))=z hold. Using pairing functions on natural number representations of truth tables, we derive an encoding for Binary Decision Diagrams with the unique property that its boolean evaluation faithfully mimics its structural conversion to a a natural number through recursive application of a matching pairing function. We then use this result to derive {\em ranking} and {\em unranking} functions for BDDs and reduced BDDs. The paper is organized as a self-contained literate Prolog program, available at this http URL Keywords: logic programming and computational mathematics, pairing/unpairing functions, encodings of boolean functions, binary decision diagrams, natural number representations of truth tables 
0808.00556	Logic Engines as Interactors	Programming Languages (cs.PL)	Authors:Paul Tarau	Abstract:  We introduce a new programming language construct, Interactors, supporting the agent-oriented view that programming is a dialog between simple, self-contained, autonomous building blocks. We define Interactors as an abstraction of answer generation and refinement in Logic Engines resulting in expressive language extension and metaprogramming patterns, including emulation of Prolog's dynamic database. A mapping between backtracking based answer generation in the callee and "forward" recursion in the caller enables interaction between different branches of the callee's search process and provides simplified design patterns for algorithms involving combinatorial generation and infinite answer streams. Interactors extend language constructs like Ruby, Python and C#'s multiple coroutining block returns through yield statements and they can emulate the action of monadic constructs and catamorphisms in functional languages. Keywords: generalized iterators, logic engines, agent oriented programming language constructs, interoperation with stateful objects, metaprogramming 
0808.00557	Four-loop lattice-regularized vacuum energy density of the three-dimensional SU(3) + adjoint Higgs theory	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:F. Di Renzo, M. Laine, Y. Schroder, C. Torrero	Abstract:  The pressure of QCD admits at high temperatures a factorization into purely perturbative contributions from "hard" thermal momenta, and slowly convergent as well as non-perturbative contributions from "soft" thermal momenta. The latter can be related to various effective gluon condensates in a dimensionally reduced effective field theory, and measured there through lattice simulations. Practical measurements of one of the relevant condensates have suffered, however, from difficulties in extrapolating convincingly to the continuum limit. In order to gain insight on this problem, we employ Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory to estimate the problematic condensate up to 4-loop order in lattice perturbation theory. Our results seem to confirm the presence of "large" discretization effects, going like $a\ln(1/a)$, where $a$ is the lattice spacing. For definite conclusions, however, it would be helpful to repeat the corresponding part of our study with standard lattice perturbation theory techniques. 
0808.00558	Communication Through Jamming over a Slotted ALOHA Channel	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Sandeep Bhadra, Shreeshankar Bodas, Sanjay Shakkottai, Sriram Vishwanath	Abstract:  This work derives bounds on the jamming capacity of a slotted ALOHA system. A system with n legitimate users, each with a Bernoulli arrival process is considered. Packets are temporarily stored at the corresponding user queues, and a slotted ALOHA strategy is used for packet transmissions over the shared channel. The scenario considered is that of a pair of illegitimate users that jam legitimate transmissions in order to communicate over the slotted ALOHA channel. Jamming leads to binary signaling between the illegitimate users, with packet collisions due to legitimate users treated as (multiplicative) noise in this channel. Further, the queueing dynamics at the legitimate users stochastically couples the jamming strategy used by the illegitimate users and the channel evolution. By considering various i.i.d. jamming strategies, achievable jamming rates over the slotted ALOHA channel are derived. Further, an upper bound on the jamming capacity over the class of all ergodic jamming policies is derived. These bounds are shown to be tight in the limit where the offered system load approaches unity. 
0808.00559	Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of electron-doped cuprate superconductors: Isotropic electron-phonon coupling	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Seung Ryong Park, D. J. Song, C. S. Leem, Chul Kim, C. Kim, B. J. Kim, H. Eisaki	Abstract:  We have performed high resolution angle resolved photoemission (ARPES) studies on electron doped cuprate superconductors Sm2-xCexCuO4 (x=0.10, 0.15, 0.18), Nd2-xCexCuO4 (x=0.15) and Eu2-xCexCuO4 (x=0.15). Imaginary parts of the electron removal self energy show step-like features due to an electron-bosonic mode coupling. The step-like feature is seen along both nodal and anti-nodal directions but at energies of 50 and 70 meV, respectively, independent of the doping and rare earth element. Such energy scales can be understood as being due to preferential coupling to half- and full-breathing mode phonons, revealing the phononic origin of the kink structures. Estimated electron-phonon coupling constant lambda from the self energy is roughly independent of the doping and momentum. The isotropic nature of lambda is discussed in comparison with the hole doped case where a strong anisotropy exists.

An Extensive Survey for Molecular Outflows	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Satoko Takahashi, Masao Saito, Nagayoshi Ohashi, Nobuhiko Kusakabe, Shigehisa Takakuwa, Yoshito Shimajiri, Motohide Tamura, Ryohei Kawabe	Abstract:  Using the ASTE 10 m submillimeter telescope and the 1.4 m Infrared Survey Facility (IRSF), we performed an extensive outflow survey in the Orion Molecular Cloud -2 and -3 region. Our survey, which includes 41 potential star-forming sites, has been newly compiled using multi-wavelength data based on millimeter- and submillimeter-continuum observations as well as radio continuum observations. From the CO (3-2) observations performed with the ASTE 10 m telescope, we detected 14 CO molecular outflows, seven of which were newly identified. This higher detection rate, as compared to previous CO (1-0) results in the same region, suggests that CO (3-2) may be a better outflow tracer. Physical properties of these outflows and their possible driving sources were derived. Derived parameters were compared with those of CO outflows in low- and high-mass starforming regions. We show that the CO outflow momentum correlates with the bolometric luminosity of the driving source and with the envelope mass, regardless of the mass of the driving sources. In addition to these CO outflows, seven sources having NIR features suggestive of outflows were also identified. 
0808.00562	A light neutralino in hybrid models of supersymmetry breaking	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Emilian Dudas, Stephane Lavignac, Jeanne Parmentier	Abstract:  We show that in gauge mediation models where heavy messenger masses are provided by the adjoint Higgs field of an underlying SU(5) theory, a generalized gauge mediation spectrum arises with the characteristic feature of having a neutralino LSP much lighter than in the standard gauge or gravity mediation schemes. This naturally fits in a hybrid scenario where gravity mediation, while subdominant with respect to gauge mediation, provides mu and Bmu parameters of the appropriate size for electroweak symmetry breaking. 
0808.00563	On the Center of Mass of Isolated Systems with General Asymptotics	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Lan-Hsuan Huang	Abstract:  We propose a definition of center of mass for asymptotically flat manifolds satisfying Regge-Teitelboim condition at infinity. This definition has a coordinate-free expression and natural properties. Furthermore, we prove that our definition is consistent both with the one proposed by Corvino and Schoen and another by Huisken and Yau. The main tool is a new density theorem for data satisfying the Regge-Teitelboim condition. 
0808.00564	A functional of the one-body-reduced density matrix derived from the homogeneous electron gas: Performance for finite systems	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:N. N. Lathiotakis, N. Helbig, A. Zacarias, E.K.U. Gross	Abstract:  An approximation for the exchange-correlation energy of reduced-density-matrix-functional theory was recently derived from a study of the homogeneous electron gas (N.N. Lathiotakis, N. Helbig, E.K.U. Gross, Phys. Rev. B 75, 195120 (2007)). In the present work, we show how this approximation can be extended appropriately to finite systems, where the Wigner Seitz radius r_s, the parameter characterizing the constant density of the electron gas, needs to be replaced. We apply the functional to a variety of molecules at their equilibrium geometry, and also discuss its performance at the dissociation limit. We demonstrate that, although originally derived from the uniform gas, the approximation performs remarkably well for finite systems.

Both ATLAS and CMS have performed studies with simulated data to estimate the expected uncertainty on the production cross section measurements of the three single top processes ($t$-channel, s-channel, $tW$ production) in the first years of LHC operations. Results in the different channels and for the two experiments are reported. 
0808.00566	Complementary optical-potential analysis of alpha-particle elastic scattering and induced reactions at low energies	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:M. Avrigeanu (1), A. C. Obreja (1), F. L. Roman (1), V. Avrigeanu (1), W. von Oertzen (2) ((1) "Horia Hulubei" National Institute for Physics and Nuclear Engineering, Bucharest, (2) Freie Universit\"at Berlin and Hahn-Meitner-Institut, Berlin)    	Abstract:  A previously derived semi-microscopic analysis based on the Double Folding Model, for alpha-particle elastic scattering on A~100 nuclei at energies below 32 MeV, is extended to medium mass A ~ 50-120 nuclei and energies from ~13 to 50 MeV. The energy-dependent phenomenological imaginary part for this semi-microscopic optical model potential was obtained including the dispersive correction to the microscopic real potential, and used within a concurrent phenomenological analysis of the same data basis. A regional parameter set for low-energy alpha-particles entirely based on elastic-scattering data analysis was also obtained for nuclei within the above-mentioned mass and energy ranges. Then, an ultimate assessment of (alpha,gamma), (alpha,n) and (alpha,p) reaction cross sections concerned target nuclei from 45Sc to 118Sn and incident energies below ~12 MeV. The former diffuseness of the real part of optical potential as well as the surface imaginary-potential depth have been found responsible for the actual difficulties in the description of these data, and modified in order to obtain an optical potential which describe equally well both the low energy elastic-scattering and induced-reaction data of alpha-particles. 
0808.00567	Light Bosons of Electromagnetic Field and Breakdown of Relativistic Theory	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:V. N. Minasyan	Abstract:  In our analysis, a quantisation scheme for local electromagnetic waves in vacuum is introduced by the model of nonideal Bose-gas consisting of Bose-light-particles (which are no photons) with spin one and a finite mass. This fact destroys the Relativistic Theory of Einstein as well as displays a wrong sound of so-called a spontaneous breakdown of symmetry because the light boson can be moved by speed of wave in vacuum. 
0808.00568	Idealized glass transitions under pressure: dynamics versus thermodynamics	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Th. Voigtmann	Abstract:  The interplay of slow dynamics and thermodynamic features of dense liquids is studied by examinining how the glass transition changes depending on the presence or absence of Lennard-Jones-like attractions. Quite different thermodynamic behavior leaves the dynamics unchanged, with important consequences for high-pressure experiments on glassy liquids. Numerical results are obtained within mode-coupling theory (MCT), but the qualitative features are argued to hold more generally. A simple square-well model can be used to explain generic features found in experiment.

Garcia-Adeva, Rolindes Balda, Joaquin Fernandez	Abstract:  We report on a novel mechanism for laser cooling of fluorescent solids based on infrared-to-visible upconversion often found in rare-earth-doped low-phonon materials. This type of optical cooling presents some advantages with regards to conventional anti-Stokes cooling. Among them, it allows to obtain cooling in a broader range of frequencies around the barycenter of the infrared emitting band. 
0808.00570	The Connection between Orbits and Isophotal Shape in Elliptical Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Roland Jesseit, Thorsten Naab, Andreas Burkert	Abstract:  We examine the origin of photometrical properties of N-body merger remnants from the perpective of their orbital content. We show that disc mergers alone are unlikely to form a boxy-discy dichotomy in isophotal shape, because of the survival of disc-like orbits even in violent mergers. The shape of the different orbit families can vary strongly, depending on how violent the merger was. Minor axis tubes can become boxy and box orbits can be round. However, for edge-on projections isophotal shape, orbital content and line-of-sight velocity are well connected. 
0808.00571	A Proof of George Andrews' and Dave Robbins' q-TSPP Conjecture (modulo a finite amount of routine calculations)	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Manuel Kauers, Christoph Koutschan, Doron Zeilberger	Abstract:  In the historic conference Combinatoire Enumerative[LL] wonderfully organized by Gilbert Labelle and Pierre Leroux there were many stimulating lectures, including a very interesting one by Pierre Leroux himself, who talked about his joint work with Xavier Viennot[LV], on solving differential equations combinatorially! During the problem session of that very same colloque, chaired by Pierre Leroux, Richard Stanley raised some intriguing problems about the enumeration of plane partitions, that he later expanded into a fascinating article[Sta1]. Most of these problems concerned the enumeration of symmetry classes of plane partitions, that were discussed in more detail in another article of Stanley[Sta2]. All of the conjectures in the latter article have since been proved (see Dave Bressoud's modern classic[B]), except one, that, so far, resisted the efforts of the greatest minds in enumerative combinatorics. It concerns the proof of an explicit formula for the q-enumeration of totally symmetric plane partitions, conjectured independently by George Andrews and Dave Robbins([Sta2],[Sta1](conj. 7), [B](conj. 13)). In this tribute to Pierre Leroux, we describe how to prove that last stronghold. 
0808.00572	Microarrays, Empirical Bayes and the Two-Groups Model	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:Bradley Efron	Abstract:  The classic frequentist theory of hypothesis testing developed by Neyman, Pearson and Fisher has a claim to being the twentieth century's most influential piece of applied mathematics. Something new is happening in the twenty-first century: high-throughput devices, such as microarrays, routinely require simultaneous hypothesis tests for thousands of individual cases, not at all what the classical theory had in mind. In these situations empirical Bayes information begins to force itself upon frequentists and Bayesians alike. The two-groups model is a simple Bayesian construction that facilitates empirical Bayes analysis. This article concerns the interplay of Bayesian and frequentist ideas in the two-groups setting, with particular attention focused on Benjamini and Hochberg's False Discovery Rate method. Topics include the choice and meaning of the null hypothesis in large-scale testing situations, power considerations, the limitations of permutation methods, significance testing for groups of cases (such as pathways in microarray studies), correlation effects, multiple confidence intervals and Bayesian competitors to the two-groups model. 
0808.00573	The dealternating number and the alternation number of a closed 3-braid	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Tetsuya Abe, Kengo Kishimoto	Abstract:  We give an upper bound for the dealternating number of a closed 3-braid. As applications, we determine the dealternating numbers, the alternation numbers and the Turaev genera of some closed positive 3-braids. We also show that there exist infinitely many positive knots with any dealternating number (or any alternation number) and any braid index. 
0808.00574	Hot Subdwarfs in Binaries as the Source of the Far-UV Excess in Elliptical Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Philipp Podsiadlowski (Oxford University), Zhanwen Han (National Astronomical Observatories / Yunnan Observatory), Anthony E. Lynas-Gray (Oxford University), David Brown (Oxford University)    	Abstract:  The excess of far-ultraviolet (far-UV) radiation in elliptical galaxies has remained one of their most enduring puzzles. In contrast, the origin of old blue stars in the Milky Way, hot subdwarfs, is now reasonably well understood: they are hot stars that have lost their hydrogen envelopes by various binary interactions. Here, we review the main evolutionary channels that produce hot subdwarfs in the Galaxy and present the results of binary population synthesis simulations that reproduce the main properties of the Galactic hot-subdwarf population. Applying the same model to elliptical galaxies, we show how this model can explain the main observational properties of the far-UV excess, including the far-UV spectrum, without the need to invoke ad hoc physical processes. The model implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as has been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly dependent on the metallicity of the population. 
0808.00575	Exceptional points in quantum and classical dynamics	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:A.V. Smilga	Abstract:  We notice that, when a quantum system involves exceptional points, i.e. the special values of parameters where the Hamiltonian loses its self-adjointness and acquires the Jordan block structure, the corresponding classical system also exhibits a singular behaviour associated with restructuring of classical trajectories. The system with the crypto-Hermitian Hamiltonian H = (p^2+z^2)/2 -igz^5 and hyper-ellictic classical dynamics is studied in details. Analogies with supersymmetric Yang-Mills dynamics are elucidated. 
0808.00576	Hydrodynamical Adaptive Mesh Refinement Simulations of Disk Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Brad K. Gibson, Stephanie Courty, Patricia Sanchez-Blazquez, Romain Teyssier, Elisa L. House, Chris B. Brook, Daisuke Kawata	Abstract:  To date, fully cosmological hydrodynamic disk simulations to redshift zero have only been undertaken with particle-based codes, such as GADGET, Gasoline, or GCD+. In light of the (supposed) limitations of traditional implementations of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), or at the very least, their respective idiosyncrasies, it is important to explore complementary approaches to the SPH paradigm to galaxy formation. We present the first high-resolution cosmological disk simulations to redshift zero using an adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)-based hydrodynamical code, in this case, RAMSES. We analyse the temporal and spatial evolution of the simulated stellar disks' vertical heating, velocity ellipsoids, stellar populations, vertical and radial abundance gradients (gas and stars), assembly/infall histories, warps/lopsideness, disk edges/truncations (gas and stars), ISM physics implementations, and compare and contrast these properties with our sample of cosmological SPH disks, generated with GCD+. These preliminary results are the first in our long-term Galactic Archaeology Simulation program. 
0808.00577	Stratorotational instability in MHD Taylor-Couette flows	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:G. Ruediger, D.A. Shalybkov	Abstract:  The stability of dissipative Taylor-Couette flows with an axial stable density stratification and a prescribed azimuthal magnetic field is considered. Global nonaxisymmetric solutions of the linearized MHD equations with toroidal magnetic field, axial density stratification and differential rotation are found for both insulating and conducting cylinder walls. Flat rotation laws such as the quasi-Kepler law are unstable against the nonaxisymmetric stratorotational instability (SRI). The influence of a current-free toroidal magnetic field depends on the magnetic Prandtl number Pm: SRI is supported by Pm > 1 and it is suppressed by Pm \lsim 1. For too flat rotation laws a smooth transition exists to the instability which the toroidal magnetic field produces in combination with the differential rotation. This nonaxisymmetric azimuthal magnetorotational instability (AMRI) has been computed under the presence of an axial density gradient. If the magnetic field between the cylinders is not current-free then also the Tayler instability occurs and the transition from the hydrodynamic SRI to the magnetic Tayler instability proves to be rather complex. Most spectacular is the `ballooning' of the stability domain by the density stratification: already a rather small rotation stabilizes magnetic fields against the Tayler instability. An azimuthal component of the resulting electromotive force only exists for density-stratified flows. The related alpha-effect for magnetic SRI of Kepler rotation appears to be positive for negative dρ/dz <0. 
0808.00578	Low-temperature proximity effect in clean metals	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:A. S. Alexandrov, V. V. Kabanov	Abstract:  Theories of proximity effect in layered superconductor-normal metal structures usually deal with a hypothetic normal metal with no interaction between electrons and with finite temperatures often close to the superconductor critical temperature. We present an asymptotic solution of the Gor'kov equations in the opposite low-temperature limit for a clean normal metal with a repulsive interaction between electrons. The order parameter in the metal exhibits a power-law decay, Delta(x) is proportional to 1/x, as a function of the distance from the SN boundary, x, with a proximity length strongly depending on the repulsive interaction. 
0808.00579	Search for B+ meson decay to a1+ K*0	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We present the preliminary result of a search for the decay B+- --> a1+-K*0. The data, collected with the BaBar detector at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, represent 465 million BB pairs produced in e+e- annihilation at the Y(4s) energy. The result for the branching fraction is: B(B+ --> a1+ K*0) * B(a1+ --> pi+pi-pi+) = (0.7 +0.5/-0.4 +/-0.7) x 10-6, corresponding to an upper limit at 90% confidence level of 1.6 x 10-6. The first error quoted is statistical, the second systematic. 
0808.00580	Exact-exchange Kohn-Sham potential, surface energy, and work function of jellium slabs	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:C. M. Horowitz, C. R. Proetto, J. M. Pitarke	Abstract:  Exact-exchange self-consistent calculations of the Kohn-Sham potential, surface energy, and work function of jellium slabs are reported in the framework of the Optimized Effective Potential (OEP) scheme of Density Functional Theory. In the vacuum side of the jellium surface and at a distance $z$ that is larger than the slab thickness, the exchange-only Kohn-Sham potential is found to be image-like ($\sim -e^2/z$) but with a coefficient that differs from that of the classical image potential $V_{im}(z)=-e^2/4z$. The three OEP contributions to the surface energy (kinetic, electrostatic, and exchange) are found to oscillate as a function of the slab thickness, as occurs in the case of the corresponding calculations based on the use of single-particle orbitals and energies obtained in the Local Density Approximation (LDA). The OEP work function presents large quantum size effects that are absent in the LDA and which reflect the intrinsic derivative discontinuity of the exact Kohn-Sham potential. 
0808.00581	Discovery of the Inner Ring around PSR B1509-58	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yoichi Yatsu, Nobuyuki Kawai, Shinpei Shibata, Wolfgang Brinkmann	Abstract:  A Chandra study of pulsar wind nebula around the young energetic pulsar PSR B1509-58 is presented. The high resolution X-ray image with total exposure time of 190 ks reveals a ring like feature 10'' apart from the pulsar. This feature is analogous to the inner ring seen in the Crab nebula and thus may correspond to a wind termination shock. The shock radius enables us to constrain the wind magnetization, sigma>= 0.01. The obtained sigma is one order of magnitude larger than that of the Crab nebula. In the pulsar vicinity, the southern jet appears to extend beyond the wind termination shock, in contrast to the narrow jet of the Crab. The revealed morphology of the broad jet is coincident with the recently proposed theoretical model in which a magnetic hoop stress diverts and squeezes the post-shock equatorial flow towards the poloidal direction generating a jet.

0808.00583	On spatial variations of the electron-to-proton mass ratio in the Milky Way	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S.A. Levshakov, P. Molaro, M.G. Kozlov	Abstract:  (Abridged) Radio-astronomical observations of molecular cores in lines of NH3 (J,K)=(1,1), CCS J_N=2_1-1_0, HC3N J=5-4, and N2H+ J=1-0 are used to measure the relative radial velocity offsets, Delta V, between the NH3 (1,1) and other molecular transitions. Robust statistical analysis is applied to the n=207 individual measurements in the Perseus molecular cloud (PC), the Pipe Nebula (PN), and the infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) to deduce the mean value of Delta V and its uncertainty. The measured values of Delta V from the PC, PN, and IRDCs show statistically significant positive velocity shifts between the line centers of NH3 and other molecules. The most accurate estimates are obtained from subsamples of the NH3/CCS pairs observed in the PC (n=21) and the PN (n=8), Delta V = 36+/-7_stat+/-13.5_sys} m/s and 53+/-11_stat+/-13.5_sys m/s, respectively, and from the n=36 NH3/N2H+ and n=27 NH3/HC3N pairs observed in the IRDCs, Delta V = 148+/-32_stat+/-13.6_sys m/s and 115+/-37_stat+/-31_sys m/s, respectively. Being interpreted in terms of the electron-to-proton mass ratio variation, this gives Delta mu/mu = (4-14)10^{-8}, which is an order of magnitude more sensitive than previous astronomical constraints on this quantity. 
0808.00584	Congestion phenomena on complex networks	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:Daniele De Martino, Luca Dall'Asta, Ginestra Bianconi, Matteo Marsili	Abstract:  We define a minimal model of traffic flows in complex networks containing the most relevant features of real routing schemes, i.e. a trade--off strategy between topological-based and traffic-based routing. The resulting collective behavior, obtained analytically for the ensemble of uncorrelated networks, is physically very rich and reproduces results recently observed in traffic simulations on scale-free networks. We find that traffic control is useless in homogeneous graphs but may improves global performance in inhomogeneous networks, enlarging the free-flow region in parameter space. Traffic control also introduces non-linear effects and, beyond a critical strength, may trigger the appearance of a congested phase in a discontinuous manner. 
0808.00585	Kondo effect in single atom contacts: the importance of the atomic geometry	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Lucia Vitali, Robin Ohmann, Sebastian Stepanow, Pietro Gambardella, Kun Tao, Renzhong Huang, Valeri S. Stepanyuk, Patrick Bruno, Klaus Kern	Abstract:  Co single atom junctions on copper surfaces are studied by scanning tunneling microscopy and ab-initio calculations. The Kondo temperature of single cobalt atoms on the Cu(111) surface has been measured at various tip-sample distances ranging from tunneling to the point contact regime. The experiments show a constant Kondo temperature for a whole range of tip-substrate distances consistently with the predicted energy position of the spin-polarized d-levels of Co. This is in striking difference to experiments on Co/Cu(100) junctions, where a substantial increase of the Kondo temperature has been found. Our calculations reveal that the different behavior of the Co adatoms on the two Cu surfaces originates from the interplay between the structural relaxations and the electronic properties in the near-contact regime. 
0808.00586	Coinductive big-step operational semantics	Programming Languages (cs.PL)	Authors:Xavier Leroy (INRIA Rocquencourt), Hervé Grall (INRIA Rennes, LINA)    	Abstract:  Using a call-by-value functional language as an example, this article illustrates the use of coinductive definitions and proofs in big-step operational semantics, enabling it to describe diverging evaluations in addition to terminating evaluations. We formalize the connections between the coinductive big-step semantics and the standard small-step semantics, proving that both semantics are equivalent. We then study the use of coinductive big-step semantics in proofs of type soundness and proofs of semantic preservation for compilers. A methodological originality of this paper is that all results have been proved using the Coq proof assistant. We explain the proof-theoretic presentation of coinductive definitions and proofs offered by Coq, and show that it facilitates the discovery and the presentation of the results. 
0808.00587	A rotating black lens solution in five dimensions	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Yu Chen, Edward Teo	Abstract:  It has recently been shown that a stationary, asymptotically flat vacuum black hole in five space-time dimensions with two commuting axial symmetries must have an event horizon with either a spherical, ring or lens-space topology. In this paper, we study the third possibility, a so-called black lens with L(n,1) horizon topology. Using the inverse scattering method, we construct a black lens solution with the simplest possible rod structure, and possessing a single asymptotic angular momentum. Its properties are then analysed; in particular, it is shown that there must either be a conical singularity or a naked curvature singularity present in the space-time. 
0808.00588	Spectral estimates for periodic fourth order operators	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Andrey Badanin (ASTU, Arkhangelsk), Evgeny Korotyaev (Cardiff University)    	Abstract:  We consider the operator $H={d^4dt^4}+{ddt}p{ddt}+q$ with 1-periodic coefficients on the real line. The spectrum of $H$ is absolutely continuous and consists of intervals separated by gaps. We describe the spectrum of this operator in terms of the Lyapunov function, which is analytic on a two-sheeted Riemann surface. On each sheet the Lyapunov function has the standard properties of the Lyapunov function for the scalar case. We describe the spectrum of $H$ in terms of periodic, antiperiodic eigenvalues, and so-called resonances. We prove that 1) the spectrum of $H$ at high energy has multiplicity two, 2) the asymptotics of the periodic, antiperiodic eigenvalues and of the resonances are determined at high energy, 3) for some specific $p$ the spectrum of $H$ has an infinite number of gaps, 4) the spectrum of $H$ has small spectral band (near the beginner of the spectrum) with multiplicity 4 and its asymptotics are determined as $p\to 0, q=0$. 
0808.00589	Real-Time Diagrammatic Monte Carlo for Nonequilibrium Quantum Transport	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Marco Schiro`, Michele Fabrizio	Abstract:  We propose a novel approach to nonequilibrium real-time dynamics of quantum impurities models coupled to biased non-interacting leads, such as those relevant to quantum transport in nanoscale molecular devices. The method is based on a Diagrammatic Monte Carlo sampling of the real-time perturbation theory along the Keldysh contour. We benchmark the method on a non-interacting resonant level model and, as a first non-trivial application, we study zero temperature non-equilibrium transport through a vibrating molecule. 
0808.00590	A new mechanism for electron transfer in fast ion-atomic collisions	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:A.B.Voitkiv, B.Najjari, J.Ullrich	Abstract:  We discuss a new mechanism for the electron capture in fast ion-atom collisions. Similarly like in the radiative capture, where the electron transfer occurs due to photon emission, within the mechanism under consideration the electron capture takes place due to the emission of an additional electron. This first order capture process leads to the so called transfer-ionization and has a number of interesting features, in particular, in the target frame it results in the electron emission mainly into the backward semi-sphere. 
0808.00591	The Luminosity Function of Long Gamma-Ray Bursts and their rate at z>6	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:R. Salvaterra, S. Campana, G. Chincarini, T.R. Choudhury, S. Covino, A. Ferrara, S. Gallerani, C. Guidorzi, G. Tagliaferri	Abstract:  We compute the luminosity function (LF) and the formation rate of long gamma ray bursts (GRBs) in three different scenarios: i) GRBs follow the cosmic star formation and their LF is constant in time; ii) GRBs follow the cosmic star formation but the LF varies with redshift; iii) GRBs form preferentially in low-metallicity environments. We then test model predictions against the Swift 3-year data, showing that scenario i) is robustly ruled out. Moreover, we show that the number of bright GRBs detected by Swift suggests that GRBs should have experienced some sort of luminosity evolution with redshift, being more luminous in the past. Finally we propose to use the observations of the afterglow spectrum of GRBs at z>5.5 to constrain the reionization history and we applied our method to the case of GRB 050904. 
0808.00592	Extinction transition on diffusive substrate: a different universality class?	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Galit Evron, David A. Kessler, Nadav M. Shnerb	Abstract:  The extinction transition on a one dimensional heterogeneous substrate with diffusive correlations is studied. Diffusively correlated heterogeneity is shown to affect the location of the transition point, as the reactants adapt to the fluctuating environment. At the transition point the density decays like $t^{-0.159}$, as predicted by the theory of directed percolation. However, the scaling function describing the behavior away from the transition shows significant deviations from the DP predictions; it is suggested, thus, that the off-transition behavior of the system is governed by local adaptation to favored regions.

We track the route of the system towards chaos created by the many-body-induced nonlinearity and show that relevant information can be extracted from an experimentally accessible quantity, the gas mean position. The threshold nonlinearity for the appearance of chaotic behavior is deduced from KAM arguments and agrees with the value obtained by calculating the associated Lyapunov exponent. 
0808.00595	Hysteretic jumps in the response of layered superconductors to electromagnetic fields	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:V.A. Yampol'skii, T.M. Slipchenko, Z.A. Mayzelis, D.V. Kadygrob, S.S. Apostolov, S.E. Savel'ev, Franco Nori	Abstract:  We consider here a layered superconductor subject to an externally applied moderately-strong electromagnetic field. We predict hysteretic jumps in the dependence of the surface reactance of the superconductor on the amplitude of the incident electromagnetic wave. This very unusual nonlinear phenomenon can be observed in thin superconducting slabs at not very strong ac amplitudes, if the frequency of the irradiating field is close to the Josephson plasma frequency. Using the set of coupled sine-Gordon equations, we derive the expression for the phase shift of the reflected wave and obtain the conditions for the appearance of hysteresis. 
0808.00596	On row-by-row coding for 2-D constraints	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Ido Tal, Tuvi Etzion, Ron M. Roth	Abstract:  A constant-rate encoder--decoder pair is presented for a fairly large family of two-dimensional (2-D) constraints. Encoding and decoding is done in a row-by-row manner, and is sliding-block decodable. Essentially, the 2-D constraint is turned into a set of independent and relatively simple one-dimensional (1-D) constraints; this is done by dividing the array into fixed-width vertical strips. Each row in the strip is seen as a symbol, and a graph presentation of the respective 1-D constraint is constructed. The maxentropic stationary Markov chain on this graph is next considered: a perturbed version of the corresponding probability distribution on the edges of the graph is used in order to build an encoder which operates in parallel on the strips. This perturbation is found by means of a network flow, with upper and lower bounds on the flow through the edges. A key part of the encoder is an enumerative coder for constant-weight binary words. A fast realization of this coder is shown, using floating-point arithmetic. 
0808.00597	Comment: Microarrays, Empirical Bayes and the Two-Groups Model	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:Carl N. Morris	Abstract:  Brad Efron's paper [arXiv:0808.0572] has inspired a return to the ideas behind Bayes, frequency and empirical Bayes. The latter preferably would not be limited to exchangeable models for the data and hyperparameters. Parallels are revealed between microarray analyses and profiling of hospitals, with advances suggesting more decision modeling for gene identification also. Then good multilevel and empirical Bayes models for random effects should be sought when regression toward the mean is anticipated. 
0808.00598	Two-qubit analogs of octonions and projective planes	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:A.R.P.Rau	Abstract:  A quantum spin-1/2, and its associated su(2) algebra of Pauli spin matrices are familiarly linked to Clifford algebra and quaternions. Somewhat more loosely, we develop connections between the su(4) algebra of two spins and of its sub-algebras, which are important throughout the field of quantum information, with octonions, the projective plane of seven elements, and entities in projective geometry and design theory called partial Steiner systems of 10 and 15 elements. Although not the exact correspondence between a single spin and quaternions, the close analogy between these geometrical objects and the 15 operators of a two-spin system may be useful to both projective geometry and quantum information.

0808.00600	Entanglement of two blocks of spins in the critical Ising model	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:P. Facchi, G. Florio, C. Invernizzi, S. Pascazio	Abstract:  We compute the entropy of entanglement of two blocks of L spins at a distance d in the ground state of an Ising chain in an external transverse magnetic field. We numerically study the von Neumann entropy for different values of the transverse field. At the critical point we obtain analytical results for blocks of size L=1 and L=2. In the general case, the critical entropy is shown to be additive when d goes to infinity. Finally, based on simple arguments, we derive an expression for the entropy at the critical point as a function of both L and d. This formula is in excellent agreement with numerical results. 
0808.00601	A 3D radiative transfer framework: III. periodic boundary conditions	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Peter H. Hauschildt, E. Baron	Abstract:  We present a general method to solve radiative transfer problems including scattering in the continuum as well as in lines in 3D configurations with periodic boundary conditions. he scattering problem for line transfer is solved via means of an operator splitting (OS) technique. The formal solution is based on a full characteristics method. The approximate $Λ$ operator is constructed considering nearest neighbors exactly. The code is parallelized over both wavelength and solid angle using the MPI library. We present the results of several test cases with different values of the thermalization parameter and two choices for the temperature structure. The results are directly compared to 1D plane parallel tests. The 3D results agree very well with the well-tested 1D calculations.

We study in detail substitution subshifts and we prove these limit laws are piecewise linear functions. The same kind of results is obtained for classical low complexity systems given by non stationary ordered Bratteli diagrams.

0808.00604	Matrix-based approach to electrodynamics in media	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:A.A. Bogush, V.M. Red'kov, N.G. Tokarevskaya, George J. Spix	Abstract:  The Riemann -- Silberstein -- Majorana -- Oppenheimer approach to the Maxwell electrodynamics in presence of electrical sources and arbitrary media is investigated within the matrix formalism. The symmetry of the matrix Maxwell equation under transformations of the complex rotation group SO(3.C) is demonstrated explicitly. In vacuum case, the matrix form includes four real $4 \times 4$ matrices $α^{b}$. In presence of media matrix form requires two sets of $4 \times 4$ matrices, $α^{b}$ and $β^{b}$ -- simple and symmetrical realization of which is given. Relation of $α^{b}$ and $β^{b}$ to the Dirac matrices in spinor basis is found. Minkowski constitutive relations in case of any linear media are given in a short algebraic form based on the use of complex 3-vector fields and complex orthogonal rotations from SO(3.C) group. The matrix complex formulation in the Esposito's form,based on the use of two electromagnetic 4-vectors, $e^α(x) = u_β F^{αβ}(x), b^α (x) = u_β \tilde{F}^{αβ}(x) $ is studied and discussed. It is argued that Esposito form is achieved trough the use of a trivial identity $I=U^{-1}(u)U(u)$ in the Maxwell equation. 
0808.00605	The Density Probability Distribution in Compressible Isothermal Turbulence: Solenoidal versus Compressive Forcing	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Christoph Federrath, Ralf S. Klessen, Wolfram Schmidt	Abstract:  The probability density function (PDF) of the gas density in turbulent supersonic flows is investigated with high-resolution numerical simulations. In a systematic study, we compare the density statistics of compressible turbulence driven by the usually adopted solenoidal forcing (divergence-free) and by compressive forcing (curl-free). Our results are in agreement with studies using solenoidal forcing. However, compressive forcing yields a significantly broader density distribution with standard deviation ~3 times larger at the same rms Mach number. The standard deviation-Mach number relation used in analytical models of star formation is reviewed and a modification of the existing expression is proposed, which takes into account the ratio of solenoidal and compressive modes of the turbulence forcing. 
0808.00606	Proton channeling through long chiral carbon nanotubes: the rainbow route to equilibration	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:S. Petrovic, I. Telecki, D. Borka, N. Neskovic	Abstract:  In this work we investigate the rainbows appearing in channeling of 1 GeV protons through the long (11, 9) single-wall carbon nanotubes. The nanotube length is varied from 10 to 500 micrometers. The angular distributions of channeled protons are computed using the numerical solution of the proton equations of motion in the transverse plane and the Monte Carlo method. Each rainbow is characterized by a sharp decrease of the proton yield on its large angle side. As the nanotube length increases, the number of rainbows increases and the average distance between them decreases in an easily predictable way. When the average distance between the rainbows becomes smaller than the resolution of the angular distribution, one cannot distinguish between the adjacent rainbows, and the angular distribution becomes equilibrated. We call this route to equilibration the rainbow route to equilibration. This work is a demonstration of how a simple one-dimensional bound dynamic system can exhibit a complex collective behavior. 
0808.00607	A note on the Capelli identities for symmetric pairs of Hermitian type	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Kyo Nishiyama, Akihito Wachi	Abstract:  We get several identities of differential operators in determinantal form. These identities are non-commutative versions of the formula of Cauchy-Binet or Laplace expansions of determinants, and if we take principal symbols, they are reduced to such classical formulas. These identities are naturally arising from the generators of the rings of invariant differential operators over symmetric spaces, and have strong resemblance to the classical Capelli identities. Thus we call those identities the Capelli identities for symmetric pairs.

Stacy	Abstract:  The first stars were key drivers of early cosmic evolution. We review the main physical elements of the current consensus view, positing that the first stars were predominantly very massive. We continue with a discussion of important open questions that confront the standard model. Among them are uncertainties in the atomic and molecular physics of the hydrogen and helium gas, the multiplicity of stars that form in minihalos, and the possible existence of two separate modes of metal-free star formation. 
0808.00609	Shock Waves in Eulerian Cosmological Simulations: Main Properties and Acceleration of Cosmic Rays	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:F.Vazza, G.Brunetti, C.Gheller	Abstract:  We analyze the properties of Large Scale Shocks in a cosmological volume of size 103Mpc/h simulated with the public 1.0.1 release of the ENZO code. Different methods to identify and characterize shocks in post processing are discussed together with their uncertainties. Re-ionization affects the properties of shocks in simulations, and we propose a fitting procedure to model accurately the effect of re-ionization in non--radiative simulations, with a post--processing procedure. We investigate the properties of shocks by means of a procedure which uses jumps in the velocity variables across the cells in the simulations and this allows us to have a viable description of shocks also in relatively under-dense cosmic regions. We derive the distributions of the number of shocks and of the energy dissipated at these shocks as a function of their Mach number, and discuss the evolution of these distributions with cosmological time and across different cosmic environments (clusters, outskirts, filaments, voids). In line with some previous numerical studies (e.g. Ryu et al.2003, Pfrommer et al.2006) relatively weak shocks are found to dominate the process of energy dissipation in the simulated cosmic volume, although we find a larger ratio between weak and strong shocks with respect to previous studies. We estimate the rate of injection of CR at Large Scale Shocks by adopting injection efficiencies taken from previous numerical calculations. The flux dissipated in the form of CR within the whole simulated volume at the present epoch is about 20 per cent of the thermal energy dissipated at shocks; this fraction is smaller within galaxy clusters. 
0808.00610	Paradoxical Reflection in Quantum Mechanics	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Pedro L. Garrido, Sheldon Goldstein, Jani Lukkarinen, Roderich Tumulka	Abstract:  This article concerns a phenomenon of elementary quantum mechanics that is quite counter-intuitive, very non-classical, and apparently not widely known: a quantum particle can get reflected at a downward potential step. In contrast, classical particles get reflected only at upward steps. The conditions for this effect are that the wave length is much greater than the width of the potential step and the kinetic energy of the particle is much smaller than the depth of the potential step. This phenomenon is suggested by non-normalizable solutions to the time-independent Schroedinger equation, and we present evidence, numerical and mathematical, that it is also indeed predicted by the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. Furthermore, this paradoxical reflection effect suggests, and we confirm mathematically, that a quantum particle can be trapped for a long time (though not forever) in a region surrounded by downward potential steps, that is, on a plateau. 
0808.00611	Particle production in p-p collisions and prediction for LHC energy	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:I. Kraus, J. Cleymans, H. Oeschler, K. Redlich	Abstract:  We analyze recent data on particle production yields obtained in p-p collisions at SPS and RHIC energies within the statistical model. We apply the model formulated in the canonical ensemble and focus on strange particle production. We introduce different methods to account for strangeness suppression effects and discuss their phenomenological verification. We show that at RHIC the midrapidity data on strange and multistrange particle multiplicity can be successfully described by the canonical statistical model with and without an extra suppression effects. On the other hand, SPS data integrated over the full phase-space require an additional strangeness suppression factor that is beyond the conventional canonical model. This factor is quantified by the strangeness saturation parameter or strangeness correlation volume. Extrapolating all relevant thermal parameters from SPS and RHIC to LHC energy we present predictions of the statistical model for particle yields in p-p collisions at sqrt(s) = 14TeV. We discuss the role and the influence of a strangeness correlation volume on particle production in p-p collisions at LHC. 
0808.00612	Matter sound waves in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:B. B. Baizakov, A. M. Kamchatnov, M. Salerno	Abstract:  The creation and propagation of sound waves in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) are investigated and a new method of wave generation in binary BEC mixtures is proposed. The method is based on a fast change of the inter-species interaction constant and is illustrated for two experimental settings: a drop-like condensate immersed into a second large repulsive condensate, and a binary mixture of two homogeneous repulsive BEC's. A mathematical model based on the linearized coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations is developed and explicit formulae for the space and time dependence of sound waves are provided. Comparison of the analytical and numerical results shows excellent agreement, confirming the validity of the proposed approach. 
0808.00613	Proofs On Arnold Conjectures	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Renyi Ma	Abstract:  In this article, we give proofs on the Arnold Lagrangian intersection conjecture on the cotangent bundles, Arnold-Givental Lagrangian intersection conjecture and the Arnold fixed point conjecture. 
0808.00614	Fermionic vacuum densities in higher-dimensional de Sitter spacetime	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:E. R. Bezerra de Mello, A. A. Saharian	Abstract:  Fermionic condensate and the vacuum expectation values of the energy-momentum tensor are investigated for twisted and untwisted massive spinor fields in higher-dimensional de Sitter spacetime with toroidally compactified spatial dimensions. The expectation values are presented in the form of the sum of corresponding quantities in the uncompactified de Sitter spacetime and the parts induced by non-trivial topology. The latter are finite and the renormalization is needed for the first parts only. Closed formulae are derived for the renormalized fermionic vacuum densities in uncompactified odd-dimensional de Sitter spacetimes. It is shown that, unlike to the case of 4-dimensional spacetime, for large values of the mass, these densities are suppressed exponentially. Asymptotic behavior of the topological parts in the expectation values is investigated in the early and late stages of the cosmological expansion. When the comoving lengths of compactified dimensions are much smaller than the de Sitter curvature radius, to the leading order the topological parts coincide with the corresponding quantities for a massless fermionic field and are conformally related to the corresponding flat spacetime results. In this limit the topological parts dominate the uncompactified de Sitter part and the back-reaction effects should be taken into account. In the opposite limit, for a massive field the asymptotic behavior of the topological parts is damping oscillatory. 
0808.00615	The Weibull - log Weibull Transition of the Inter-occurrence time statistics in the two-dimensional Burridge-Knopoff Earthquake model	Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)	Authors:Tomohiro Hasumi, Takuma Akimoto, Yoji Aizawa	Abstract:  In analyzing synthetic earthquake catalogs created by a two-dimensional Burridge-Knopoff model, we have found that a probability distribution of the interoccurrence times, the time intervals between successive events, can be described clearly by the superposition of the Weibull distribution and the log-Weibull distribution. In addition, the interoccurrence time statistics depend on frictional properties and stiffness of a fault and exhibit the Weibull - log Weibull transition, which states that the distribution function changes from the log-Weibull regime to the Weibull regime when the threshold of magnitude is increased. We reinforce a new insight into this model; the model can be recognized as a mechanical model providing a framework of the Weibull - log Weibull transition. 
0808.00616	Dimensional crossover in quantum critical metallic magnets	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Markus Garst, Lars Fritz, Achim Rosch, Matthias Vojta	Abstract:  Nearly magnetic metals often have layered lattice structures, consisting of coupled planes. In such a situation, physical properties will display, upon decreasing temperature or energy, a dimensional crossover from two-dimensional (2d) to three-dimensional (3d) behavior, which is particularly interesting near quantum criticality. Here we study this crossover in thermodynamics using a suitably generalized Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson approach to the critical behavior, combined with renormalization group techniques. We focus on two experimentally relevant cases: the crossover from a 2d to a 3d antiferromagnet, and the crossover from a 2d ferromagnet to a 3d antiferromagnet. We discuss the location of phase boundary and crossover lines and determine the crossover functions for important thermodynamic quantities. As naive scaling does not apply at and above the upper critical dimension, two crossover scales arise which can be associated with separate dimensional crossovers of classical and quantum fluctuations, respectively. In particular, we find an intermediate regime with novel power laws where the quantum fluctuations still have a 2d and the classical fluctuations already have a 3d character. For the ferromagnet-to-antiferromagnet crossover, the mismatch of the dynamical exponents between the 2d and 3d regimes leads to an even richer crossover structure, with an interesting 2d non-critical regime sandwiched between two critical regimes. For all cases, we find that thermal expansion and compressibility are particularly sensitive probes of the dimensional crossover. Finally, we relate our results to experiments on the quantum critical heavy-fermion metals CeCu(6-x)Au(x), YbRh(2)Si(2) and CeCoIn(5). 
0808.00617	T Tauri Jet Physics Resolved Near The Launching Region with the Hubble Space Telescope	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Deirdre Coffey, Francesca Bacciotti, Linda Podio	Abstract:  We present an analysis of the gas physics at the base of jets from five T Tauri stars based on high angular resolution optical spectra, using the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS). The spectra refer to a region within 100 AU of the star, i.e. where the collimation of the jet has just taken place. We form PV images of the line ratios to get a global picture of the flow excitation. We then apply a specialised diagnostic technique to find the electron density, ionisation fraction, electron temperature and total density. Our results are in the form of PV maps of the obtained quantities, in which the gas behaviour is resolved as a function of both radial velocity and distance from the jet axis. They highlight a number of interesting physical features of the jet collimation region, including regions of extremely high density, asymmetries with respect to the axis, and possible shock signatures. Finally, we estimate the jet mass and angular momentum outflow rates, both of which are fundamental parameters in constraining models of accretion/ejection structures, particularily if the parameters can be determined close to the jet footpoint. Comparing mass flow rates for cases where the latter is available in the literature (i.e. DG Tau, RW Aur and CW Tau) reveals a mass ejection-to-accretion ratio of 0.01 - 0.07. Finally, where possible (i.e. DG Tau and CW Tau), both mass and angular momentum outflow rates have been resolved into higher and lower velocity jet material. For the clearer case of DG Tau, this revealed that the more collimated higher velocity component plays a dominant role in mass and angular momentum transport. 
0808.00618	A Simple Determination of the Thermodynamical Characteristics of a Very Thin Black Ring	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Vladan Pankovic, Simo Ciganovic	Abstract:  In this work we suggest a very simple, approximate formalism for description of some basic (especially thermodynamical) characteristics of a rotating, very thin black ring. (In fact, our formalism is not theoretically dubious, since, at it is not hard to see, it can correspond to an extreme simplification of a more accurate, Copeland-Lahiri string formalism for the black hole description.) Even if suggested formalism is, generally speaking, phenomenological and rough, obtained final results, unexpectedly, are non-trivial. Concretely, given formalism reproduces exactly Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, Bekenstein quantization of the entropy or horizon area and Hawking temperature of a rotating, very thin black ring obtained earlier using more accurate analysis by Reall, Emparan, Elvang, Virmani etc. (Conceptually it is similar to situation in Bohr's atomic model where energy levels are determined practically exactly even if electron motion is described roughly.) Our formalism, according to suggestions in our previous works, is physically based on the assumption that circumference of the horizon tube holds the natural (integer) number of corresponding reduced Compton's wave length. (It is conceptually similar to Bohr's quantization postulate in Bohr's atomic model interpreted by de Broglie relation.) Also, we use, mathematically, practically only simple algebraic equations (by determination of Hawking temperature we use additionally only simple differentiation of Smarr relation). 
0808.00619	Probing dust grain evolution in IM Lupi's circumstellar disc. Multi-wavelength observations and modelling of the dust disc	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:C. Pinte, D.L. Padgett, F. Menard, K.R. Stapelfeldt, G. Schneider, J. Olofsson, O. Panic, J.C. Augereau, G. Duchene, J. Krist, K. Pontoppidan, M.D. Perrin, C.A. Grady, J. Kessler-Silacci, E.F. van Dishoeck, D. Lommen, M. Silverstone, D.C. Hines, S. Wolf, G.A. Blake, T. Henning, B. Stecklum	Abstract:  We present a panchromatic study, involving a multiple technique approach, of the circumstellar disc surrounding the T Tauri star IM Lupi (Sz 82). We have undertaken a comprehensive observational study of IM Lupi using photometry, spectroscopy, millimetre interferometry and multi-wavelength imaging. For the first time, the disc is resolved from optical and near-infrared wavelengths in scattered light, to the millimetre regime in thermal emission. Our data-set, in conjunction with existing photometric data, provides an extensive coverage of the spectral energy distribution, including a detailed spectrum of the silicate emission bands. We have performed a simultaneous modelling of the various observations, using the radiative transfer code MCFOST, and analysed a grid of models over a large fraction of the parameter space via Bayesian inference. We have constructed a model that can reproduce all of the observations of the disc. Our analysis illustrates the importance of combining a wide range of observations in order to fully constrain the disc model, with each observation providing a strong constraint only on some aspects of the disc structure and dust content. Quantitative evidence of dust evolution in the disc is obtained: grain growth up to millimetre-sized particles, vertical stratification of dust grains with micrometric grains close to the disc surface and larger grains which have settled towards the disc midplane, and possibly the formation of fluffy aggregates and/or ice mantles around grains. 
0808.00620	The 2005 Neyman Lecture: Dynamic Indeterminism in Science	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:David R. Brillinger	Abstract:  Jerzy Neyman's life history and some of his contributions to applied statistics are reviewed. In a 1960 article he wrote: ``Currently in the period of dynamic indeterminism in science, there is hardly a serious piece of research which, if treated realistically, does not involve operations on stochastic processes. The time has arrived for the theory of stochastic processes to become an item of usual equipment of every applied statistician.'' The emphasis in this article is on stochastic processes and on stochastic process data analysis. A number of data sets and corresponding substantive questions are addressed. The data sets concern sardine depletion, blowfly dynamics, weather modification, elk movement and seal journeying. Three of the examples are from Neyman's work and four from the author's joint work with collaborators. 
0808.00621	Atomic Hole Doping of Graphene	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Isabella Gierz, Christian Riedl, Ulrich Starke, Christian R. Ast, Klaus Kern	Abstract:  Graphene is an excellent candidate for the next generation of electronic materials due to the strict two-dimensionality of its electronic structure as well as the extremely high carrier mobility. A prerequisite for the development of graphene based electronics is the reliable control of the type and density of the charge carriers by external (gate) and internal (doping) means. While gating has been successfully demonstrated for graphene flakes and epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide, the development of reliable chemical doping methods turns out to be a real challenge. In particular hole doping is an unsolved issue. So far it has only been achieved with reactive molecular adsorbates, which are largely incompatible with any device technology. Here we show by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy that atomic doping of an epitaxial graphene layer on a silicon carbide substrate with bismuth, antimony or gold presents effective means of p-type doping. Not only is the atomic doping the method of choice for the internal control of the carrier density. In combination with the intrinsic n-type character of epitaxial graphene on SiC, the charge carriers can be tuned from electrons to holes, without affecting the conical band structure. 
0808.00622	On the Shortest Identity in Finite Simple Groups of Lie Type	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Uzy Hadad	Abstract:  We prove that the length of the shortest identity in a finite simple group of Lie type of rank $r$ defined over $\mathbb{F}_q$, is bounded (from above and below) by explicit polynomials in $q$ and $r$. 
0808.00623	Avalanche prediction in Self-organized systems	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:O. Ramos, E. Altshuler, K. J. Maloy	Abstract:  It is a common belief that power-law distributed avalanches are inherently unpredictable. This idea affects phenomena as diverse as evolution, earthquakes, superconducting vortices, stock markets, etc; from atomic to social scales. It mainly comes from the concept of ``Self-organized criticality" (SOC), where criticality is interpreted in the way that at any moment, any small avalanche can eventually cascade into a large event. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates experimentally the possibility of avalanche prediction in the classical paradigm of SOC: a sandpile. By knowing the position of every grain in a two-dimensional pile, avalanches of moving grains follow a distinct power-law distribution. Large avalanches, although uncorrelated, are preceded by continuous, detectable variations in the internal structure of the pile that are monitored in order to achieve prediction. 
0808.00624	The influence of reconstruction criteria on the sensitive probes of the symmetry potential	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Qingfeng Li	Abstract:  Different criteria of constructing clusters and tracing back $Δ$ resonances from the intermediate-energy neutron-rich HICs are discussed by employing the updated UrQMD transport model. It is found that both the phase-space and the coordinate-density criteria affect the single and the double neutron/proton ratios of free nucleons at small transverse momenta, but the influence becomes invisible at large transverse momenta. The effect of different methods of reconstructing freeze-out $Δ$s on the $Δ^0/Δ^{++}$ ratio is strong in a large kinetic energy region. 
0808.00625	The third homology of the special linear group of a field	K-Theory and Homology (math.KT)	Authors:Kevin Hutchinson, Liqun Tao	Abstract:  We prove that for any infinite field homology stability for the third integral homology of the special linear groups $SL(n,F)$ begins at $n=3$. When $n=2$ the cokernel of the map from the third homology of $SL(2,F)$ to the third homology of $SL(3,F)$ is naturally isomorphic to the square of Milnor $K_3$. We discuss applications to the indecomposable $K_3$ of the field and to Milnor-Witt K-theory. 
0808.00626	Factorization at fixed Q^2(1-x)	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Paul Hoyer, Matti Jarvinen, Samu Kurki	Abstract:  We consider QCD factorization between hard and soft subprocesses in inclusive reactions where the momentum fraction x of one parton approaches unity as the hard scale Q^2 -> \infty, such that Q^2(1-x) is fixed. In this "BB limit" the entire (multi-parton) Fock state containing the high x parton is coherent with the hard subprocess. The soft contribution is given by a forward multiparton matrix element. The BB limit corresponds to a fixed (large or small) missing mass and is thus closely connected to exclusive production. We analyze the Drell-Yan process h + N -> γ^* + X in detail, explaining why the virtual photon is longitudinally polarized for h = πand transversely polarized for h = p. The BB limit may be relevant also for other phenomena observed at high x, such as the large single spin asymmetries of p p -> Λ^\uparrow X and in p p^\uparrow -> πX. 
0808.00627	Condensate induced transitions between topologically ordered phases	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:F.A. Bais, J.K. Slingerland	Abstract:  We investigate transitions between topologically ordered phases in two spatial dimensions induced by the condensation of a bosonic quasiparticle. To this end, we formulate an extension of the theory of symmetry breaking phase transitions which applies to phases with topological excitations described by quantum groups or modular tensor categories. This enables us to deal with phases whose quasiparticles have non-integer quantum dimensions and obey braid statistics. Many examples of such phases can be constructed from two-dimensional rational conformal field theories and we find that there is a beautiful connection between quantum group symmetry breaking and certain well-known constructions in conformal field theory, notably the coset construction, the construction of orbifold models and more general conformal extensions. Besides the general framework, many representative examples are worked out in detail. 
0808.00628	P-wave Lambda N - Sigma N coupling and the spin-orbit splitting of 9 Lambda Be	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Y. Fujiwara (1), M. Kohno (2), Y. Suzuki (3) ((1) Kyoto, (2) Kyushu Dental, (3) Niigata)    	Abstract:  We reexamine the spin-orbit splitting of 9 Lambda Be excited states in terms of the SU_6 quark-model baryon-baryon interaction. The previous folding procedure to generate the Lambda alpha spin-orbit potential from the quark-model Lambda N LS interaction kernel predicted three to five times larger values for Delta E_{ell s}=E_x(3/2^+)-E_x(5/2^+) in the model FSS and fss2. This time, we calculate Lambda alpha LS Born kernel, starting from the LS components of the nuclear-matter G-matrix for the Lambda hyperon. This framework makes it possible to take full account of an important P-wave Lambda N - Sigma N coupling through the antisymmetric LS^{(-)} force involved in the Fermi-Breit interaction. We find that the experimental value, Delta E^{exp}_{ell s}=43 pm 5 keV, is reproduced by the quark-model G-matrix LS interaction with a Fermi-momentum around k_F=1.0 fm^{-1}, when the model FSS is used in the energy-independent renormalized RGM formalism. 
0808.00629	Dirac-Kähler field, spinor technique, and 2-potential approach to electrodynamics with two charges	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:V.M. Red'kov	Abstract:  From the 16-component Dirac-Kähler field theory, spinor equations for two types of massless vector photon fields with different parities have been derived. Their equivalent tensor equations in terms of the strength tensor $F_{ab}$ and respective 4-vector $A_{b}$ and 4-pseudovector $\tilde{A}_{b}$ depending on intrinsic photon parity are derived; they include additional sources, electric 4-vector $j_{b}$ and magnetic 4-pseudovector $\tilde{j}_{b}$. The theories of two types of photon fields are explicitly uncoupled, their linear combination through summing or subtracting results in Maxwell electrodynamics with electric and magnetic charges in 2-potential approach. So the problem of existence of magnetic charge can be understood as a super selection rule for different photon fields in intrinsic parity. The whole analysis is extended straightforwardly to a curved space-time background. In the frames of that extended Maxwell theory, the known electromagnetic duality is described as a linear transformation mixing the field variables referred to photons with different parities. That extended dual transformation concerns both strength tensors and 4-potentials $A_{b}, \tilde{A}_{b}$. 
0808.00630	Exact phase diagram of quasispecies model with mutation rate modifier	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:Apoorva Nagar, Kavita Jain	Abstract:  We consider an infinite asexual population with a mutator allele which can elevate mutation rates. With probability $f$, a transition from nonmutator to mutator state occurs but the reverse transition is forbidden. We find that at $f=0$, the population is in the state with minimum mutation rate and at $f=f_c$, a phase transition occurs between a mixed phase with both nonmutators and mutators and a pure mutator phase. We calculate the critical probability $f_c$ and the total mutator fraction $Q$ in the mixed phase exactly. Our predictions for $Q$ are in agreement with those seen in microbial populations in static environments.

0808.00632	Photoproduction of eta meson within a coupled-channels K-matrix approach	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:R. Shyam, O. Scholten	Abstract:  We investigate photoproduction of eta mesons off protons and neutrons within a coupled-channels effective-Lagrangian method which is based on the K-matrix approach. The two-body final channels included are pi-N, eta-N, phi-N, rho-N, gamma-N, K-Lambda, and K-Sigma. Non-resonant meson-baryon interactions are included in the model via nucleon intermediate states in the s- and u-channels, meson exchanges in the t-channel amplitude and the u-channel resonances. The nucleon resonances S_{11}(1535), S_{11}(1650), S_{31}(1620), P_{11}(1440), P_{11}(1710), P_{13}(1720), P_{33}(1232), P_{33}(1600), D_{13}(1520), D_{13}(1700), and D_{33}(1700) are included explicitly in calculations. Our model describes simultaneously the available data as well on total and differential cross sections as on beam and target asymmetries. This holds for the p(gamma,eta)p reaction for photon energies ranging from very close to threshold to up to 3 GeV. The polarization observables show strong sensitivity to resonances that otherwise contribute only weakly to the total cross section. It is found that the pronounced bump-like structure seen in the excitation function of the n(gamma,eta)n cross section at gamma energies around 1 GeV, can be explained by the interference effects of S_{11}, P_{11} and P_{13} resonance contributions. 
0808.00633	Maximum entangled states and quantum Teleportation via Single Cooper pair Box	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:N. Metwally, A. A. El-Amin	Abstract:  In this contribution, we study a single Cooper pair box interacts with a single cavity mode. We show the roles played by the detuning parameters and charged capacities on the degree of entanglement. For large values of the detuning parameter the survival entanglement increases on the expanse of the degree of entanglement. We generate a maximum entangled state and use it to perform the original teleportation protocol. The fidelity of the teleportated state is increased with decreasing the detuning parameter and the number of photon inside the cavity. 
0808.00634	Reducing Protocol Analysis with XOR to the XOR-free Case in the Horn Theory Based Approach	Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)	Authors:Ralf Kuesters, Tomasz Truderung	Abstract:  In the Horn theory based approach for cryptographic protocol analysis, cryptographic protocols and (Dolev-Yao) intruders are modeled by Horn theories and security analysis boils down to solving the derivation problem for Horn theories. This approach and the tools based on this approach, including ProVerif, have been very successful in the automatic analysis of cryptographic protocols w.r.t. an unbounded number of sessions. However, dealing with the algebraic properties of operators such as the exclusive OR (XOR) has been problematic. In particular, ProVerif cannot deal with XOR. In this paper, we show how to reduce the derivation problem for Horn theories with XOR to the XOR-free case. Our reduction works for an expressive class of Horn theories. A large class of intruder capabilities and protocols that employ the XOR operator can be modeled by these theories. Our reduction allows us to carry out protocol analysis by tools, such as ProVerif, that cannot deal with XOR, but are very efficient in the XOR-free case. We implemented our reduction and, in combination with ProVerif, applied it in the automatic analysis of several protocols that use the XOR operator. In one case, we found a new attack. 
0808.00635	Symplectic invariants, Virasoro constraints and Givental decomposition	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:N. Orantin	Abstract:  Following the works of Alexandrov, Mironov and Morozov, we show that the symplectic invariants of \cite{EOinvariants} built from a given spectral curve satisfy a set of Virasoro constraints associated to each pole of the differential form $ydx$ and each zero of $dx$ . We then show that they satisfy the same constraints as the partition function of the Matrix M-theory defined by Alexandrov, Mironov and Morozov. The duality between the different matrix models of this theory is made clear as a special case of dualities between symplectic invariants. Indeed, a symplectic invariant admits two decomposition: as a product of Kontsevich integrals on the one hand, and as a product of 1 hermitian matrix integral on the other hand. These two decompositions can be though of as Givental formulae for the KP tau functions. 
0808.00636	A method to create disordered vortex arrays in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Eniko J. M. Madarassy	Abstract:  We suggest a method to create turbulence in a trapped atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). By replacing in the upper half part of our box the wave function, Psi, with its complex conjugate, Psi^{*}, new negative vortices are introduced into the system. The simulations are performed by solving the two-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation (2D GPE). We study the successive dynamics of the wave function by monitoring the evolution of density and phase profile. 
0808.00637	On the origin of radio emission in radio quiet quasars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ari Laor, Ehud Behar	Abstract:  The radio emission in radio loud quasars originates in a jet carrying relativistic electrons. In radio quiet quasars (RQQs) the relative radio emission is ~10^3 times weaker, and its origin is not established yet. We show here that there is a strong correlation between the radio luminosity (L_R) and X-ray luminosity (L_X) with L_R~10^-5L_X, for the radio quiet Palomar-Green (PG) quasar sample. The sample is optically selected, with nearly complete radio and X-ray detections, and thus this correlation cannot be due to direct selection biases. The PG quasars lie on an extension of a similar correlation noted by Panessa et al., for a small sample of nearby low luminosity type 1 AGN. A remarkably similar correlation, known as the Guedel-Benz relation, where L_R/L_X~10^-5, holds for coronally active stars. The Guedel-Benz relation, together with correlated stellar X-ray and radio variability, implies that the coronae are magnetically heated. We therefore raise the possibility that AGN coronae are also magnetically heated, and that the radio emission in RQQ also originates in coronal activity. If correct, then RQQ should generally display compact flat cores at a few GHz due to synchrotron self-absorption, while at a few hundred GHz we should be able to see directly the X-ray emitting corona, and relatively rapid and large amplitude variability, correlated with the X-ray variability, is likely to be seen. We also discuss possible evidence that the radio and X-ray emission in ultra luminous X-ray sources and Galactic black holes may be of coronal origin as well.

Next we concentrate on the Riesz and B{á}ez-Duarte criteria. We proof that they are equivalent and we provide some computer data to support them.

0808.00641	Distance to VY Canis Majoris with VERA	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yoon Kyung Choi, Tomoya Hirota, Mareki Honma, Hideyuki Kobayashi, Takeshi Bushimata, Hiroshi Imai, Kenzaburo Iwadate, Takaaki Jike, Seiji Kameno, Osamu Kameya, Ryuichi Kamohara, Yukitoshi Kan-ya, Noriyuki Kawaguchi, Masachika Kijima, Mi Kyoung Kim, Seisuke Kuji, Tomoharu Kurayama, Seiji Manabe, Kenta Maruyama, Makoto Matsui, Naoko Matsumoto, Takeshi Miyaji, Takumi Nagayama, Akiharu Nakagawa, Kayoko Nakamura, Chung Sik Oh, Toshihiro Omodaka, Tomoaki Oyama, Satoshi Sakai, Tetsuo Sasao, Katsuhisa Sato, Mayumi Sato, Katsunori M. Shibata, Yoshiaki Tamura, Miyuki Thushima, Kazuyoshi Yamashita	Abstract:  We report astrometric observations of H2O masers around the red supergiant VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) carried out with VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA). Based on astrometric monitoring for 13 months, we successfully measured a trigonometric parallax of 0.88 +/- 0.08 mas, corresponding to a distance of 1.14 +0.11/-0.09 kpc. This is the most accurate distance to VY CMa and the first one based on an annual parallax measurement. The luminosity of VY CMa has been overestimated due to a previously accepted distance. With our result, we re-estimate the luminosity of VY CMa to be (3 +/- 0.5) x 10^5 L_sun using the bolometric flux integrated over optical and IR wavelengths. This improved luminosity value makes location of VY CMa on the Hertzsprung-Russel (HR) diagram much closer to the theoretically allowable zone (i.e. the left side of the Hayashi track) than previous ones, though uncertainty in the effective temperature of the stellar surface still does not permit us to make a final conclusion. 
0808.00642	How to use retarded Green's functions in de Sitter spacetime	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Atsushi Higuchi, Yen Cheong Lee	Abstract:  We demonstrate in examples that the covariant retarded Green's functions in electromagnetism and linearized gravity work as expected in de Sitter spacetime. We first clarify how retarded Green's functions should be used in spacetimes with spacelike past infinity such as de Sitter spacetime. In particular, we remind the reader of a general formula which gives the field for given initial data on a Cauchy surface and a given source (a charge or stress-energy tensor distribution) in its future. We then apply this formula to three examples: (i) electromagnetism in the future of a Cauchy surface in Minkowski spacetime, (ii) electromagnetism in de Sitter spacetime, and (iii) linearized gravity in de Sitter spacetime. In each example the field is reproduced correctly as predicted by the general argument. In the third example we construct a linearized gravitational field from two equal point masses located at the "North and South Poles" which is non-singular on the cosmological horizon and satisfies a covariant gauge condition and show that this field is reproduced by the retarded Green's function with corresponding gauge parameters. 
0808.00643	Molecules in Coorbit Spaces and Boundedness of Operators	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Karlheinz Gröchenig Mariusz Piotrowski	Abstract:  We study the notion of molecules in coorbit spaces. The main result states that if an operator, originally defined on an appropriate space of test functions, maps atoms to molecules, then it can be extended to a bounded operator on coorbit spaces. For time-frequency molecules we recover some boundedness results on modulation spaces, for time-scale molecules we obtain the boundedness on homogenous Besov spaces. 
0808.00644	Modeling vacancies and hydrogen impurities in graphene: A molecular point of view	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:G. Forte, A. Grassi, G. M. Lombardo, A. La Magna, G. G. N. Angilella, R. Pucci, R. Vilardi	Abstract:  We have followed a "molecular" approach to study impurity effects in graphene. This is thought as the limiting case of an infinitely large cluster of benzene rings. Therefore, we study several carbon clusters, with increasing size, from phenalene, including three benzene rings, up to coronene 61, with 61 benzene rings. The impurities considered were a chemisorbed H atom, a vacancy, and a substitutional proton. We performed HF and UHF calculations using the STO-3G basis set. With increasing cluster size in the absence of impurities, we find a decreasing energy gap, here defined as the HOMO-LUMO difference. In the case of H chemisorption or a vacancy, the gap does not decrease appreciably, whereas it is substantially reduced in the case of a substitutional proton. The presence of an impurity invariably induces an increase of the density of states near the HOMO level. We find a zero mode only in the case of a substitutional proton. In agreement with experiments, we find that both the chemisorbed H, the substitutional proton, and the C atom near a vacancy acquire a magnetic moment. The relevance of graphene clusters for the design of novel electronic devices is also discussed. 
0808.00645	Verbal Autopsy Methods with Multiple Causes of Death	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:Gary King, Ying Lu	Abstract:  Verbal autopsy procedures are widely used for estimating cause-specific mortality in areas without medical death certification. Data on symptoms reported by caregivers along with the cause of death are collected from a medical facility, and the cause-of-death distribution is estimated in the population where only symptom data are available. Current approaches analyze only one cause at a time, involve assumptions judged difficult or impossible to satisfy, and require expensive, time-consuming, or unreliable physician reviews, expert algorithms, or parametric statistical models. By generalizing current approaches to analyze multiple causes, we show how most of the difficult assumptions underlying existing methods can be dropped. These generalizations also make physician review, expert algorithms and parametric statistical assumptions unnecessary. With theoretical results, and empirical analyses in data from China and Tanzania, we illustrate the accuracy of this approach. While no method of analyzing verbal autopsy data, including the more computationally intensive approach offered here, can give accurate estimates in all circumstances, the procedure offered is conceptually simpler, less expensive, more general, as or more replicable, and easier to use in practice than existing approaches. We also show how our focus on estimating aggregate proportions, which are the quantities of primary interest in verbal autopsy studies, may also greatly reduce the assumptions necessary for, and thus improve the performance of, many individual classifiers in this and other areas. As a companion to this paper, we also offer easy-to-use software that implements the methods discussed herein. 
0808.00646	Cooper problem in a lattice	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:J.-P. Martikainen	Abstract:  Cooper problem for interacting fermions is solved in a lattice. It is found that the binding energy of the Cooper problem can behave qualitatively differently from the gap parameter of the BCS theory and that pairs of non-zero center of mass momentum are favored in systems with unequal Fermi energies. 
0808.00647	Model Checking Positive Equality-free FO: Boolean Structures and Digraphs of Size Three	Computational Complexity (cs.CC)	Authors:Barnaby Martin	Abstract:  We study the model checking problem, for fixed structures A, over positive equality-free first-order logic -- a natural generalisation of the non-uniform quantified constraint satisfaction problem QCSP(A). We prove a complete complexity classification for this problem when A ranges over 1.) boolean structures and 2.) digraphs of size (less than or equal to) three. The former class displays dichotomy between Logspace and Pspace-complete, while the latter class displays tetrachotomy between Logspace, NP-complete, co-NP-complete and Pspace-complete.

We will investigate under what conditions delay cannot cause instability in higher dimension. We give an example when delay causes instability. 
0808.00649	Dark Energy and Electrons	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:Burra G.Sidharth	Abstract:  In the light of recent developments in Dark Energy, we consider the electron in a such a background field and show that at the Compton wavelength the electron is stable, in that the Cassini inward pressure exactly counterbalances the outward Coulomb repulsive pressure thus answering a problem of the earlier electron theory. 
0808.00650	Summary of the 3rd International Workshop on a Far Detector in Korea for the J-PARC Beam	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:T. Kajita, S.B. Kim, A.Rubbia	Abstract:  The 3rd International Workshop on a Far Detector in Korea for the J-PARC Neutrino Beam was held at the Hongo Campus of Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan on Sep. 30th and October 1, 2007. Forty seven physicists from Japan and Korea, as well as Europe and USA, participated in the workshop and discussed the physics opportunities offered by the J-PARC conventional neutrino beam detected by a new large underground neutrino detector in Korea. In this paper, we highlight some of the most relevant findings of the workshop. 
0808.00651	Bipartite Units of Non-Locality	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Manuel Forster, Stefan Wolf	Abstract:  Imagine a task in which a group of separated players aim to simulate a statistic that violates a Bell inequality. Given measurement choices the players shall announce an output based solely on the results of local operations -- which they can discuss before the separation -- on shared random data and shared copies of a so-called unit correlation. In the first part of this article we show that in such a setting the simulation of any bipartite correlation, not containing the possibility of signaling, can be made arbitrarily accurate by increasing the number of shared Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) boxes. This establishes the PR box as a simple asymptotic unit of bipartite nonlocality. In the second part we study whether this property extends to the multipartite case. More generally, we ask if it is possible for separated players to asymptotically reproduce any nonsignaling statistic by local operations on bipartite unit correlations. We find that non-adaptive strategies are limited by a constant accuracy and that arbitrary strategies on n resource correlations make a mistake with a probability greater or equal to c/n, for some constant c. 
0808.00652	Fresnel interferometric arrays for space-based imaging: testbed results	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Denis Serre, Laurent Koechlin, Paul Deba	Abstract:  This paper presents the results of a Fresnel Interferometric Array testbed. This new concept of imager involves diffraction focussing by a thin foil, in which many thousands of punched subapertures form a pattern related to a Fresnel zone plate. This kind of array is intended for use in space, as a way to realizing lightweight large apertures for high angular resolution and high dynamic range observations. The chromaticity due to diffraction focussing is corrected by a small diffractive achromatizer placed close to the focal plane of the array. The laboratory test results presented here are obtained with an 8 centimeter side orthogonal array, yielding a 23 meter focal length at 600 nm wavelength. The primary array and the focal optics have been designed and assembled in our lab. This system forms an achromatic image. Test targets of various shapes, sizes, dynamic ranges and intensities have been imaged. We present the first images, the achieved dynamic range, and the angular resolution. 
0808.00653	On the formal grade of finitely generated modules over local rings	Commutative Algebra (math.AC)	Authors:Mohsen Asgharzadeh, Kamran Divaani-Aazar	Abstract:  Let \fa be an ideal of a local ring (R,\fm) and M a finitely generated R-module. This paper concerns the notion \fgrade(\fa,M), the formal grade of M with respect to \fa (i.e. the least integer i such that {\vpl}_nH^i_{\fm}(M/\fa^n M)\neq 0). We show that \fgrade(\fa,M)\geq \depth M-\cd_{\fa}(M), and as a result, we establish a new characterization of Cohen-Macaulay modules. As an application of this characterization, we show that if M is Cohen-Macaulay and L a pure submodule of M with the same support as M, then \fgrade(\fa,L)=\fgrade(\fa,M). Also, we give a generalization of the Hochster-Eagon result on Cohen-Macaulayness of invariant rings. 
0808.00654	Top Quark Mass Measurements at the Tevatron	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Jahred Adelman, for the CDF, D0 Collaborations	Abstract:  Top quark mass measurements from the Tevatron using up to \invfb{2.0} of data are presented. Prospects for combined Tevatron measurements by the end of Run II are discussed. 
0808.00655	Turbulent AGN tori	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Schartmann (1,2,3), K. Meisenheimer (1), H. Klahr (1), M. Camenzind (4), S. Wolf (5), Th. Henning (1) ((1) MPIA, Heidelberg, Germany (2) MPE, Garching, Germany (3) USM, Munich, Germany (4) ZAH-LSW, Heidelberg, Germany (5) Christian-Albrechts-Universitaet, Kiel, Germany)    	Abstract:  Recently, the MID-infrared Interferometric instrument (MIDI) at the VLTI has shown that dust tori in the two nearby Seyfert galaxies NGC 1068 and the Circinus galaxy are geometrically thick and can be well described by a thin, warm central disk, surrounded by a colder and fluffy torus component. By carrying out hydrodynamical simulations with the help of the TRAMP code (Klahr et al. 1999), we follow the evolution of a young nuclear star cluster in terms of discrete mass-loss and energy injection from stellar processes. This naturally leads to a filamentary large scale torus component, where cold gas is able to flow radially inwards. The filaments open out into a dense and very turbulent disk structure. In a post-processing step, we calculate observable quantities like spectral energy distributions or images with the help of the 3D radiative transfer code MC3D (Wolf 2003). Good agreement is found in comparisons with data due to the existence of almost dust-free lines of sight through the large scale component and the large column densities caused by the dense disk. 
0808.00656	An estimate of the prehadron production time	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Alberto Accardi	Abstract:  A semi-quantitative estimate of the prehadron production time based on recent preliminary HERMES data on hadron transverse momentum broadening in nuclear DIS is presented. The obtained production time can well explain the data except for their dependence on the photon virtuality, which remains a challenge to current theoretical models. A few mechanisms that may contribute to its explanation are suggested, along with possible experimental tests. The average time scale at HERMES is found to be of the order of 4-5 fm, comparable to heavy nuclei radii, so that by suitable kinematic cuts it will be possible to study both the case in which hadronization starts inside and the case in which it starts outside the nucleus. A comparison with recent CLAS preliminary data, which qualitatively but not quantitatively agree with HERMES, is performed. 
0808.00657	High-Breakdown Robust Multivariate Methods	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:Mia Hubert, Peter J. Rousseeuw, Stefan Van Aelst	Abstract:  When applying a statistical method in practice it often occurs that some observations deviate from the usual assumptions. However, many classical methods are sensitive to outliers. The goal of robust statistics is to develop methods that are robust against the possibility that one or several unannounced outliers may occur anywhere in the data. These methods then allow to detect outlying observations by their residuals from a robust fit. We focus on high-breakdown methods, which can deal with a substantial fraction of outliers in the data. We give an overview of recent high-breakdown robust methods for multivariate settings such as covariance estimation, multiple and multivariate regression, discriminant analysis, principal components and multivariate calibration. 
0808.00658	Advances in the measurement of the Lense-Thirring effect with Satellite Laser Ranging in the gravitational field of the Earth	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Lorenzo Iorio	Abstract:  In this Chapter we deal with the attempts to measure the general relativistic gravitomagnetic Lense-Thirring effect with the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) technique applied to the existing LAGEOS and LAGEOS II terrestrial satellites and to the recently approved LARES. 
0808.00659	Enhancement of On-Site Interactions of Tunnelling Ultracold Atoms in Optical Potentials using Radio-Frequency Dressing	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Martin Shotter, Dimitrios Trypogeorgos, Christopher Foot	Abstract:  We show how it is possible to more than double the on-site interaction energy of neutral atoms in optical potentials by the technique of radio-frequency (rf) dressing, while maintaining interwell dynamics. We calculate Bose-Hubbard parameters for rf dressed optical lattices and arrays of rf dressed dipole traps. We show that decreasing the distance between wells, by the interpolation of wells confining different m_F states, increases the interaction energy more than decreasing the height of the classically forbidden region between existing wells. The schemes we propose have negligible Landau-Zener losses caused by atomic motion; this was a dominant effect in the first experimental demonstration of the modification of an optical potential by radio-frequency dressing. 
0808.00660	Thermal Conductivity for a Noisy Disordered Harmonic Chain	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Cedric Bernardin (UMPA-Ensl)    	Abstract:  We consider a $d$-dimensional disordered harmonic chain (DHC) perturbed by an energy conservative noise. We obtain uniform in the volume upper and lower bounds for the thermal conductivity defined through the Green-Kubo formula. These bounds indicate a positive finite conductivity. We prove also that the infinite volume homogenized Green-Kubo formula converges. 
0808.00661	Superdiffusivity of Asymmetric Energy Model in Dimension One and Two	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Cedric Bernardin (UMPA-Ensl)    	Abstract:  We discuss an asymmetric energy model (AEM) introduced by Giardina et al. in \cite{7}. This model is expected to belong to the KPZ class. We obtain lower bounds for the diffusion coefficient. In particular, the diffusion coefficient is diverging in dimension one and two as it is expected in the KPZ picture. 
0808.00662	Stationary non-equilibrium properties for a heat conduction model	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Cedric Bernardin (UMPA-Ensl)    	Abstract:  We consider a stochastic heat conduction model for solids composed by N interacting atoms. The system is in contact with two heat baths at different temperature $T_\ell$ and $T_r$. The bulk dynamics conserve two quantities: the energy and the deformation between atoms. If $T_\ell \neq T_r$, a heat flux takes place in the system. For large $N$, the system adopts a linear temperature profile between $T_\ell$ and $T_r$. We establish the hydrodynamic limit for the two conserved quantities. We introduce the fluctuations field of the energy and of the deformation in the non-equilibrium steady state. As $N$ goes to infinity, we show that this field converges to a Gaussian field and we compute the limiting covariance matrix. The main contribution of the paper is the study of large deviations for the temperature profile in the non-equilibrium stationary state. A variational formula for the rate function is derived following the recent macroscopic fluctuation theory of Bertini et al.

0808.00664	Comprehensive Analysis of Neutrinos in SK part I --Directions of the Incident Neutrinos and the Produced Leptons--	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:E. Konishi (1), Y. Minorikawa (2), V.I. Galkin (3), M. Ishiwata (4), I. Nakamura (4), N. Takahashi (1), M. Kato (5), A. Misaki (6) ((1)Hirosaki University, Hirosaki, Japan, (2) Kinki University, Japan, (3)Moscow State University, Russia, (4)Saitama University, Japan, (5) Kyowa Interface Science Co., Ltd., Japan, (6)Waseda University, Japan)    	Abstract:  Super-Kamiokande collaboration assumes that the direction of every observed lepton coincides with the incoming direction of the incident neutrino, which is the fundamental basement throughout all their analysis on neutrino oscillation. We examine whether this assumption to explain the experimental results on neutrino oscillation is theoretically acceptable. Treating every physical process concerned stochastically, we have examined if this assumption just cited is acceptable. As the result of it, we have shown that this assumption does not hold even if statistically. 
0808.00665	Weighted distance transforms generalized to modules and their computation on point lattices	Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)	Authors:Céline Fouard (INRIA Sophia Antipolis), Robin Strand (CBA), Gunilla Borgefors (CBA)    	Abstract:  This paper presents the generalization of weighted distances to modules and their computation through the chamfer algorithm on general point lattices. The first part is dedicated to formalization of definitions and properties (distance, metric, norm) of weighted distances on modules. It resumes tools found in literature to express the weighted distance of any point of a module and to compute optimal weights in the general case to get rotation invariant distances. The second part of this paper proves that, for any point lattice, the sequential two-scan chamfer algorithm produces correct distance maps. Finally, the definitions and computation of weighted distances are applied to the face-centered cubic (FCC) and body-centered cubic (BCC) grids. 
0808.00666	Density Matrix Renormalization Group in the Heisenberg Picture	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Michael J. Hartmann, Javier Prior, Stephen R. Clark, Martin B. Plenio	Abstract:  In some cases the state of a quantum system with a large number of subsystems can be approximated efficiently by the density matrix renormalization group, which makes use of redundancies in the description of the state. Here we show that the achievable efficiency can be much better when performing density matrix renormalization group calculations in the Heisenberg picture, as only the observable of interest but not the entire state is considered. In some non-trivial cases, this approach can even be exact for finite bond dimensions. 
0808.00667	Geometry of minimal energy Yang-Mills connections	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Mark A. Stern	Abstract:  We study the converse to the statement that instantons are minimizers of the Yang--Mills energy in four dimensions. We show that given an energy minimizing connection, A, the curvature of A takes values in a subbundle of the adjoint bundle which decomposes as a sum of instantons. 
0808.00668	Dynamics of non-harmonic internal gravity wave packets in stratified media	Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)	Authors:Vitaly V. Bulatov (1) ((1) Institute for Problems in Mechanics, Russian Academy of Sciences)    	Abstract:  In the paper taking the assumption of the slowness of the change of the parameters of the vertically stratified medium in the horizontal direction and in time, the evolution of the non-harmonic wave packages of the internal gravity waves has been analyzed. The concrete form of the wave packages can be expressed through some model functions and is defined by the local behavior of the dispersive curves of the separate modes near to the corresponding special points. The solution of this problem is possible with the help of the modified variant of the special-time ray method offered by the authors (the method of geometrical optics), the basic difference of which consists that the asymptotic representation of the solution may be found in the form the series of the non-integer degrees of some small parameter. At that the exponent depends on the concrete form of representation of this package. The obvious kind of the representation is determined from the principle of the localness and the asymptotic behavior of the solution in the stationary and the horizontally-homogeneous case. The phases of the wave packages are determined from the corresponding equations of the eikonal, which can be solved numerically on the characteristics (rays). Amplitudes of the wave packages are determined from the laws of conservation of the some invariants along the characteristics (rays). 
0808.00669	Spin Density Matrix Elements from diffractive $φ$ meson production at HERMES	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:HERMES Collaboration: W. Augustyniak, A. Borissov, S. Manayenkov	Abstract:  Exclusive production of $φ$ mesons on hydrogen and deuterium targets is studied in the HERMES kinematic region $1 < Q^{2} < 7$ GeV$^2$ and $3.0 < W < 6.3$ GeV. Spin density matrix elements and their $Q^{2}$ and $t$ dependences are presented. These data are consistent with s-channel helicity conservation in exclusive $φ$ meson production. No significant evidence for the contribution of unnatural-parity-exchange amplitudes is found. 
0808.00670	Low energy properties of the random displacement model	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Jeff Baker, Michael Loss, Günter Stolz	Abstract:  We study low-energy properties of the random displacement model, a random Schrödinger operator describing an electron in a randomly deformed lattice. All periodic displacement configurations which minimize the bottom of the spectrum are characterized. While this configuration is essentially unique for dimension greater than one, there are infinitely many different minimizing configurations in the one-dimensional case. The latter leads to unusual low energy asymptotics for the integrated density of states of the one-dimensional random displacement model. For symmetric Bernoulli-distributed displacements it has a $1/\log^2$-singularity at the bottom of the spectrum. In particular, it is not Hölder-continuous. 
0808.00671	Thickness of the strangelet-crystal crust of a strange star	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Mark G. Alford, David A. Eby	Abstract:  It has recently been pointed out that if the surface tension of quark matter is low enough, the surface of a strange star will be a crust consisting of a crystal of charged strangelets in a neutralizing background of electrons. This affects the behavior of the surface, and must be taken into account in efforts to observationally rule out strange stars. We calculate the thickness of this ``mixed phase'' crust, taking into account the effects of surface tension and Debye screening of electric charge. Our calculation uses a generic parametrization of the equation of state of quark matter. For a reasonable range of quark matter equations of state, and surface tension of order a few MeV/fm^2, we find that the preferred crystal structure always involves spherical strangelets, not rods or slabs of quark matter. We find that for a star of radius 10 km and mass 1.5 Msolar, the strangelet-crystal crust can be from zero to hundreds of meters thick, the thickness being greater when the strange quark is heavier, and the surface tension is smaller. For smaller quark stars the crust will be even thicker. 
0808.00672	Status of Lattice Studies of the QCD Phase Diagram	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Owe Philipsen (ITP, U. M\"unster)    	Abstract:  Determining the QCD phase diagram is a pressing task in view of its relevance for nuclear and astro-particle physics programmes. We review the current status of lattice calculations of the phase diagram in the (T,μ_B)-plane for baryon chemical potentials μ_B < 500 MeV. At μ_B=0, simulations of staggered fermion actions predict the quark hadron transition to be a crossover in the continuum limit. As a baryon chemical potential is turned on, there is mounting evidence on coarse lattices for the crossover to weaken, rather than turning into a true phase transition at a critical point, as predicted by earlier simulations. 
0808.00673	Pseudoscalar perturbations and polarization of the cosmic microwave background	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Maxim Pospelov, Adam Ritz, Constantinos Skordis	Abstract:  We show that models of new particle physics containing massless pseudoscalar fields super-weakly coupled to photons can be very efficiently probed with CMB polarization anisotropies. The stochastic pseudoscalar fluctuations generated during inflation provide a mechanism for converting E-mode polarization to B-mode during photon propagation from the surface of last scattering. The efficiency of this conversion process is controlled by the dimensionless ratio H/(2πf_a), where H is the Hubble scale during inflation, and f_a^{-1} is the strength of the pseudoscalar coupling to photons. The current observational limits on the B-mode constrain this ratio to be less than 0.07, which in many models of inflation translates to a sensitivity to values of f_a in excess of 10^{14} GeV, surpassing the sensitivity of other tests. 
0808.00674	CP violation of tau -> K pi(eta, eta') nu decays	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Daiji Kimura, Kang Young Lee, T. Morozumi, Keita Nakagawa	Abstract:  We study direct CP violation of tau -> K pi(eta,eta')nu decays. By studying the forward and backward asymmetry, the interference of L=0 and L=1 amplitudes of the hadronic system can be extracted. By including the scalar and vector mesons into the chiral Lagrangian, we compute the form factors which correspond to L=0 and L=1 angular momentum state of the hadronic system. We include real and imaginary parts of the one loop corrections to the self-energies of the scalar and vector mesons. The direct CP violation of the forward and backward asymmetry is computed using a two Higgs doublet model in which a new CP violating phase is introduced. We show how the CP violation of the forward and the backward asymmetry may depend on the new CP violating phase and the strong phase of the form factors. 
0808.00675	Asymptotic entanglement in open quantum systems	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Aurelian Isar	Abstract:  In the framework of the theory of open systems based on completely positive quantum dynamical semigroups, we solve in the asymptotic long-time regime the master equation for two independent harmonic oscillators interacting with an environment. We give a description of the continuous-variable asymptotic entanglement in terms of the covariance matrix of the considered subsystem for an arbitrary Gaussian input state. Using Peres--Simon necessary and sufficient condition for separability of two-mode Gaussian states, we show that for certain classes of environments the initial state evolves asymptotically to an entangled equilibrium bipartite state, while for other values of the coefficients describing the environment, the asymptotic state is separable. We calculate also the logarithmic negativity characterizing the degree of entanglement of the asymptotic state. 
0808.00676	System-bath entanglement in nanothermodynamics	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Stefanie Hilt, Eric Lutz	Abstract:  We consider a quantum harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators and evaluate the degree of entanglement between system and bath using the negativity as an exact entanglement measure. We establish the existence of a critical temperature above which the system-bath negativity vanishes. Our results imply that system-bath entanglement is not responsible for the violation of the Clausius inequality observed in the low temperature/strong coupling regime [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1799 (2000)], as the latter still occurs well above the critical temperature.

0808.00678	Evidence for the band broadening across the ferromagnetic transition in Cr$_{1/3}$NbSe$_2$	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:W. Z. Hu, G. T. Wang, Rongwei Hu, C. Petrovic, E. Morosan, R. J. Cava. Z. Fang, N. L. Wang	Abstract:  The electronic structure of Cr$_{1/3}$NbSe$_2$ is studied via optical spectroscopy. We observe two low-energy interband transitions in the paramagnetic phase, which split into four peaks as the compound enters the ferromagnetic state. The band structure calculation indicates the four peaks are interband transitions to the spin up Cr e$_g$ states. We show that the peak splitting below the Curie temperature is \emph{not} due to the exchange splitting of spin up and down bands, but directly reflects a band broadening effect in Cr-derived states upon the spontaneous ferromagnetic ordering. 
0808.00679	Quantum Cellular Automata	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:K. Wiesner	Abstract:  Quantum cellular automata (QCA) are reviewed, including early and more recent proposals. QCA are a generalization of (classical) cellular automata (CA) and in particular of reversible CA. The latter are reviewed shortly. An overview is given over early attempts by various authors to define one-dimensional QCA. These turned out to have serious shortcomings which are discussed as well. Various proposals subsequently put forward by a number of authors for a general definition of one- and higher-dimensional QCA are reviewed and their properties such as universality and reversibility are discussed. 
0808.00680	Model for Vortex-core tunneling spectroscopy of chiral p-wave superconductors via odd-frequency pairing states	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Y. Tanuma, N. Hayashi, Y. Tanaka, A.A. Golubov	Abstract:  The local density of states (LDOS) around a vortex core is studied theoretically in terms of the odd-frequency (odd-omega) Cooper pairing induced around the center of the vortex core. We find a robust zero-energy peak in the LDOS at a vortex core in a chiral p-wave superconductor originating from an odd-omega s-wave pair amplitude. We suggest how to discriminate a spin-triplet pairing symmetry and spatial chiral-domain structure by scanning tunneling spectroscopy via odd-omega pair amplitudes inside vortex cores. 
0808.00681	Spectral functions of strongly interacting isospin-1/2 bosons in one dimension	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:K. A. Matveev, A. Furusaki	Abstract:  We study a system of one-dimensional (iso)spin-1/2 bosons in the regime of strong repulsive interactions. We argue that the low-energy spectrum of the system consists of acoustic density waves and the spin excitations described by an effective ferromagnetic spin chain with a small exchange constant J. We use this description to compute the dynamic spin structure factor and the spectral functions of the system. 
0808.00682	Relativistic light-on-heavy nuclear collisions and the implied rapidity asymmetry	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Adeola Adeluyi (1), Gergely G. Barnaföldi (1 and 2), George Fai (1), Péter Lévai (2) ((1) Center for Nuclear Research, Department of Physics, Kent State University, Kent, Ohio, USA, (2) MTA KFKI RMKI Research Institute for Particle and Nuclear Physics, Budapest, Hungary)    	Abstract:  We calculate pseudorapidity ($η$) asymmetry in $pA$ and $dA$ collisions in a pQCD-improved parton model. With the calculations tuned to describe existing spectra from $pp$ collisions and asymmetric systems at midrapidity and large rapidities at FNAL and RHIC energies, we investigate the roles of nuclear shadowing and multiple scattering on the observed asymmetry. Using this framework, we make predictions for pseudorapidity asymmetries at high $p_T$ and large $η$ in a wide range of energies up to LHC. 
0808.00683	Experimental Results on Diffraction	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Pierre Van Mechelen	Abstract:  Results on diffractive scattering observed at HERA and at the TEVATRON are reviewed. This includes the extraction of diffractive parton density functions and determination of the rapidity gap survival probability at HERA and the observation of central exclusive production of final states at the TEVATRON. Finally, preparations to observe diffractive signals at the LHC are discussed. 
0808.00684	9-variable Boolean Functions with Nonlinearity 242 in the Generalized Rotation Class	Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)	Authors:Selcuk Kavut, Melek Diker Yucel	Abstract:  In 2006, 9-variable Boolean functions having nonlinearity 241, which is strictly greater than the bent concatenation bound of 240, have been discovered in the class of Rotation Symmetric Boolean Functions (RSBFs) by Kavut, Maitra and Yucel. To improve this nonlinearity result, we have firstly defined some subsets of the n-variable Boolean functions as the "generalized classes of k-RSBFs and k-DSBFs (k-Dihedral Symmetric Boolean Functions)", where k is a positive integer dividing n and k-RSBFs is a subset of l-RSBFs if k < l. Secondly, utilizing the steepest-descent like iterative heuristic search algorithm used previously to identify the 9-variable RSBFs with nonlinearity 241, we have made a search within the classes of 3-RSBFs and 3-DSBFs. The search has accomplished to find 9-variable Boolean functions with nonlinearity 242 in both of these classes. It should be emphasized that although the class of 3-RSBFs contains functions with nonlinearity 242; 1-RSBFs or simply RSBFs, which is a subset of 3-RSBFs, does not contain any. This result also shows that the covering radius of the first order Reed-Muller code R(1, 9) is at least equal to 242. Thirdly, motivated by the fact that RSBFs are invariant under a special permutation of the input vector, we have classified all possible permutations up to the linear equivalence of Boolean functions that are invariant under those permutations. Specifically, for 9-variable Boolean functions, 9! possible permutations are classified into 30 classes; and the search algorithm identifies some of these classes as "rich". The rich classes yield new Boolean functions with nonlinearity 242 having different autocorrelation spectra from those of the functions found in the generalized 3-RSBF and 3-DSBF classes. 
0808.00685	Identification of different types of kink modes in coronal loops: principles and application to TRACE results	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:T. J. Wang, S. K. Solanki, M. Selwa	Abstract:  We explore the possible observational signatures of different types of kink modes (horizontal and vertical oscillations in their fundamental mode and second harmonic) that may arise in coronal loops, with the aim of determining how well the individual modes can be uniquely identified from time series of images. A simple, purely geometrical model is constructed to describe the different types of kink-mode oscillations. These are then `observed' from a given direction. In particular, we employ the 3D geometrical parameters of 14 TRACE loops of transverse oscillations to try to identify the correct observed wave mode. We find that for many combinations of viewing and loop geometry it is not straightforward to distinguish between at least two types of kink modes just using time series of images. We also considered Doppler signatures and find that these can help obtain unique identifications of the oscillation modes when employed in combination with imaging. We then compare the modeled spatial signatures with the observations of 14 TRACE loops. We find that out of three oscillations previously identified as fundamental horizontal mode oscillations, two cases appear to be fundamental vertical mode oscillations (but possibly combined with the fundamental horizontal mode), and one case appears to be a combination of the fundamental vertical and horizontal modes, while in three cases it is not possible to clearly distinguish between the fundamental mode and the second-harmonic of the horizontal oscillation. In five other cases it is not possible to clearly distinguish between a fundamental horizontal mode and the second-harmonic of a vertical mode. 
0808.00686	Quantum cryptography with polarization, phase and time encoding	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:W.T. Buttler, S.K. Lamoreaux	Abstract:  We develop and present a quantum cryptography concept in which phase determinations are made from the time that a photon is detected, as opposed to where the photon is detected, and hence is a non-interferometric process. The phase-encoded quantum information is contained in temporal and polarization superpositions of single photon states, forming a complex qudit of Hilbert dimension D equal to or greater than 4. Based on this, we have developed a new quantum key distribution protocol that allows the generation of secret key in the presence of higher noise than is possible with other protocols. 
0808.00687	Zero temperature phase diagram of the square-shoulder system	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Gernot J. Pauschenwein, Gerhard Kahl	Abstract:  Particles that interact via a square-shoulder potential, consisting of an impenetrable hard core with an adjacent, repulsive, step-like corona, are able to self-organize in a surprisingly rich variety of rather unconventional ordered structures. Using optimization strategies that are based on ideas of genetic algorithms we encounter, as we systematically increase the pressure, the following archetypes of aggregates: low-symmetry cluster and columnar phases, followed by lamellar particle arrangements, until at high pressure values compact, high-symmetry lattices emerge. These structures are characterized in the NPT ensemble as configurations of minimum Gibbs free energy. Based on simple considerations, i.e., basically minimizing the number of overlapping coronae while maximizing at the same time the density, the sequence of emerging structures can easily be understood. 
0808.00688	Arithmetic differential operators on Z_p	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:A. Buium, C. C. Ralph, S. R. Simanca	Abstract:  We prove that a function f from Z_p to itself is analytic if and only if it can be represented as f(x)=F(x, dx, ..., d^r x) where dx=(x-x^p)/p is the Fermat quotient operator and F is a restricted power series with coefficients in Z_p. 
0808.00689	Comparing pertinent effects of antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the two and three dimensional Hubbard model	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:A. A. Katanin, A. Toschi, K. Held	Abstract:  We use the dynamical vertex approximation (D$Γ$A) with a Moriyaesque $% λ$ correction for studying the impact of antiferromagnetic fluctuations on the spectral function of the Hubbard model in two and three dimensions. Our results show the suppression of the quasiparticle weight in three dimensions and dramatically stronger impact of spin fluctuations in two dimensions where the pseudogap is formed at low enough temperatures. Even in the presence of the Hubbard subbands, the origin of the pseudogap at weak-to-intermediate coupling is in the splitting of the quasiparticle peak. At stronger coupling (closer to the insulating phase) the splitting of Hubbard subbands is expected instead. The $\mathbf{k}$-dependence of the self energy appears to be also much more pronounced in two dimensions as can be observed in the $\mathbf{k}$-resolved D$Γ$A spectra, experimentally accessible by angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy in layered correlated systems. 
0808.00690	Can the $π^+χ_{c1}$ resonance structures be $D^*\bar{D}^*$ and $D_1\bar{D}$ molecules?	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Su Houng Lee, Kenji Morita, Marina Nielsen	Abstract:  We use QCD sum rules to study the recently observed resonance-like structures in the $π^+χ_{c1}$ mass distribution, $Z_1^+(4050)$ and $Z_2^+(4250)$, considered as $D^{*+}\bar{D}^{*0}$ and $D_1^+\bar{D}^0+ D^+\bar{D}_1^0$ molecules with the quantum number $J^P=0^+$ and $J^P=1^-$ respectively. We consider the contributions of condensates up to dimension eight and work at leading order in $α_s$. We obtain $m_{D^*D^*}=(4.15\pm0.12) \GeV$, around 100 MeV above the $D^*D^*$ threshold, and $m_{D_1D}=(4.19\pm 0.22) \GeV$, around 100 MeV below the $D_1D$ threshold. We conclude that the $D^{*+}\bar{D}^{*0}$ state is probably a virtual state that is not related with the $Z_1^+(4050)$ resonance-like structure. In the case of the $D_1D$ molecular state, considering the errors, its mass is consistent with both $Z_1^+(4050)$ and $Z_2^+(4250)$ resonance-like structures. Therefore, we conclude that no definite conclusion can be drawn for this state from the present analysis. 
0808.00691	Fibre Inflation: Observable Gravity Waves from IIB String Compactifications	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:M. Cicoli, C. P. Burgess, F. Quevedo	Abstract:  We introduce a simple string model of inflation, in which the inflaton field can take trans-Planckian values while driving a period of slow-roll inflation. This leads naturally to a realisation of large field inflation, inasmuch as the inflationary epoch is well described by the single-field scalar potential $V = V_0 (3-4 e^{-\hat\varphi/\sqrt{3}})$. Remarkably, for a broad class of vacua all adjustable parameters enter only through the overall coefficient $V_0$, and in particular do not enter into the slow-roll parameters. Consequently these are determined purely by the number of \e-foldings, $N_e$, and so are not independent: $\varepsilon \simeq \frac32 η^2$. This implies similar relations among observables like the primordial scalar-to-tensor amplitude, $r$, and the scalar spectral tilt, $n_s$: $r \simeq 6(n_s - 1)^2$. $N_e$ is itself more model-dependent since it depends partly on the post-inflationary reheat history. In a simple reheating scenario a reheating temperature of $T_{rh}\simeq 10^{9}$ GeV gives $N_e\simeq 58$, corresponding to $n_s\simeq 0.970$ and $r\simeq 0.005$, within reach of future observations. The model is an example of a class that arises naturally in the context of type IIB string compactifications with large-volume moduli stabilisation, and takes advantage of the generic existence there of Kahler moduli whose dominant appearance in the scalar potential arises from string loop corrections to the Kahler potential. The inflaton field is a combination of Kahler moduli of a K3-fibered Calabi-Yau manifold. We believe there are likely to be a great number of models in this class -- `high-fibre models' -- in which the inflaton starts off far enough up the fibre to produce observably large primordial gravity waves. 
0808.00692	Proper Motions and Brightness Variations of Nonthermal X-ray Filaments in the Cassiopeia A Supernova Remnant	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Daniel J. Patnaude, Robert A. Fesen	Abstract:  We present Chandra ACIS X-ray observations of the Galactic supernova remnant Cassiopeia A taken in December 2007. Combining these data with previous archival Chandra observations taken in 2000, 2002, and 2004, we estimate the remnant's forward shock velocity at various points around the outermost shell to range between 4200 and 5200 +/- 500 km/s. Using these results together with previous analyses of Cas A's X-ray emission, we present a model for the evolution of Cas A and find that it's expansion is well fit by a rho_ej ~ r^{-(7-9)} ejecta profile running into a circumstellar wind. We further find that while the position of the reverse shock in this model is consistent with that measured in the X-rays, in order to match the forward shock velocity and radius we had to assume that ~ 30% of the explosion energy has gone into accelerating cosmic rays at the forward shock. The new X-ray images also show that brightness variations can occur for some forward shock filaments like that seen for several nonthermal filaments seen projected in the interior of the remnant. Spectral fits to exterior forward shock filaments and interior nonthermal filaments show that they exhibit similar spectra. This together with similar flux variations suggests that interior nonthermal filaments might be simply forward shock filaments seen in projection and not located at the reverse shock as has been recently proposed. 
0808.00693	Sensitivity to parameters of STIRAP in a Cooper-Pair Box	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Giuseppe Mangano, Jens Siewert, Giuseppe Falci	Abstract:  The rapid experimental progress in the field of superconducting nanocircuits gives rise to an increasing quest for advanced quantum-control techniques for these macroscopically coherent systems. Here we demonstrate theoretically that stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP), a well-established method in quantum optics, should be possible with the quantronium setup of a Cooper-pair box. We find the parameters which optimize the procedure and show how the scheme appears to be robust against decoherence and should be realizable even with the existing technology. 
0808.00694	Radiation damping, noncommutativity and duality	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:E. M. C. Abreu, A. C. R. Mendes, C. Neves, W. Oliveira	Abstract:  In this work, our main objective is to construct a N=2 supersymmetric extension of the nonrelativistic $(2+1)$-dimensional model describing the radiation damping on the noncommutative plane with scalar (electric) and vector (magnetic) interactions by the N=2 superfield technique. We also introduce a dual equivalent action to the radiation damping one using the Noether procedure. 
0808.00695	Hilbert's fourteenth problem over finite fields, and a conjecture on the cone of curves	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Burt Totaro	Abstract:  We give examples over arbitrary fields of rings of invariants that are not finitely generated. The group involved can be as small as three copies of the additive group, as in Mukai's examples over the complex numbers. The failure of finite generation comes from certain elliptic fibrations or abelian surface fibrations having positive Mordell-Weil rank. Our work suggests a generalization of the Morrison-Kawamata cone conjecture from Calabi-Yau varieties to klt Calabi-Yau pairs. We prove the conjecture in dimension 2 in the case of minimal rational elliptic surfaces. 
0808.00696	Quantization of Sine-Gordon solitons on the circle: semiclassical vs. exact results	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Michael Pawellek	Abstract:  We consider the semiclassical quantization of sine-Gordon solitons on the circle with periodic and anti-periodic boundary conditions. The 1-loop quantum corrections to the mass of the solitons are determined using zeta function regularization in the integral representation. We compare the semiclassical results with exact numerical calculations in the literature and find excellent agreement even outside the plain semiclassical regime. 
0808.00697	Measurement of the color-suppressed decays anti-B0->D(*)0 pi0 /omega/eta/eta prime branching fractions	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We report results on the branching fraction ($\mathcal{BF}$) measurement of the color-suppressed decays $\bar{B}^0\to D^0 π^0$, $D^{*0}π^0$, $D^0η$, $D^{*0}η$, $D^0ω$, $D^{*0}ω$, $D^0η^{\prime}$, and $D^{*0}η^{\prime}$. The result is based on a sample of $(454\pm 5)\times 10^{6} B\bar{B}$ pairs collected at the $Υ(4S)$ resonance from 1999 to 2007, with the $\babar$ detector at the PEP-II storage rings at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. The measurements are compared to theoretical predictions by factorization, SCET and pQCD. 
0808.00698	Observation of the Isotopic Evolution of Pressurized Water Reactor Fuel Using an Antineutrino Detector	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:N. S. Bowden, A. Bernstein, S. Dazeley, R. Svoboda, A. Misner, T. Palmer	Abstract:  By operating an antineutrino detector of simple design during several fuel cycles, we have observed long term changes in antineutrino flux that result from the isotopic evolution of a commercial Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). Measurements made with simple antineutrino detectors of this kind offer an alternative means for verifying fissile inventories at reactors, as part of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other reactor safeguards regimes. 
0808.00699	Fourier transform and middle convolution for irregular D-modules	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:D.Arinkin	Abstract:  S.Block and H.Esnault constructed the local Fourier transform for D-modules. We present a different approach to the local Fourier transform, which makes its properties almost tautological. We apply the local Fourier transform to compute the local version of Katz's middle convolution. 
0808.00700	Measurement of CP-Violating Asymmetries in the B0->K+K-Ks Dalitz Plot	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We present a preliminary measurement of CP-violation parameters in the decay B0->K+K-Ks, using approximately 465 million BBbar events collected by the BABAR detector at SLAC. Reconstructing the neutral kaon as Ks->pi+pi- or Ks->pi0pi0, we analyze the Dalitz plot distribution and measure fractions to intermediate states. We extract CP parameters from the asymmetries in amplitudes and phases between B0 and B0bar decays across the Dalitz plot. From a fit to the whole Dalitz plot, we measure beta_eff = 0.44 +/- 0.07 +/- 0.02, A_CP = 0.03 +/- 0.07 +/- 0.02, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second ones are systematic. For decays to phiKs, we measure beta_eff = 0.13 +/- 0.13 +/- 0.02, A_CP = 0.14 +/- 0.19 +/- 0.02. For decays to f0Ks, we measure beta_eff = 0.15 +/- 0.13 +/- 0.03, A_CP = 0.01 +/- 0.26 +/- 0.07. From a fit to the region of the Dalitz plot with m_{K+K-}>1.1 GeV/c^2, we measure beta_eff = 0.52 +/- 0.08 +/- 0.03, A_CP = 0.05 +/- 0.09 +/- 0.04. 
0808.00701	Effective theory for the cosmological generation of structure	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Martin Bojowald, Aureliano Skirzewski	Abstract:  The current understanding of structure formation in the early universe is mainly built on a magnification of quantum fluctuations in an initial vacuum state during an early phase of accelerated universe expansion. One usually describes this process by solving equations for a quantum state of matter on a given expanding background space-time, followed by decoherence arguments for the emergence of classical inhomogeneities from the quantum fluctuations. Here, we formulate the coupling of quantum matter fields to a dynamical gravitational background in an effective framework which allows the inclusion of back-reaction effects. It is shown how quantum fluctuations couple to classical inhomogeneities and can thus manage to generate cosmic structure in an evolving background. Several specific effects follow from a qualitative analysis of the back-reaction, including a likely reduction of the overall amplitude of power in the cosmic microwave background, the occurrence of small non-Gaussianities, and a possible suppression of power for odd modes on large scales without parity violation. 
0808.00702	Unifying cosmological and recent time variations of fundamental couplings	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Thomas Dent, Steffen Stern, Christof Wetterich	Abstract:  A number of positive and null results on the time variation of fundamental constants have been reported. It is difficult to judge whether or not these claims are mutually consistent, since the observable quantities depend on several parameters, namely the coupling strengths and masses of particles. The evolution of these coupling-parameters over cosmological history is also a priori unknown. A direct comparison requires a relation between the couplings. We explore several distinct scenarios based on unification of gauge couplings, providing a representative (though not exhaustive) sample of such relations. For each scenario we obtain a characteristic time dependence and discuss whether a monotonic time evolution is allowed. For all scenarios, some contradictions between different observations appear. We show how a clear observational determination of non-zero variations would test the dominant mechanism of varying couplings within unified theories. 
0808.00703	Observation of ZZ production in ppbar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:D0 Collaboration: V. Abazov, et al    	Abstract:  We present an observation for ZZ -> l+l-l'+l'- (l, l' = e or mu) production in ppbar collisions at a center-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV. Using 1.7 fb-1 of data collected by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider, we observe three candidate events with an expected background of 0.14 +0.03 -0.02 events. The significance of this observation is 5.3 standard deviations. The combination of D0 results in this channel, as well as in ZZ -> l+l-nunubar, yields a significance of 5.7 standard deviations and a combined cross section of sigma(ZZ) = 1.60 +/- 0.63 (stat.) +0.16 -0.17 (syst.) pb. 
0808.00704	Spin-independent elastic WIMP scattering and the DAMA annual modulation signal	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Malcolm Fairbairn, Thomas Schwetz	Abstract:  We discuss the interpretation of the annual modulation signal seen in the DAMA experiment in terms of spin-independent elastic WIMP scattering. Taking into account channeling in the crystal as well as the spectral signature of the modulation signal we find that the low-mass WIMP region consistent with DAMA data is confined to WIMP masses close to $m_χ\simeq 12$ GeV, in disagreement with the constraints from CDMS and XENON. We conclude that even if channeling is taken into account this interpretation of the DAMA modulation signal is disfavoured. There are no overlap regions in the parameter space at 90% CL and a consistency test gives the probability of $1.2\times 10^{-5}$. We study the robustness of this result with respect to variations of the WIMP velocity distribution in our galaxy, by changing various parameters of the distribution function, and by using the results of a realistic N-body dark matter simulation. We find that only by making rather extreme assumptions regarding halo properties can we obtain agreement between DAMA and CDMS/XENON. 
0808.00705	Strong and radiative decays of the scalars f0(980) and a0(980) in a hadronic molecule approach	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Tanja Branz, Thomas Gutsche, Valery E. Lyubovitskij	Abstract:  We analyze the electromagnetic and strong decay properties of the light scalars a0(980) and f0(980) within a hadronic molecule interpretation. Both scalars are discussed within a covariant and gauge invariant model which also allows for finite size effects due to their spatially extended structure in the K Kbar-bound state picture. Allowing for f0-a0 mixing we also study its influence on the radiative decays f0/a0 to gamma gamma, f0/a0 to gamma omega, and f0/a0 to gamma rho as well as the phi production of the f0 and a0. Furthermore, we apply our formalism to describe the strong f0 to pi pi and a0 to pi eta decay properties. 
0808.00706	Gravity Waves and Linear Inflation from Axion Monodromy	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Liam McAllister, Eva Silverstein, Alexander Westphal	Abstract:  Wrapped branes in string compactifications introduce a monodromy that extends the field range of individual closed-string axions to beyond the Planck scale. Furthermore, approximate shift symmetries of the system naturally control corrections to the axion potential. This suggests a general mechanism for chaotic inflation driven by monodromy-extended closed-string axions. We systematically analyze this possibility and show that the mechanism is compatible with moduli stabilization and can be realized in many types of compactifications, including warped Calabi-Yau manifolds and more general Ricci-curved spaces. In this broad class of models, the potential is linear in the canonical inflaton field, predicting a tensor to scalar ratio r=0.07 accessible to upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. 
0808.00707	Low Energy Probes of CP Violation in a Flavor Blind MSSM	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:W. Altmannshofer, A.J. Buras, P. Paradisi	Abstract:  We analyze the low energy implications of a flavor blind supersymmetric scenario (where the CKM matrix is the only source of flavor violation) in the presence of new CP violating but flavor conserving phases in the soft sector. We find that the best probes of this rather restricted scenario are i) the electric dipole moments (EDMs) of the electron (d_e) and the neutron (d_n) and ii) flavor changing and CP violating processes in B systems, like the CP asymmetries in b->s gamma and B->phi(eta^')K_S, i.e. A_CP(b->s gamma) and S_phi(eta^')K_S, respectively. The non-standard values for S_phi(eta^')K_S, measured at the B factories, can find a natural explanation within our scenario and this would unambiguously imply i) positive and often large (non-standard) values for A_CP(b->s gamma) and ii) a lower bound for the electron and neutron EDMs at the level of d_e,n > 10^-28 e cm. Moreover, we predict positive New Physics (NP) contributions to epsilon_K which could be welcomed in view of the recently lowered Standard Model value for epsilon_K. Interestingly, an explanation for the non-standard values for S_phi(eta^')K_S can also naturally lead to an explanation for the anomaly of the muon anomalous magnetic moment. Finally, we outline the role and the interplay of the direct NP searches at the LHC with the indirect searches performed by low energy flavor physics observables. 
0808.00708	Local antiferromagnetic correlations in the iron pnictide superconductors LaFeAsO{1-x}F{x} and Ca(Fe,Co)2As2 as seen via normal-state susceptibility	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:R. Klingeler, N. Leps, I. Hellmann, A. Popa, U. Stockert, C. Hess, V. Kataev, H.-J. Grafe, F. Hammerath, G. Lang, G. Behr, L. Harnagea, S. Singh, B. Buechner	Abstract:  We have studied the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in LaFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ and Ca(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$. While antiferromagnetic spin density wave formation is suppressed and superconductivity evolves, all samples show a doping independent strong increase of the normal state susceptibility upon heating which appears a general feature of iron pnictides. The data provide evidence for robust local antiferromagnetic correlations persisting even in the superconducting regime of the phase diagram. 
0808.00709	Fine Structure of Avalanches in the Abelian Sandpile Model	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Amir Abdolvand, Afshin Montakhab	Abstract:  We study the two-dimensional Abelian Sandpile Model on a square lattice of linear size L. We introduce the notion of avalanche's fine structure and compare the behavior of avalanches and waves of toppling. We show that according to the degree of complexity in the fine structure of avalanches, which is a direct consequence of the intricate superposition of the boundaries of successive waves, avalanches fall into two different categories. We propose scaling ansätz for these avalanche types and verify them numerically. We find that while the first type of avalanches has a simple scaling behavior, the second (complex) type is characterized by an avalanche-size dependent scaling exponent. This provides a framework within which one can understand the failure of a consistent scaling behavior in this model. 
0808.00710	Trans-Debye Scale Plasma Modeling & Stochastic GRB Wakefield Plasma Processes	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. Trier Frederiksen, T. Haugboelle, A. Nordlund	Abstract:  Modeling plasma physical processes in astrophysical context demands for both detailed kinetics and large scale development of the electromagnetic field densities. We present a new framework for modeling plasma physics of hot tenuous plasmas by a two-split scheme, in which the large scale fields are modeled by means of a particle-in-cell (PIC) code, and in which binary collision processes and single-particle processes are modeled through a Monte-Carlo approach. Our novel simulation tool -- the PhotonPlasma code -- is a unique hybrid model; it combines a highly parallelized (Vlasov) particle-in-cell approach with continuous weighting of particles and a sub-Debye Monte-Carlo binary particle interaction framework. As an illustration of the capabilities we present results from a numerical study of Gamma-Ray Burst - Circumburst Medium interaction and plasma preconditioning via Compton scattering. We argue that important microphysical processes can only viably be investigated by means of hybrid codes such as the PhotonPlasma code. Our first results from 3D simulations with this new simulation tool suggest that magnetic fields and plasma filaments are created in the wakefield of prompt gamma-ray bursts. Furthermore, the photon flux density gradient impacts on particle acceleration in the burst head and wakefield. We discuss some possible implications of the circumburst medium being preconditioned for a trailing afterglow shock front. We also discuss important improvements for future studies of GRB wakefields processes, using the PhotonPlasma code. 
0808.00711	Support union recovery in high-dimensional multivariate regression	Machine Learning (stat.ML)	Authors:Guillaume Obozinski, Martin J. Wainwright, Michael I. Jordan	Abstract:  In multivariate regression, a $K$-dimensional response vector is regressed upon a common set of $p$ covariates, with a matrix $B^*\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times K}$ of regression coefficients. We study the behavior of the multivariate group Lasso, in which block regularization based on the $\ell_1/\ell_2$ norm is used for support union recovery, or recovery of the set of $s$ rows for which $B^*$ is nonzero. Under high-dimensional scaling, we show that the multivariate group Lasso exhibits a threshold for the recovery of the exact row pattern with high probability over the random design and noise that is specified by the sample complexity parameter $θ(n,p,s):=n/[2ψ(B^*)\log(p-s)]$. Here $n$ is the sample size, and $ψ(B^*)$ is a sparsity-overlap function measuring a combination of the sparsities and overlaps of the $K$-regression coefficient vectors that constitute the model. We prove that the multivariate group Lasso succeeds for problem sequences $(n,p,s)$ such that $θ(n,p,s)$ exceeds a critical level $θ_u$, and fails for sequences such that $θ(n,p,s)$ lies below a critical level $θ_{\ell}$. For the special case of the standard Gaussian ensemble, we show that $θ_{\ell}=θ_u$ so that the characterization is sharp. The sparsity-overlap function $ψ(B^*)$ reveals that, if the design is uncorrelated on the active rows, $\ell_1/\ell_2$ regularization for multivariate regression never harms performance relative to an ordinary Lasso approach and can yield substantial improvements in sample complexity (up to a factor of $K$) when the coefficient vectors are suitably orthogonal. For more general designs, it is possible for the ordinary Lasso to outperform the multivariate group Lasso. We complement our analysis with simulations that demonstrate the sharpness of our theoretical results, even for relatively small problems. 
0808.00712	Origin and consequence of an unpinned helical magnet: application to partial order in MnSi under pressure	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:John M. Hopkinson, Hae-Young Kee	Abstract:  We study a classical ferromagnetic Heisenberg model in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions on the corner-shared triangle lattice formed by the Mn sites of MnSi. We show that a sizable spin helicity can be obtained only when the microscopic Moriya vectors lie parallel to the Mn-Mn bonds. Further, such vectors are shown to produce an unpinned helical order characterized by a particular ordering wavevector magnitude but unpinned direction, dubbed partial order, at physically realizable temperatures. A consequence of such an unpinned helical ordering is that the neutron scattering intensity is sharply peaked at this wavevector magnitude. The surface formed by connecting these wavevectors is a sphere, around which the neutron scattering weight is spread. We further show that the observed neutron scattering intensity can be anisotropic along this surface and that this anisotropy is dependent on the experimentalist's choice of lattice Bragg peak through a geometric factor. A neutron scattering measurement near the Bragg point ($\frac{2π}{a}$,$\frac{2π}{a}$,0) naturally leads to a highest intensity along the (1,1,0) direction consistent with the observed anisotropy in MnSi [Pfleiderer {\it{et al.}} Nature {\bf{427}} 227 (2004)]. A possible mechanism for pinning the helical order, and a way to distinguish an ordered and a partially ordered state in the context of neutron scattering are discussed. 
0808.00713	Comparison of Numerical and Post-Newtonian Waveforms for Generic Precessing Black-Hole Binaries	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Manuela Campanelli, Carlos O. Lousto, Hiroyuki Nakano, Yosef Zlochower	Abstract:  We compare waveforms and orbital dynamics from the first long-term, fully non-linear, numerical simulations of a generic black-hole binary configuration with post-Newtonian predictions. The binary has mass ratio q~0.8 with arbitrarily oriented spins of magnitude S_1/m_1^2~0.6 and S_2/m_2^2~0.4 and orbits 9 times prior to merger. The numerical simulation starts with an initial separation of r~11M, with orbital parameters determined by initial 2.5PN and 3.5PN post-Newtonian evolutions of a quasi-circular binary with an initial separation of r=50M. The resulting binaries have very little eccentricity according to the 2.5PN and 3.5PN systems, but show significant eccentricities of e~0.01-0.02 and e~0.002-0.005 in the respective numerical simulations, thus demonstrating that 3.5PN significantly reduces the eccentricity of the binary compared to 2.5PN. We perform three numerical evolutions from r~11M with maximum resolutions of h=M/48,M/53.3,M/59.3, to verify numerical convergence. We observe a reasonably good agreement between the PN and numerical waveforms, with an overlap of nearly 99% for the first six cycles of the (l=2,m=+-2) modes, 91% for the (l=2,m=+-1) modes, and nearly 91% for the (l=3,m=+-3) modes. The phase differences between numerical and post-Newtonian approximations appear to be independent of the (l,m) modes considered and relatively small for the first 3-4 orbits. An advantage of the 3.5 PN model over the 2.5 PN one seems to be observed, which indicates that still higher PN order (perhaps even 4.0PN) may yield significantly better waveforms. In addition, we identify features in the waveforms likely related to precession and precession-induced eccentricity. 
0808.00714	Determining the extragalactic extinction law with SALT	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ido Finkelman (TAU), Noah Brosch (TAU), Alexei Y. Kniazev (SALT), David Buckley (SALT), Darragh O'Donoghue (SALT), Yas Hashimoto (SALT), Nicola Loaring (SALT), Encarni Romero (SALT), Martin Still (SALT), Petri Vaisanen (SALT)    	Abstract:  We present CCD imaging observations of early-type galaxies with dark lanes obtained with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) during its performance-verification phase. We derive the extinction law by the extragalactic dust in the dark lanes in the spectral range 1.11mu m^{-1} < lambda^{-1} < 2.94 mu m^{-1} by fitting model galaxies to the unextinguished parts of the image, and subtracting from these the actual images. We find that the extinction curves run parallel to the Galactic extinction curve, which implies that the properties of dust in the extragalactic enviroment are similar to those of the Milky Way. The ratio of the total V band extinction to the selective extinction between the V and B bands is derived for each galaxy with an average of 2.82+-0.38, compared to a canonical value of 3.1 for the Milky Way. The similar values imply that galaxies with well-defined dark lanes have characteristic dust grain sizes similar to those of Galactic dust. 
0808.00715	From Kadanoff-Baym dynamics to off-shell parton transport	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:W. Cassing (U. Giessen)    	Abstract:  This review provides a written version of the lectures presented at the Schladming Winter School 2008, Austria, on 'Nonequilibrium Aspects of Quantum Field Theory'. In particular, it shows the way from quantum-field theory - in two-particle irreducible approximation - to the Kadanoff-Baym (KB) equations and various approximations schemes of the KB equations in phase space. This ultimately leads to the formulation of an off-shell transport theory that well incorporates the underlying quantum physics. Remarkably, these transport equations may be solved within a testparticle representation that allows to study non-equilibrium quantum systems in the weak and strong coupling regime. Actual applications to dilepton production in heavy-ion reactions are presented in comparison with available data. The approach, furthermore, allows to address the hadronization process from partonic to hadronic degrees of freedom. 
0808.00716	Bulge Formation by the Coalescence of Giant Clumps in Primordial Disk Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Bruce G. Elmegreen (1), Frederic Bournaud (2), Debra Meloy Elmegreen (3) ((1) IBM Watson Research Center, (2) Laboratoire AIM, CEA-Saclay, (3) Vassar College)    	Abstract:  Gas-rich disks in the early universe are highly turbulent and have giant star-forming clumps. Models suggest the clumps form by gravitational instabilities, and if they resist disruption by star formation, then they interact, lose angular momentum, and migrate to the center to form a bulge. Here we study the properties of the bulges formed by this mechanism. They are all thick, slowly rotating, and have a high Sersic index, like classical bulges. Their rapid formation should also give them relatively high alpha-element abundances. We consider fourteen low-resolution models and four high-resolution models, three of which have supernova feedback. All models have an active halo, stellar disk, and gaseous disk, three of the models have a pre-existing bulge and three others have a cuspy dark matter halo. All show the same basic result except the one with the highest feedback, in which the clumps are quickly destroyed and the disk thickens too much. The coalescence of massive disk clumps in the center of a galaxy is like a major merger in terms of orbital mixing. It differs by leaving a bulge with no specific dark matter component, unlike the merger of individual galaxies. Normal supernova feedback has little effect because the high turbulent speed in the gas produces tightly bound clumps. A variety of indirect observations support the model, including clumpy disks with young bulges at high redshift and bulges with relatively little dark matter. 
0808.00717	New estimates for the length of the Erdos-Herzog-Piranian lemniscate	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Alexander Fryntov, Fedor Nazarov	Abstract:  Let p(z) be a monic polynomial of degree n. Consider the lemniscate L={z:|p(z)|=1}. It has been conjectured that L has the largest length when p(z)=z^n-1. We show that the length of L attains a local maximum at this polynomial and prove the asymptotically sharp bound |L|<2n+o(n). 
0808.00718	Suppression of Magnetic Order by Pressure in BaFe2As2	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:H. Fukazawa, N. Takeshita, T. Yamazaki, K. Kondo, K. Hirayama, Y. Kohori, K. Miyazawa, H. Kito, H. Eisaki, A. Iyo	Abstract:  We performed the dc resistivity and the ZF 75As-NMR measurement of BaFe2As2 under high pressure. The T-P phase diagram of BaFe2As2 determined from resistivity anomalies and the ZF 75As-NMR clearly revealed that the SDW anomaly is quite robust against P. 
0808.00719	Pair Production of Two-Higgs-Doublet_Model Light Higgs Bosons in $γγ$ Collisions	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Fernando Cornet, Wolfgang Hollik	Abstract:  We study the production of a pair of light, neutral, CP-even Higgs bosons in photon--photon collisions within the general Two Higgs Doublet Model (THDM). This is a process for which the lowest order contribution in both, the Standard Model and the THDM, appears at one loop. We find that the cross section for this process can be much larger in the THDM than in the Standard Model and the number of events expected at the Photon Collider will allow a determination of some of the parameters in the scalar potential. 
0808.00720	Global geometry under isotropic Brownian flows	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Sreekar Vadlamani, Robert J. Adler	Abstract:  We consider global geometric properties of a codimension one manifold embedded in Euclidean space, as it evolves under an isotropic and volume preserving Brownian flow of diffeomorphisms. In particular, we obtain expressions describing the expected rate of growth of the Lipschitz-Killing curvatures, or intrinsic volumes, of the manifold under the flow. These results shed new light on some of the intriguing growth properties of flows from a global perspective, rather than the local perspective, on which there is a much larger literature. 
0808.00721	SDSS J120923.7+264047: A new massive galaxy cluster with a bright giant arc	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Eran O. Ofek, Stella Seitz, Felix Klein	Abstract:  Highly magnified lensed galaxies allow us to probe the morphological and spectroscopic properties of high-redshift stellar systems in great detail. However, such objects are rare, and there are only a handful of lensed galaxies which are bright enough for a high-resolution spectroscopic study with current instrumentation. We report the discovery of a new massive lensing cluster, SDSS J120923.7+264047, at z=0.558. Present around the cluster core, at angular distances of up to ~40'', are many arcs and arc candidates, presumably due to lensing of background galaxies by the cluster gravitational potential. One of the arcs, 21'' long, has an r-band magnitude of 20, making it one of the brightest known lensed galaxies. We obtained a low-resolution spectrum of this galaxy, using the Keck-I telescope, and found it is at redshift of z=1.018. 
0808.00722	Insufficiency of the Quantum State for Deducing Observational Probabilities	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Don N. Page	Abstract:  It is usually assumed that the quantum state is sufficient for deducing all probabilities for a system. This may be true when there is a single observer, but it is not true in a universe large enough that there are many copies of an observer. Then the probability of an observation cannot be deduced simply from the quantum state (say as the expectation value of the projection operator for the observation, as in traditional quantum theory). One needs additional rules to get the probabilities. What these rules are is not logically deducible from the quantum state, so the quantum state itself is insufficient for deducing observational probabilities. This is the measure problem of cosmology. 
0808.00723	ODE, RDE and SDE Models of Cell Cycle Dynamics and Clustering in Yeast	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Erik M. Boczko, Tomas Gedeon, Chris C. Stowers, Todd Young	Abstract:  Biologists have long observed periodic-like oxygen consumption oscillations in yeast populations under certain conditions and several unsatisfactory explanations for this phenomenon have been proposed. These "autonomous oscillations" have often appeared with periods that are nearly integer divisors of the calculated doubling time of the culture. We hypothesize that these oscillations could be caused by a weak form of cell cycle synchronization that we call clustering. We develop some novel ordinary differential equation models of the cell cycle. For these models, and for random and stochastic perturbations, we give both rigorous proofs and simulations showing that both positive and negative growth rate feedback within the cell cycle are possible agents that can cause clustering of populations within the cell cycle. It occurs for a variety of models and for a broad selection of parameter values. These results suggest that the clustering phenomenon is robust and is likely to be observed in nature. Since there are necessarily an integer number of clusters, clustering would lead to periodic-like behavior with periods that are nearly integer divisors of the period of the cell cycle. 
0808.00724	On the ring structure of spark characters	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Ning Hao	Abstract:  We give a new description of the ring structure on the differential characters of a smooth manifold via the smooth hyperspark complex. We show the explicit product formula, and as an application, calculate the product for differential characters of the unit circle. Applying the presentation of spark classes by smooth hypersparks, we give an explicit construction of the isomorphism between groups of spark classes and the $(p,p)$ part of smooth Deligne cohomology groups associated to a smooth manifold. We then give a new direct proof that this is an isomorphism of ring structures. 
0808.00725	Petal-shape probability areas: complete quantum state discrimination	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Luis Roa, Carla Hermann-Avigliano, Roberto Salazar, A. B. Klimov, B. Burgos, A. Delgado	Abstract:  We find the allowed complex numbers associated with the inner product of N equally separated pure quantum states. The allowed areas on the unitary complex plane have the form of petals. A point inside the petal-shape represents a set of N linearly independent (LI) pure states, and a point on the edge of that area represents a set of N linearly dependent (LD) pure states. For each one of those LI sets we study the complete discrimination of its N equi-separated states combining sequentially the two known strategies: first the unambiguous identification protocol for LI states, followed, if necessary, by the error-minimizing measurement scheme for LD states. We find that the probabilities of success for both unambiguous and ambiguous discrimination procedures depend on both the module and the phase of the involved inner product complex number. We show that, with respect to the phase-parameter, the maximal probability of discriminating unambiguously the N non-orthogonal pure states holds just when there no longer be probability of obtaining ambiguously information about the prepared state by applying the second protocol if the first one was not successful. 
0808.00726	Mixing and CP Violation at the Tevatron	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:G. Brooijmans (on behalf of the CDF and D0 Collaborations)    	Abstract:  Measurements of meson mixing and CP violation parameters obtained by the CDF and D0 experiments at the Fermilab Tevatron are presented. These include results on $B_s$ and $D$ meson mixing, and searches for CP violation in the decay $B^+ \to J/ψK^+$, in mixing through semileptonic $B_s$ meson decays, and in the interference between mixing and decay in the process $B_s \to J/ψ φ$. 
0808.00727	Conformal weldings and Dispersionless Toda hierarchy	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Lee-Peng Teo	Abstract:  Given a $C^1$ homeomorphism of the unit circle $γ$, let $f$ and $g$ be respectively the normalized conformal maps from the unit disc and its exterior so that $γ= g^{-1}\circ f$ on the unit circle. In this article, we show that by suitably defined time variables, the evolutions of the pairs $(g, f)$ and $(g^{-1}, f^{-1})$ can be described by an infinite set of nonlinear partial differential equations known as dispersionless Toda hierarchy. Relations to the integrable structure of conformal maps first studied by Wiegmann and Zabrodin \cite{WZ} are discussed. An extension of the hierarchy which contains both our solution and the solution of \cite{WZ} is defined. 
0808.00728	SUSY Searches at the Tevatron	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:T. Adams (for the CDF and D0 collaborations)    	Abstract:  Numerous searches for evidence of supersymmetry at the Tevatron have been performed by the CDF and D0 collaborations. Recent results are presented here including squarks and gluinos in jets and missing transverse energy, stop in several different decay modes, charginos and neutralinos in trileptons, neutralinos in di-photons, R-parity violating sneutrinos in e+mu events, and long-lived particles. These explore many variations of SUSY such as MSSM, mSUGRA, and GMSB. While no evidence of SUSY production is observed, 95% CL limits on cross sections and SUSY parameter space are set. Most of these limits are the world's best. 
0808.00729	An approximation to density functional theory for an accurate calculation of band-gaps of semiconductors	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Luiz G. Ferreira, Marcelo Marques, Lara K. Teles	Abstract:  The local-density approximation (LDA), together with the half-occupation (transition state) is notoriously successful in the calculation of atomic ionization potentials. When it comes to extended systems, such as a semiconductor infinite system, it has been very difficult to find a way to half-ionize because the hole tends to be infinitely extended (a Bloch wave). The answer to this problem lies in the LDA formalism itself. One proves that the half-occupation is equivalent to introducing the hole self-energy (electrostatic and exchange-correlation) into the Schroedinger equation. The argument then becomes simple: the eigenvalue minus the self-energy has to be minimized because the atom has a minimal energy. Then one simply proves that the hole is localized, not infinitely extended, because it must have maximal self-energy. Then one also arrives at an equation similar to the SIC equation, but corrected for the removal of just 1/2 electron. Applied to the calculation of band gaps and effective masses, we use the self-energy calculated in atoms and attain a precision similar to that of GW, but with the great advantage that it requires no more computational effort than standard LDA. 
0808.00730	Trees = Networks ?!?	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:Luciano da Fontoura Costa, Francisco Aparecido Rodrigues	Abstract:  This work addresses the intrinsic relationship between trees and networks (i.e. graphs). A complete (invertible) mapping is presented which allows trees to be mapped into weighted graphs and then backmapped into the original tree without loss of information. The extension of this methodology to more general networks, including unweighted structures, is also discussed and illustrated. It is shown that the identified duality between trees and graphs underlies several key concepts and issues of current interest in complex networks, including comprehensive characterization of trees and community detection. For instance, additional information about tree structures (e.g. phylogenetic trees) can be immediately obtained by taking into account several off-the-shelf network measurements -- such as the clustering coefficient, degree correlations and betweenness centrality. At the same time, the hierarchical structure of networks, including the respective communities, becomes clear when the network is represented in terms of the respective tree. Indeed, the network-tree mapping described in this work provides a simple and yet effective means of community detection. 
0808.00731	Coherent control near metallic nanostructures	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Ilya Grigorenko, Anatoly Efimov	Abstract:  We study coherent control in the vicinity of metallic nanostructures. Unlike in the case of control in gas or liquid phase, the collective response of electrons in a metallic nanostructure can significantly enhance different frequency components of the control field. This enhancement strongly depends on the geometry of the nanostructure and can substantially modify the temporal profile of the local control field. The changes in the amplitude and phase of the control field near the nanostructure are studied using linear response theory. The inverse problem of finding the external electromagnetic field to generate the desired local control field is considered and solved. 
0808.00732	Dynamics, robustness and fragility of trust	Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)	Authors:Dusko Pavlovic	Abstract:  Trust is often conveyed through delegation, or through recommendation. This makes the trust authorities, who process and publish trust recommendations, into an attractive target for attacks and spoofing. In some recent empiric studies, this was shown to lead to a remarkable phenomenon of *adverse selection*: a greater percentage of unreliable or malicious web merchants were found among those with certain types of trust certificates, then among those without. While such findings can be attributed to a lack of diligence in trust authorities, or even to conflicts of interest, our analysis of trust dynamics suggests that public trust networks would probably remain vulnerable even if trust authorities were perfectly diligent. The reason is that the process of trust building, if trust is not breached too often, naturally leads to power-law distributions: the rich get richer, the trusted attract more trust. The evolutionary processes with such distributions, ubiquitous in nature, are known to be robust with respect to random failures, but vulnerable to adaptive attacks. We recommend some ways to decrease the vulnerability of trust building, and suggest some ideas for exploration. 
0808.00733	LaMnO$_3$ is a Mott Insulator: an precise definition and an evaluation of the local interaction strength	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Chungwei Lin, Andrew.J.Millis	Abstract:  We compare the interaction parameters measured on LaMnO$_3$ to single site dynamical mean field estimates of the critical correlation strength needed to drive a Mott transition, finding that the total correlation strength (electron-electron plus electron-lattice) is very close to but slightly larger than the critical value, while if the electron lattice interaction is neglected the model is metallic. Our results emphasize the importance of additional physics including the buckling of the Mn-O-Mn bonds. 
0808.00734	From Equilibrium to Transport Properties of Strongly Correlated Fermi Liquids	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Thomas Schaefer (North Carolina State University)    	Abstract:  We summarize recent results regarding the equilibrium and non-equilibrium behavior of cold dilute atomic gases in the limit in which the two body scattering length a goes to infinity. In this limit the system is described by a Galilean invariant (non-relativistic) conformal field theory. We discuss the low energy effective lagrangian appropriate to the limit a->infinity, and compute low energy coefficients using an epsilon-expansion. We also show how to combine the effective lagrangian with kinetic theory in order to compute the shear viscosity, and compare the kinetic theory predictions to experimental results extracted from the damping of collective modes in trapped Fermi gases. 
0808.00735	Neutrino Astrophysics	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:W. C. Haxton	Abstract:  I review the current status of neutrino astrophysics, including solar neutrinos; atmospheric neutrinos; neutrino mass and oscillations; supernova neutrinos; neutrino nucleosynthesis (Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the neutrino process, the r-process); neutrino cooling and red giants; and high energy neutrino astronomy. 
0808.00736	Theoretical Description of Pseudocubic Manganites	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Chungwei Lin, Andrew.J.Millis	Abstract:  A comprehensive theoretical model for the bulk manganite system La$_{1-x}$(Ca,Sr)$_x$MnO$_3$ is presented. The model includes local and cooperative Jahn-Teller distortions and the on-site Coulomb and exchange interaction. The model is is solved in the single-site dynamical mean field approximation using a solver based on the semiclassical approximation. The model semi-quantitatively reproduces the observed phase diagram for the doping $0 \leq x<0.5$ and implies that the manganites are in the strong coupling region but close to Mott insulator/metal phase boundary. The results establish a formalism for use in a broader range of calculations, for example on heterostructures. 
0808.00737	Nonradiative Recombination of Excitons in Carbon Nanotubes Mediated by Free Charge Carriers	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:J.M. Kinder, E.J. Mele	Abstract:  Free electrons or holes can mediate the nonradiative recombination of excitons in carbon nanotubes. Kinematic constraints arising from the quasi one-dimensional nature of excitons and charge carriers lead to a thermal activation barrier for the process. However, a model calculation suggests that the rate for recombination mediated by a free electron is the same order of magnitude as that of two-exciton recombination. Small amounts of doping may contribute to the short exciton lifetimes and low quantum yields observed in carbon nanotubes. 
0808.00738	Breakdown of the Schmid law in bcc molybdenum related to the effect of shear stress perpendicular to the slip direction	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:R. Gröger, V. Vitek	Abstract:  The breakdown of the Schmid law in bcc metals has been known for a long time. The asymmetry of shearing in the slip direction <111> in the positive and negative sense, respectively, commonly identified with the twinning-antitwinning asymmetry, is undoubtedly one of the reasons. However, effect of stress components other than the shear stress in the slip direction may be important. In this paper we investigate by atomistic modeling the effect of shear stresses perpendicular to the Burgers vector on the glide of a/2<111> screw dislocations. We show that these shear stresses can significantly elevate or reduce the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) in the direction of the Burgers vector needed for the dislocation motion, i.e. the Peierls stress. This occurs owing to the changes of the core induced by these stresses. This effect may be the reason why slip systems with smaller Schmid factors may be preferred over that with the largest Schmid factor. 
0808.00739	Boolean formulae, hypergraphs and combinatorial topology	Algebraic Topology (math.AT)	Authors:James Conant, Oliver Thistlethwaite	Abstract:  With a view toward studying the homotopy type of spaces of Boolean formulae, we introduce a simplicial complex, called the theta complex, associated to any hypergraph, which is the Alexander dual of the more well-known independence complex. In particular, the set of satisfiable formulae in k-conjunctive normal form with less than or equal to n variables has the homotopy type of Theta(Cube(n,n-k)), where Cube(n,n-k) is a hypergraph associated to the (n-k)-skeleton of an n-cube. We make partial progress in calculating the homotopy type of theta for these cubical hypergraphs, and we also give calculations and examples for other hypergraphs as well. Indeed studying the theta complex of hypergraphs is an interesting problem in its own right. 
0808.00740	Theory of Manganite Superlattice	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Chungwei Lin, Andrew.J.Millis	Abstract:  A theoretical model is proposed for the (0,0,1) superlattice manganite system (LaMnO$_3$)$_n$(SrMnO$_3$)$_m$. The model includes the electron-electron, electron-phonon, and cooperative Jahn-Teller interactions. It is solved using a version of single-site the dynamical mean field approximation generalized to incorporate the cooperative Jahn-Teller effect. The phase diagram and conductivities are calculated. The behavior of the superlattice is found to a good approximation to be an average over the density-dependent properties of individual layers, with the density of each layer fixed by electrostatics. 
0808.00741	Logarithm laws and shrinking target properties	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Jayadev S. Athreya	Abstract:  We survey some of the recent developments in the study of logarithm laws and shrinking target properties for various families of dynamical systems. We discuss connections to geometry, diophantine approximation, and probability theory. 
0808.00742	Rigid irregular connections on P^1	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:D.Arinkin	Abstract:  N.Katz's middle convolution algorithm provides a description of rigid connections on the projective line with regular singularities. We extend the algorithm by adding the Fourier transform to it. The extended algorithm provides a description of rigid connections with arbitrary singularities. 
0808.00743	Kerr nonlinearities and nonclassical states with superconducting qubits and nanomechanical resonators	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:F. L. Semião, K. Furuya, G. J. Milburn	Abstract:  We propose the use of a superconducting charge qubit capacitively coupled to two resonant nanomechanical resonators to generate Yurke-Stoler states, i.e. quantum superpositions of pairs of distinguishable coherent states 180$^\circ$ out of phase with each other. This is achieved by effectively implementing Kerr nonlinearities induced through application of a strong external driving field in one of the resonators. A simple study of the effect of dissipation on our scheme is also presented, and lower bounds of fidelity and purity of the generated state are calculated. Our procedure to implement a Kerr nonlinearity in this system may be used for high precision measurements in nanomechanical resonators. 
0808.00744	First order magnetic transition in single crystal CaFe$_2$As$_2$ detected by $^{75}$As NMR	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:S.-H. Baek, N. J. Curro, T. Klimczuk, E. D. Bauer, F. Ronning, J. D. Thompson	Abstract:  We report $^{75}$As Nuclear Magnetic Resonance data in a single crystal of CaFe$_2$As$_2$. The Knight shift, electric field gradient, and spin-lattice relaxation rate are strongly temperature dependent in the paramagnetic state, and change discontinuously at the structural transition temperature, $T_S=T_N=167$ K. Immediately below, the NMR spectra reveal an internal field at the As site associated with the presence of a commensurate magnetic order. These results indicate that the structural and magnetic transitions in CaFe$_2$As$_2$ are first order and strongly coupled, and that the electron density in the FeAs plane is highly sensitive to the out-of-plane structure. 
0808.00745	Relay-Assisted User Scheduling in Wireless Networks with Hybrid-ARQ	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Caleb K. Lo, John J. Hasenbein, Sriram Vishwanath, Robert W. Heath Jr	Abstract:  This paper studies the problem of relay-assisted user scheduling for downlink wireless transmission. The base station or access point employs hybrid automatic-repeat-request (HARQ) with the assistance of a set of fixed relays to serve a set of mobile users. By minimizing a cost function of the queue lengths at the base station and the number of retransmissions of the head-of-line packet for each user, the base station can schedule an appropriate user in each time slot and an appropriate transmitter to serve it. It is shown that a priority-index policy is optimal for a linear cost function with packets arriving according to a Poisson process and for an increasing convex cost function where packets must be drained from the queues at the base station. 
0808.00746	String Gas Cosmology	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Robert H. Brandenberger (McGill University)    	Abstract:  String gas cosmology is a string theory-based approach to early universe cosmology which is based on making use of robust features of string theory such as the existence of new states and new symmetries. A first goal of string gas cosmology is to understand how string theory can effect the earliest moments of cosmology before the effective field theory approach which underlies standard and inflationary cosmology becomes valid. String gas cosmology may also provide an alternative to the current standard paradigm of cosmology, the inflationary universe scenario. Here, the current status of string gas cosmology is reviewed.

Gratta	Abstract:  Anti-neutrino emission rates from nuclear reactors are determined from thermal power measurements and fission rate calculations. The uncertainties in these quantities for commercial power plants and their impact on the calculated interaction rates in electron anti-neutrino detectors is examined. We discuss reactor-to-reactor correlations between the leading uncertainties and their relevance to reactor anti-neutrino experiments. 
0808.00748	Communication in XYZ All-to-All Quantum Networks with a Missing Link	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Sougato Bose, Andrea Casaccino, Stefano Mancini, Simone Severini	Abstract:  We explicitate the relation between Hamiltonians for networks of interacting qubits in the XYZ model and graph Laplacians. We then study evolution in networks in which all sites can communicate with each other. These are modeled by the complete graph K_{n} and called all-to-all networks. It turns out that K_{n} does not exhibit perfect state transfer (PST). However, we prove that deleting an edge in K_{n} allows PST between the two non-adjacent sites, when n is a multiple of four. An application is routing a qubit over n different sites, by switching off the link between the sites that we wish to put in communication. Additionally, we observe that, in certain cases, the unitary inducing evolution in K_{n} is equivalent to the Grover operator. 
0808.00749	Surface tension in an intrinsic curvature model with fixed one-dimensional boundaries	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Hiroshi Koibuchi	Abstract:  A triangulated fixed connectivity surface model is investigated by using the Monte Carlo simulation technique. In order to have the macroscopic surface tension τ, the vertices on the one-dimensional boundaries are fixed as the edges (=circles) of the tubular surface in the simulations. The size of the tubular surface is chosen such that the projected area becomes the regular square of area A. An intrinsic curvature energy with a microscopic bending rigidity b is included in the Hamiltonian. We found that the model undergoes a first-order transition of surface fluctuations at finite b, where the surface tension τdiscontinuously changes. The gap of τremains constant at the transition point in a certain range of values A/N^\prime at sufficiently large N^\prime, which is the total number of vertices excluding the fixed vertices on the boundaries. The value of τremains almost zero in the wrinkled phase at the transition point while τremains negative finite in the smooth phase in that range of A/N^\prime. 
0808.00750	SDE in Random Population Growth	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:Raouf Ghomrasni, Lisa Bonney	Abstract:  In this paper we extend the recent work of C.A. Braumann \cite{B2007} to the case of stochastic differential equation with random coefficients. Furthermore, the relationship of the Itô-Stratonovich stochastic calculus to studies of random population growth is also explained. 
0808.00751	Effects of epidemic threshold definition on disease spread statistics	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:C. Lagorio, M. V. Migueles, L. A. Braunstein, E. López, P. A. Macri	Abstract:  We study the statistical properties of the SIR epidemics in heterogeneous networks, when an epidemic is defined as only those SIR propagations that reach or exceed a minimum size s_c. Using percolation theory to calculate the average fractional size <M_SIR> of an epidemic, we find that the strength of the spanning link percolation cluster $P_{\infty}$ is an upper bound to <M_SIR>. For small values of s_c, $P_{\infty}$ is no longer a good approximation, and the average fractional size has to be computed directly. The value of s_c for which $P_{\infty}$ is a good approximation is found to depend on the transmissibility T of the SIR. We also study Q, the probability that an SIR propagation reaches the epidemic mass s_c, and find that it is well characterized by percolation theory. We apply our results to real networks (DIMES and Tracerouter) to measure the consequences of the choice s_c on predictions of average outcome sizes of computer failure epidemics.

Gurtas	Abstract:  A positive Dehn twist product for a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ action with $g+2$ fixed points on the 2-dimensional closed, compact, oriented surface $Σ_g$ is presented. The homeomorphism invariants of the resulting symplectic 4-manifolds are computed. 
0808.00753	Ranking Catamorphisms and Unranking Anamorphisms on Hereditarily Finite Datatypes	Symbolic Computation (cs.SC)	Authors:Paul Tarau	Abstract:  Using specializations of unfold and fold on a generic tree data type we derive unranking and ranking functions providing natural number encodings for various Hereditarily Finite datatypes. In this context, we interpret unranking operations as instances of a generic anamorphism and ranking operations as instances of the corresponding catamorphism. Starting with Ackerman's Encoding from Hereditarily Finite Sets to Natural Numbers we define pairings and tuple encodings that provide building blocks for a theory of Hereditarily Finite Functions. The more difficult problem of ranking and unranking Hereditarily Finite Permutations is then tackled using Lehmer codes and factoradics. The self-contained source code of the paper, as generated from a literate Haskell program, is available at \url{this http URL}.

0808.00754	A Functional Hitchhiker's Guide to Hereditarily Finite Sets, Ackermann Encodings and Pairing Functions	Mathematical Software (cs.MS)	Authors:Paul Tarau	Abstract:  The paper is organized as a self-contained literate Haskell program that implements elements of an executable finite set theory with focus on combinatorial generation and arithmetic encodings. The code, tested under GHC 6.6.1, is available at this http URL . We introduce ranking and unranking functions generalizing Ackermann's encoding to the universe of Hereditarily Finite Sets with Urelements. Then we build a lazy enumerator for Hereditarily Finite Sets with Urelements that matches the unranking function provided by the inverse of Ackermann's encoding and we describe functors between them resulting in arithmetic encodings for powersets, hypergraphs, ordinals and choice functions. After implementing a digraph representation of Hereditarily Finite Sets we define {\em decoration functions} that can recover well-founded sets from encodings of their associated acyclic digraphs. We conclude with an encoding of arbitrary digraphs and discuss a concept of duality induced by the set membership relation.

0808.00755	The kinematic footprints of five stellar streams in Andromeda's halo	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. C. Chapman, R. Ibata, M. Irwin, A. Koch, B. Letarte, N. Martin, M. Collins, G. F. Lewis, A. McConnachie, J. Penarrubia, R. M. Rich, D. Trethewey, A. M. N. Ferguson, A. Huxor, N. Tanvir	Abstract:  (abridged) We present a spectroscopic analysis of five stellar streams (`A', `B', `Cr', `Cp' and `D') as well as the extended star cluster, EC4, which lies within streamC, all discovered in the halo of M31 from our CFHT/MegaCam survey. These spectroscopic results were initially serendipitous, making use of our existing observations from the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph mounted on the Keck II telescope, and thereby emphasizing the ubiquity of tidal streams that account for ~70% of the M31 halo stars in the targeted fields. Subsequent spectroscopy was then procured in streamCr/p and streamD to trace the velocity gradient along the streams. For the cluster EC4, candidate member stars with average [Fe/H]~-1.4 (Fe/H_spec=-1.6), are found at v_{hel}=-285 km/s suggesting it could be related to streamCp. No similarly obvious cold kinematic candidate is found for streamD, although candidates are proposed in both of two spectroscopic pointings along the stream (both at -400 km/s). Spectroscopy near the edge of streamB suggests a likely kinematic detection, while a candidate kinematic detection of streamA is found (plausibly associated to M33 rather than M31). The low dispersion of the streams in kinematics, physical thickness, and metallicity makes it hard to reconcile with a scenario whereby these stream structures as an ensemble are related to the giant southern stream. We conclude that the M31 stellar halo is largely made up of multiple kinematically cold streams.

Furthermore, Grassmann numbers are defined in a way that makes literal sense. 
0808.00757	The properties of penumbral microjets inclination	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. Jurcak, Y. Katsukawa	Abstract:  We investigate the dependence of penumbral microjets inclination on the position within penumbra. The high cadence observations taken on 10 November 2006 with the Hinode satellite through the \ion{Ca}{ii} H and G--band filters were analysed to determine the inclination of penumbral microjets. The results were then compared with the inclination of the magnetic field determined through the inversion of the spectropolarimetric observations of the same region. The penumbral microjet inclination is increasing towards the outer edge of the penumbra. The results suggest that the penumbral microjet follows the opening magnetic field lines of a vertical flux tube that creates the sunspot. 
0808.00758	Evaluation of the Theoretical Uncertainties in the W to Lepton and Neutrino Cross Sections at the LHC	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Nadia E. Adam, Valerie Halyo, Scott A. Yost, Wenhan Zhu	Abstract:  We study the sources of systematic errors in the measurement of the W to lepton and neutrino cross-sections at the LHC. We consider the systematic errors in both the total cross-section and acceptance for anticipated experimental cuts. We include the best available analysis of QCD effects at NNLO in assessing the effect of higher order corrections and PDF and scale uncertainties on the theoretical acceptance. In addition, we evaluate the error due to missing NLO electroweak corrections and propose which MC generators and computational schemes should be implemented to best simulate the events. 
0808.00759	Rapidly spinning massive black holes in active galactic nuclei: evidence from the black hole mass function	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Xinwu Cao, Fan Li	Abstract:  The comparison of the black hole mass function (BHMF) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) relics with the measured mass function of the massive black holes in galaxies provides strong evidence for the growth of massive black holes being dominated by mass accretion. We derive the Eddington ratio distributions as functions of black hole mass and redshift from a large AGN sample with measured Eddington ratios given by Kollmeier et al. We find that, even at the low mass end, most black holes are accreting at Eddington ratio ~0.2, which implies that the objects accreting at extremely high rates should be rare or such phases are very short. Using the derived Eddington ratios, we explore the cosmological evolution of massive black holes with an AGN bolometric luminosity function (LF). It is found that the resulted BHMF of AGN relics is unable to match the measured local BHMF of galaxies for any value of (constant) radiative efficiency. Motivated by Volonteri, Sikora & Lasota's study on the spin evolution of massive black holes, we assume the radiative efficiency to be dependent of black hole mass, i.e., it is low for M<10^8 solar masses and it increases with black hole mass for black holes with >10^8 solar masses. We find that the BHMF of AGN relics can roughly reproduce the local BHMF of galaxies if the radiative efficiency ~0.08 for the black holes with <10^8 solar masses and it increases to ~0.18 for black holes with >10^9 solar masses, which implies that most massive black holes (>10^9 solar masses) are spinning very rapidly. 
0808.00760	Declarative Combinatorics: Boolean Functions, Circuit Synthesis and BDDs in Haskell	Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)	Authors:Paul Tarau	Abstract:  We describe Haskell implementations of interesting combinatorial generation algorithms with focus on boolean functions and logic circuit representations. First, a complete exact combinational logic circuit synthesizer is described as a combination of catamorphisms and anamorphisms. Using pairing and unpairing functions on natural number representations of truth tables, we derive an encoding for Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) with the unique property that its boolean evaluation faithfully mimics its structural conversion to a a natural number through recursive application of a matching pairing function. We then use this result to derive ranking and unranking functions for BDDs and reduced BDDs. Finally, a generalization of the encoding techniques to Multi-Terminal BDDs is provided. The paper is organized as a self-contained literate Haskell program, available at this http URL . Keywords: exact combinational logic synthesis, binary decision diagrams, encodings of boolean functions, pairing/unpairing functions, ranking/unranking functions for BDDs and MTBDDs, declarative combinatorics in Haskell 
0808.00761	Effective superpotentials for compact D5-brane Calabi-Yau geometries	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Hans Jockers, Masoud Soroush	Abstract:  For compact Calabi-Yau geometries with D5-branes we study N=1 effective superpotentials depending on both open- and closed-string fields. We develop methods to derive the open/closed Picard-Fuchs differential equations, which control D5-brane deformations as well as complex structure deformations of the compact Calabi-Yau space. Their solutions encode the flat open/closed coordinates and the effective superpotential. For two explicit examples of compact D5-brane Calabi-Yau hypersurface geometries we apply our techniques and express the calculated superpotentials in terms of flat open/closed coordinates. By evaluating these superpotentials at their critical points we reproduce the domain wall tensions that have recently appeared in the literature. Finally we extract orbifold disk invariants from the superpotentials, which, up to overall numerical normalizations, correspond to orbifold disk Gromov-Witten invariants in the mirror geometry. 
0808.00762	On the Convergence of Optimal Measures	Complex Variables (math.CV)	Authors:T. Bloom, L. Bos, N. Levenberg, S. Waldron	Abstract:  Using recent results of Berman and Boucksom we show that for a non-pluripolar compact set K in C^d and an admissible weight function w=e^{-φ} any sequence of so-called optimal measures converges weak-* to the equilibrium measure μ_{K,φ} of (weighted) Pluripotential Theory for K,φ. 
0808.00763	Experimental mathematics on the magnetic susceptibility of the square lattice Ising model	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:S. Boukraa, A. J. Guttmann, S. Hassani, I. Jensen, J.-M. Maillard, B. Nickel, N. Zenine	Abstract:  We calculate very long low- and high-temperature series for the susceptibility $χ$ of the square lattice Ising model as well as very long series for the five-particle contribution $χ^{(5)}$ and six-particle contribution $χ^{(6)}$. These calculations have been made possible by the use of highly optimized polynomial time modular algorithms and a total of more than 150000 CPU hours on computer clusters. For $χ^{(5)}$ 10000 terms of the series are calculated {\it modulo} a single prime, and have been used to find the linear ODE satisfied by $χ^{(5)}$ {\it modulo} a prime. A diff-Padé analysis of 2000 terms series for $χ^{(5)}$ and $χ^{(6)}$ confirms to a very high degree of confidence previous conjectures about the location and strength of the singularities of the $n$-particle components of the susceptibility, up to a small set of ``additional'' singularities. We find the presence of singularities at $w=1/2$ for the linear ODE of $χ^{(5)}$, and $w^2= 1/8$ for the ODE of $χ^{(6)}$, which are {\it not} singularities of the ``physical'' $χ^{(5)}$ and $χ^{(6)},$ that is to say the series-solutions of the ODE's which are analytic at $w =0$. Furthermore, analysis of the long series for $χ^{(5)}$ (and $χ^{(6)}$) combined with the corresponding long series for the full susceptibility $χ$ yields previously conjectured singularities in some $χ^{(n)}$, $n \ge 7$. We also present a mechanism of resummation of the logarithmic singularities of the $χ^{(n)}$ leading to the known power-law critical behaviour occurring in the full $χ$, and perform a power spectrum analysis giving strong arguments in favor of the existence of a natural boundary for the full susceptibility $χ$. 
0808.00764	Skein theory for the D_{2n} planar algebras	Quantum Algebra (math.QA)	Authors:Scott Morrison, Emily Peters, Noah Snyder	Abstract:  We give a combinatorial description of the ``$D_{2n}$ planar algebra,'' by generators and relations. We explain how the generator interacts with the Temperley-Lieb braiding. This shows the previously known braiding on the even part extends to a `braiding up to sign' on the entire planar algebra. We give a direct proof that our relations are consistent (using this `braiding up to sign'), give a complete description of the associated tensor category and principal graph, and show that the planar algebra is positive definite. These facts allow us to identify our combinatorial construction with the standard invariant of the subfactor $D_{2n}$. 
0808.00765	Tensorial hydrodynamic slip	Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)	Authors:Martin Z. Bazant, Olga I. Vinogradova	Abstract:  We describe a tensorial generalization of the Navier slip boundary condition and illustrate its use in solving for flows around anisotropic textured surfaces. Tensorial slip can be derived from molecular or microstructural theories or simply postulated as an constitutive relation, subject to certain general constraints on the interfacial mobility. The power of the tensor formalism is to capture complicated effects of surface anisotropy, while preserving a simple fluid domain. This is demonstrated by exact solutions for laminar shear flow and pressure-driven flow between parallel plates of arbitrary and different textures. From such solutions, the effects of rotating a texture follow from simple matrix algebra. Our results may be useful to extracting local slip tensors from global measurements, such as the permeability of a textured channel or the force required to move a patterned surface, in experiments or simulations. 
0808.00766	Dynamics of k-core percolation in a random graph	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Mami Iwata, Shin-ichi Sasa	Abstract:  We study the edge deletion process of random graphs near a k-core percolation point. We find that the time-dependent number of edges in the process exhibits critically divergent fluctuations. We first show theoretically that the k-core percolation point is exactly given as the saddle-node bifurcation point in a dynamical system. We then determine all the exponents for the divergence based on a universal description of fluctuations near the saddle-node bifurcation.

Raju	Abstract:  We formulate the 2-body problem of electrodynamics using functional differential equations, and explain the peculiar features of these equations which indicate a paradigm shift in physics. We examine the possible empirical existence of advanced interactions using various absorber theories of radiation. Functional differential equations were connected to quantum mechanics in a subsequent paper in this series and in later publications. 
0808.00768	Foundations of Information Theory	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Mark Burgin	Abstract:  Information is the basic concept of information theory. However, there is no definition of this concept that can encompass all uses of the term information in information theories and beyond. Many question a possibility of such a definition. However, foundations of information theory developed in the context of the general theory of information made it possible to build such a relevant and at the same time, encompassing definition. Foundations of information theory are built in a form of ontological principles, which reflect basic features of information and information processes. 
0808.00769	The correlation of black hole mass with metallicity index of host spheroid	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Shota Kisaka, Yasufumi Kojima, Yosuke Otani	Abstract:  We investigate the correlation between the mass of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and metal abundance, using existing data sets. The SMBH mass $M_{bh}$ is well correlated with integrated stellar feature of Mgb. For 28 galaxies, the best-fit $M_{bh}$-Mgb relation has a small scatter, which is an equivalent level with other well-known relation, such as a correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion and the mass. An averaged iron index $<$Fe$>$ also positively correlates with $M_{bh}$, but the best-fit $M_{bh}$-$<$Fe$>$ relation has a larger scatter. The difference comes from the synthesis and evolution mechanisms, and may be important for the SMBH and star formation history in the host spheroid. 
0808.00770	Discovery potential of the next-to-minimal supergravity-motivated model	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Csaba Balazs, Daniel Carter	Abstract:  Applying a likelihood analysis to the next-to-minimal supergravity-motivated model, we identify parameter space regions preferred by present experimental limits from collider, astrophysical, and low energy measurements. We then show that favored regions are amenable to detection by a combination of the CERN Large Hadron Collider and an upgraded Cryogenic Dark Matter Search, provided that the more than three sigma discrepancy in the difference of the experimental and the standard theoretical values of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon prevails in the future. 
0808.00771	Electromagnetic Productions of KLambda and KSigma on the Nucleons	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:T. Mart	Abstract:  We briefly review the progress and problems in the electromagnetic production of KLambda on the nucleon. The problem of the data discrepancy in this channel as well as the corresponding physics consequence are highlighted. We also discuss the effect of the new beam-recoil polarization data Cx and Cz on our analysis. For this purpose we use the isobar model Kaon-Maid and a recent multipoles model that can describe recent experimental data. We also present a new multipoles model for the KSigma channels to complete our analysis. 
0808.00772	Low-Density Instability of Multi-Component Matter with Trapped Neutrinos	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:T. Mart, A. Sulaksono	Abstract:  The effect of neutrino trapping on the longitudinal dielectric function at low densities has been investigated by using different relativistic mean field models. Parameter sets G2 of Furnstahl-Serot-Tang and Z271 of Horowitz-Piekarewicz, along with the adjusted parameter sets of both models, have been used in this study. The role of the isovector adjustment and the effect of the Coulomb interaction have been also studied. The effect of the isovector adjustment is found to be more significant in the Horowitz-Piekarewicz model, not only in the neutrinoless matter, but also in the matter with neutrino trapping. Although almost independent to the variation of the leptonic fraction, the instability region of matter with neutrino trapping is found to be larger. The presence of more protons and electrons compared to the neutrinoless case is the reason behind this finding. For parameter sets with soft equation of states at low density, the appearance of a large and negative epsilon_L (q, q0 = 0) in some parts of the edge of the instability region in matter with neutrino trapping is understood as a consequence of the fact that the Coulomb interaction produced by electrons and protons interaction is larger than the repulsive isovector interaction created by the asymmetry between the proton and neutron numbers. 
0808.00773	A Necessary Condition for Individual Time-Steps in SPH Simulations	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Takayuki R.Saitoh, Junichiro Makino	Abstract:  We show that the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, used with individual time-steps in the way described in the literature, cannot handle strong explosion problems correctly. In the individual time-step scheme, particles determine their time-steps essentially from a local Courant condition. Thus they cannot respond to a strong shock, if the pre-shock timescale is too long compared to the shock timescale. This problem is not severe in SPH simulations of galaxy formation with a temperature cutoff in the cooling function at $10^4 {\rm K}$, while it is very dangerous for simulations in which the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium under $10^4 {\rm K}$ is taken into account. A solution for this problem is to introduce a time-step limiter which reduces the time-step of a particle if it is too long compared to the time-steps of its neighbor particles. Thus this kind of time-step constraint is essential for the correct treatment of explosions in high-resolution SPH simulations with individual time-steps. 
0808.00774	Elementary Techniques for Erdos-Ko-Rado-like Theorems	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Greg Brockman, Bill Kay	Abstract:  The well-known Erdos-Ko-Rado Theorem states that if F is a family of k-element subsets of {1,2,...,n} (n>2k-1) such that every pair of elements in F has a nonempty intersection, then |F| is at most $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$. The theorem also provides necessary and sufficient conditions for attaining the maximum. We present elementary methods for deriving generalizations of the Erdos-Ko-Rado Theorem on several classes of combinatorial objects. We also extend our results to systems under Hamming intersection. 
0808.00775	R&D progress on second-generation crystals for Laue lens applications	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:N. Barrière, P. von Ballmoos, P. Bastie, P. Courtois, N. V. Abrosimov, K. Andersen, T. Buslaps, T. Camus, H. Halloin, M. Jentschel, J. Knodlseder, G. Roudil, D. Serre, G. Skinner	Abstract:  The concept of a gamma-ray telescope based on a Laue lens offers the possibility to increase the sensitivity by more than an order of magnitude with respect to existing instruments. Laue lenses have been developed by our collaboration for several years : the main achievement of this R&D program was the CLAIRE lens prototype. Since then, the endeavour has been oriented towards the development of efficient diffracting elements (crystal slabs), the aim being to step from a technological Laue lens to a scientifically exploitable lens. The latest mission concept featuring a gamma-ray lens is the European Gamma-Ray Imager (GRI) which intends to make use of the Laue lens to cover energies from 200 keV to 1300 keV. Investigations of two promising materials, low mosaicity copper and gradient concentration silicon-germanium are presented in this paper. The measurements have been performed during three runs on beamline ID15A of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, and on the GAMS 4 instrument of the Institute Laue-Langevin (both in Grenoble, France) using highly monochromatic beam of energy close to 500 keV. Despite it was not perfectly homogeneous, the presented copper crystal exhibits peak reflectivity of 25% in accordance with theoretical predictions, and a mosaicity around 26 arcsec, the ideal range for the realization of a Laue lens such as GRI. Silicon-germanium featuring a constant gradient have been measured for the very first time at 500 keV. Two samples showed a quite homogeneous reflectivity reaching 26%, which is far from the 48% already observed in experimental crystals but a very encouraging beginning. This results have been used to estimate the performance of the GRI Laue lens design. 
0808.00776	Experimental Measurement of Lower and Upper Bounds of Concurrence for Mixed Quantum States	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Xiao-Ling Niu, Yan-Xiao Gong, Jian Li, Liang Peng, Cheng-Jie Zhang, Yong-Sheng Zhang, Yun-Feng Huang, Guang-Can Guo	Abstract:  We experimentally measure the lower and upper bounds of concurrence for a set of two-qubit mixed quantum states using photonic systems. The measured concurrence bounds are in agreement with the results evaluated from the density matrices reconstructed through quantum state tomography. In our experiment, we propose and demonstrate a simple method to provide two faithful copies of a two-photon mixed state required for parity measurements: Two photon pairs generated by two neighboring pump laser pulses through optical parametric down conversion processes represent two identical copies. This method can be conveniently generalized for entanglement estimation of multi-photon mixed states. 
0808.00777	A Conversation with Peter Huber	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:Andreas Buja, Hans R. Künsch	Abstract:  Peter J. Huber was born on March 25, 1934, in Wohlen, a small town in the Swiss countryside. He obtained a diploma in mathematics in 1958 and a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1961, both from ETH Zurich. His thesis was in pure mathematics, but he then decided to go into statistics. He spent 1961--1963 as a postdoc at the statistics department in Berkeley where he wrote his first and most famous paper on robust statistics, ``Robust Estimation of a Location Parameter.'' After a position as a visiting professor at Cornell University, he became a full professor at ETH Zurich. He worked at ETH until 1978, interspersed by visiting positions at Cornell, Yale, Princeton and Harvard. After leaving ETH, he held professor positions at Harvard University 1978--1988, at MIT 1988--1992, and finally at the University of Bayreuth from 1992 until his retirement in 1999. He now lives in Klosters, a village in the Grisons in the Swiss Alps. Peter Huber has published four books and over 70 papers on statistics and data analysis. In addition, he has written more than a dozen papers and two books on Babylonian mathematics, astronomy and history. In 1972, he delivered the Wald lectures. He is a fellow of the IMS, of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1988 he received a Humboldt Award and in 1994 an honorary doctorate from the University of Neuchâtel. In addition to his fundamental results in robust statistics, Peter Huber made important contributions to computational statistics, strategies in data analysis, and applications of statistics in fields such as crystallography, EEGs, and human growth curves. 
0808.00778	Double quantum dot as detector of spin bias	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Qing-feng Sun, Yanxia Xing, Shun-Qing Shen	Abstract:  It was proposed that a double quantum dot can be used to be a detector of spin bias. Electron transport through a double quantum dot is investigated theoretically when a pure spin bias is applied on two conducting leads contacted to the quantum dot. It is found that the spin polarization in the left and right dots may be induced spontaneously while the intra-dot levels are located within the spin bias window and breaks the left-right symmetry of the two quantum dots. As a result, a large current emerges. For an open external circuit an charge bias instead of a charge current will be induced in equilibrium, which is believed to be measurable according to the current nanotechnology. This method may provide a practical and whole electrical approach to detect the spin bias (or the spin current) by measuring the charge bias or current in a double quantum dot. 
0808.00779	Two elementary proofs of the Wigner theorem on symmetry in quantum mechanics	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:R. Simon, N. Mukunda, S. Chaturvedi, V. Srinivasan	Abstract:  In quantum theory, symmetry has to be defined necessarily in terms of the family of unit rays, the state space. The theorem of Wigner asserts that a symmetry so defined at the level of rays can always be lifted into a linear unitary or an antilinear antiunitary operator acting on the underlying Hilbert space. We present a proof of this theorem which is both elementary and economical. Central to our proof is the recognition that a given Wigner symmetry can, by post-multiplication by a unitary symmetry, be taken into either the identity or complex conjugation. Our analysis involves a judicious interplay between the effect a given Wigner symmetry has on certain two-dimensional subspaces and the effect it has on the entire Hilbert space. 
0808.00780	LLE with low-dimensional neighborhood representation	Machine Learning (stat.ML)	Authors:Yair Goldberg, Ya'acov Ritov	Abstract:  The local linear embedding algorithm (LLE) is a non-linear dimension-reducing technique, widely used due to its computational simplicity and intuitive approach. LLE first linearly reconstructs each input point from its nearest neighbors and then preserves these neighborhood relations in the low-dimensional embedding. We show that the reconstruction weights computed by LLE capture the high-dimensional structure of the neighborhoods, and not the low-dimensional manifold structure. Consequently, the weight vectors are highly sensitive to noise. Moreover, this causes LLE to converge to a linear projection of the input, as opposed to its non-linear embedding goal. To overcome both of these problems, we propose to compute the weight vectors using a low-dimensional neighborhood representation. We prove theoretically that this straightforward and computationally simple modification of LLE reduces LLE's sensitivity to noise. This modification also removes the need for regularization when the number of neighbors is larger than the dimension of the input. We present numerical examples demonstrating both the perturbation and linear projection problems, and the improved outputs using the low-dimensional neighborhood representation.

0808.00782	Comment on "Learning to Build the Bomb"	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:Ahmad Shariati	Abstract:  According to Alisa Carrigan's opinion in Physics Today Dec 2007, to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons, certain rules should be set to prevent the spread of a particular kind of knowledge. Here, I argue that a knowledge blockade does not work, and it is not a suitable means to establish a sustainable peace. 
0808.00783	Growth rate and extinction rate of a reaction diffusion equation with a singular nonlinearity	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Kin Ming Hui	Abstract:  We prove the growth rate of global solutions of the equation $u_t=Δ u-u^{-ν}$ in $\R^n\times (0,\infty)$, $u(x,0)=u_0>0$ in $\R^n$, where $ν>0$ is a constant. More precisely for any $0<u_0\in C(\R^n)$ satisfying $A_1(1+|x|^2)^{α_1}\le u_0\le A_2(1+|x|^2)^{α_2}$ in $\R^n$ for some constants $1/(1+ν)\leα_1<1$, $α_2\geα_1$ and $A_2\ge A_1= (2α_1(1-\3)(n+2α_1-2))^{-1/(1+ν)}$ where $0<\3<1$ is a constant, the global solution $u$ exists and satisfies $A_1(1+|x|^2+b_1t)^{α_1}\le u(x,t)\le A_2(1+|x|^2+b_2t)^{α_2}$ in $\R^n\times (0,\infty)$ where $b_1=2(n+2α_1-2)\3$ and $b_2=2n$ if $0<α_2\le 1$ and $b_2=2(n+2α_2-2)$ if $α_2>1$. We also find various conditions on the initial value for the solution to extinct in a finite time and obtain the corresponding decay rate of the solution near the extinction time. 
0808.00784	Spin Nernst effect and Nernst effect in two-dimensional electron systems	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Shu-guang Cheng, Yanxia Xing, Qing-feng Sun, X. C. Xie	Abstract:  We study the Nernst effect and the spin Nernst effect, that a longitudinal thermal gradient induces a transverse voltage and a spin current. A mesoscopic four-terminal cross-bar device having the Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) under a perpendicular magnetic field is considered. For zero SOI, the Nernst coefficient peaks when the Fermi level crosses the Landau Levels. In the presence of the SOI, the Nernst peaks split, and the spin Nernst effect appears and exhibits a series of oscillatory structures. The larger SOI is or the weaker magnetic field is, the more pronounced the spin Nernst effect is. The results also show that the Nernst and spin Nernst coefficients are sensitive to the detailed characteristics of the sample and the contacts. In addition, the Nernst effect is found to survive in strong disorder than the spin Nernst effect does. 
0808.00785	Chevalley Supergroups	Rings and Algebras (math.RA)	Authors:R. Fioresi, F. Gavarini	Abstract:  In the framework of algebraic supergeometry, we give a construction of the scheme-theoretic supergeometric analogue of Chevalley groups, namely affine algebraic supergroups associated to simple Lie superalgebras of classical type. In particular both basic (even exceptional) and strange cases are covered. This provides a unified approach to most of the algebraic supergroups considered so far in literature, and an effective method to construct new ones. As an intermediate step, we prove an existence theorem for Chevalley bases of simple classical Lie superalgebras and a PBW-like theorem for their associated Kostant superalgebras. 
0808.00786	Ab-initio band structure of doped graphene	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:C. Attaccalite, A. Grüeneis, T. Pichler, A. Rubio	Abstract:  We present an \emph{ab-initio} study of the graphene quasi-particle band structure as function of the doping in G_0 W_0 approximation. We show that the LDA Fermi velocity is substantially renormalized and this renormalization rapidly decreases as function of the doping. We found, in agreement with previous papers, that close to the Dirac point the linear dispersion of the bands is broken but this behaviour disappears with a small doping. We discuss our results in the light of recent experiments on graphene and intercalate graphite. 
0808.00787	Relative Yamabe invariant and c-concordant metrics	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Emmanuel Humbert (IECN)    	Abstract:  We show a surgery formula for the relative Yamabe invariant and give applications to the study of concordance classes of metrics. 
0808.00788	A complex-angle rotation and geometric complementarity in fermion mixing	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Kee-Hwan Nam, Kim Siyeon, Seungsu Hwang	Abstract:  The mixing among flavors in quarks or leptons in terms of a single rotation angle is defined such that three flavor eigenvectors are transformed into three mass eigenvectors by a single rotation about a common axis. We propose that a geometric complementarity condition exists between the complex angle of quarks and that of leptons in $\mathbb{C}^2$ space. The complementarity constraint has its rise in quark-lepton unification and is reduced to the correlation among $θ_{12}, θ_{23}, θ_{13}$ and the CP phase $δ$. The CP phase turns out to have a non-trivial dependence on all the other angles. We will show that further precise measurements in real angles can narrow down the allowed region of $δ$. In comparison with other complementarity schemes, this geometric one can avoid the problem of the $θ_{13}$ exception and can naturally keep the lepton basis being independent of quark basis. 
0808.00789	On positivity in algebras of tempered generalized functions	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Eberhard Mayerhofer	Abstract:  An explicit counterexample shows that contrary to the situation in the special Colombeau algebra, positivity and invertibility cannot be characterized pointwise in algebras of tempered generalized functions. Further a point value characterization of the latter is refined. 
0808.00790	Nuclear structure of Ac-231	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:R. Boutami, M. J. G. Borge, H. Mach, W. Kurcewicz, L. M. Fraile, K. Gulda, A. J. Aas, L. M. García-Raffi, G. Løvhøiden, T. Martínez, B. Rubio, J. L. Taín, O. Tengblad	Abstract:  The low-energy structure of 231Ac has been investigated by means of gamma ray spectroscopy following the beta-decay of 231Ra. Multipolarities of 28 transitions have been established by measuring conversion electrons with a mini-orange electron spectrometer. The decay scheme of 231Ra --> 231Ac has been constructed for the first time. The Advanced Time Delayed beta-gamma-gamma(t) method has been used to measure the half-lives of five levels. The moderately fast B(E1) transition rates derived suggest that the octupole effects, albeit weak, are still present in this exotic nucleus.

0808.00793	Self-Regulated Fueling of Galaxy Centers: Evidence for Star-Formation Feedback in IC342's Nucleus	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:E. Schinnerer (MPIA), T. Boeker (ESTEC), D.S. Meier (NRAO), D. Calzetti (UMASS)    	Abstract:  Using new, high-resolution interferometric observations of the CO and HCN molecules, we directly compare the molecular and ionized components of the interstellar medium in the center of the nearby spiral galaxy IC342, on spatial scales of ~ 10pc. The morphology of the tracers suggests that the molecular gas flow caused by a large-scale stellar bar has been strongly affected by the mechanical feedback from recent star formation activity within the central 100pc in the nucleus of the galaxy. Possibly, stellar winds and/or supernova shocks originating in the nuclear star cluster have compressed, and likely pushed outward, the infalling molecular gas, thus significantly reducing the gas supply to the central 10pc. Although our analysis currently lacks kinematic confirmation due to the face-on orientation of IC342, the described scenario is supported by the generally observed repetitive nature of star formation in the nuclear star clusters of late-type spiral galaxies. 
0808.00794	Understanding photonic quantum-logic gates: The road to fault tolerance	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Till J. Weinhold, Alexei Gilchrist, Kevin J. Resch, Andrew C. Doherty, Jeremy L. O'Brien, Geoffrey J. Pryde, Andrew G. White	Abstract:  Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires gates which function correctly despite the presence of errors, and are scalable if the error probability-per-gate is below a threshold value. To date, no method has been described for calculating this probability from measurements on a gate. Here we introduce a technique enabling quantitative benchmarking of quantum-logic gates against fault-tolerance thresholds for any architecture. We demonstrate our technique experimentally using a photonic entangling-gate. The relationship between experimental errors and their quantum logic effect is non-trivial: revealing this relationship requires a comprehensive theoretical model of the quantum-logic gate. We show the first such model for any architecture, and find multi-photon emission--a small effect previously regarded as secondary to mode-mismatch--to be the dominant source of logic error. We show that reducing this will move photonic quantum computing to within striking distance of fault-tolerance. 
0808.00795	A discrete element study of settlement in vibrated granular layers: role of contact loss and acceleration	Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)	Authors:Ali Karrech (LAMI), Denis Duhamel (LAMI), Guy Bonnet, François Chevoir (LAMI), Jean-Noel Roux (LAMI), Jean Canou (LAMI), Jean-Claude Dupla (LAMI)    	Abstract:  This paper deals with the vibration of granular materials due to cyclic external excitation. It highlights the effect of the acceleration on the settlement speed and proves the existence of a relationship between settlement and loss of contacts in partially confined granular materials under vibration. The numerical simulations are carried out using the Molecular Dynamics method, where the discrete elements consist of polygonal grains. The data analyses are conducted based on multivariate autoregressive models to describe the settlement and permanent contacts number with respect to the number of loading cycles. 
0808.00796	Experimental and theoretical studies of sequence effects on the fluctuation and melting of short DNA molecules	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Michel Peyrard (Phys-ENS), Santiago Cuesta-Lopez (Phys-ENS), Dimitar Angelov (Phys-ENS)    	Abstract:  Understanding the melting of short DNA sequences probes DNA at the scale of the genetic code and raises questions which are very different from those posed by very long sequences, which have been extensively studied. We investigate this problem by combining experiments and theory. A new experimental method allows us to make a mapping of the opening of the guanines along the sequence as a function of temperature. The results indicate that non-local effects may be important in DNA because an AT-rich region is able to influence the opening of a base pair which is about 10 base pairs away. An earlier mesoscopic model of DNA is modified to correctly describe the time scales associated to the opening of individual base pairs well below melting, and to properly take into account the sequence. Using this model to analyze some characteristic sequences for which detailed experimental data on the melting is available [Montrichok et al. 2003 Europhys. Lett. {\bf 62} 452], we show that we have to introduce non-local effects of AT-rich regions to get acceptable results. This brings a second indication that the influence of these highly fluctuating regions of DNA on their neighborhood can extend to some distance. 
0808.00797	Measurements of ttbar production cross-section with D0 experiment	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:V. Shary, for the D0 Collaboration	Abstract:  The recent measurements of the top anti-top quark pair production cross-section in proton antiproton collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV in lepton + jets and dilepton (including tau lepton) channels are presented. These measurements are based on 1 fb^{-1} of data collected with the DO experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. The measured values are compatible with the standard model prediction and have the uncertainty close to the uncertainty of the theoretical prediction ~10%.

The backscattered ultrasound frequency in the case of a vocal humming resonating in the chest wall is computed: the overall effect is that the signal/noise ratio could be easily improved at no cost. Clinical results are to appear separately elsewhere. 
0808.00799	Modelling DNA at the mesoscale: a challenge for nonlinear science?	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Michel Peyrard (Phys-ENS), Santiago Cuesta-Lopez (Phys-ENS), Guillaume James	Abstract:  When it is viewed at the scale of a base pair, DNA appears as a nonlinear lattice. Modelling its properties is a fascinating goal. The detailed experiments that can be performed on this system impose constraints on the models and can be used as a guide to improve them. There are nevertheless many open problems, particularly to describe DNA at the scale of a few tens of base pairs, which is relevant for many biological phenomena. 
0808.00800	Sub-barrier fusion excitation for the system $^7$Li+$^{28}$Si	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:Mandira Sinha, H. Majumdar, P. Basu, Subinit Roy, R. Bhattacharya, M. Biswas, M. K. Pradhan, S. Kailas	Abstract:  The sub-barrier fusion excitation functions are measured for the first time for the system $^7$Li +$^{28}$Si by the characteristic $γ$-ray method in the energy range $E_{lab}$= 7-11.5 MeV. The results show an enhancement, below the barrier, by about a factor of two when compared with the one-dimensional barrier penetration (1D BPM) model. Introduction of coupling with the rotational 2$^{+}$ state (1.779MeV) of the target improves the fit somewhat, but still an enhancement of about 25-40% remains.

0808.00802	Identification of Nodal Kink in Electron-Doped (Nd$_{1.85}$Ce$_{0.15}$)CuO$_4$ Superconductor from Laser-Based Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Haiyun Liu, Guodong Liu, Wentao Zhang, Lin Zhao, Jianqiao Meng, Xiaowen Jia, Xiaoli Dong, Wei Lu, Guiling Wang, Yong Zhou, Yong Zhu, Xiaoyang Wang, Tao Wu, Xianhui Chen, T. Sasagawa, Zuyan Xu, Chuangtian Chen, X. J. Zhou	Abstract:  High-resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission measurements have been carried out on the electron-doped (Nd$_{1.85}$Ce$_{0.15}$)CuO$_4$ high temperature superconductor. We have revealed a clear kink at $\sim$60 meV in the dispersion along the (0,0)-($π$,$π$) nodal direction, accompanied by a peak-dip-hump feature in the photoemission spectra. This indicates that the nodal electrons are coupled to collective excitations (bosons) in electron-doped superconductors, with the phonons as the most likely candidate of the boson. This finding has established a universality of nodal electron coupling in both hole- and electron-doped high temperature cuprate superconductors. 
0808.00803	On the Question of Temperature Transformations under Lorentz and Galilei Boosts	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Geoffrey L. Sewell	Abstract:  We provide a quantum statistical thermodynamical solution of the long standing problem of temperature transformations of uniformly moving bodies. Our treatment of this question is based on the well established quantum statistical result that the thermal equilibrium conditions demanded by both the Zeroth and Second Laws of Thermodynamics are precisely those of Kubo, Martin and Schwinger (KMS). We prove that, in both the special relativistic and nonrelativistic settings, a state of a body cannot satisfy these conditions for different inertial frames with non-zero relative velocity. Hence a body that serves as a thermal reservoir, in the sense of the Zeroth Law, in an inertial rest frame cannot do so in a laboratory frame relative to which it moves with non-zero uniform velocity. Consequently, there is no law of temperature transformation under either Lorentz or Galilei boosts, and so the concept of temperature stemming from the Zeroth Law is restricted to states of bodies in their rest frames. 
0808.00804	Granularity and vortex dynamics in LaO_0.92F_0.08FeAs as probed by harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Maria G. Adesso, Danilo Zola, Jianlin Luo, G F. Chen, Zhend Li, N. L. Wang, Sandro Pace, Canio Noce, Massimiliano Polichetti	Abstract:  Fundamental and higher harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility have been measured on a LaO_0.92F_0.08FeAs sample as a function of the temperature, at various amplitudes and frequencies of the AC magnetic field, with a small superimposed DC field parallel to the AC field. The granularity of the sample has been investigated and the inter-grain and intra-grain contributions have been clearly individuated looking at both the first and third harmonics. The vortex dynamics has been also analyzed, and a comparison with the magnetic behavior of both the MgB_2 and the cuprate superconductors has been performed. Some vortex dissipative phenomena, i.e. the thermally activated flux flow and the flux creep, have been detected in the presented measurements, similar to what obtained on YBCO. Nevertheless, although the general behavior is similar, several differences have been also evidenced between these different classes of superconductors, mainly in the third harmonics. We infer that different vortex dynamics have to be included into the analysis of the magnetic response in this iron-based new material. 
0808.00805	Evidence for Two Gaps and Breakdown of the Uemura Plot in Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ Single Crystals	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Cong Ren, Zhao-sheng Wang, Hui-qian Luo, Huan Yang, Lei Shan, Hai-Hu Wen	Abstract:  We report a detailed investigation on the lower critical field $H_{c1}$ of the superconducting Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ (FeAs-122) single crystals. A pronounced kink is observed on the $H_{c1}(T)$ curve, which is attributed to the existence of two superconducting gaps. By fitting the data $H_{c1}(T)$ to the two-gap BCS model in full temperature region, a small gap of $Δ_a(0)=2.0\pm 0.3$ meV and a large gap of $Δ_b(0)=8.9\pm 0.4$ meV are obtained. The in-plane penetration depth $λ_{ab}(0)$ is estimated to be 105 nm corresponding to a rather large superfluid density, which points to the breakdown of the Uemura plot in FeAs-122 superconductors. 
0808.00806	Monotonic d-wave Superconducting Gap in Optimally-Doped Bi$_2$Sr$_{1.6}$La$_{0.4}$CuO$_6$ Superconductor by Laser-Based Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Jianqiao Meng, Wentao Zhang, Guodong Liu, Lin Zhao, Haiyun Liu, Xiaowen Jia, Wei Lu, Xiaoli Dong, Guiling Wang, Hongbo Zhang, Yong Zhou, Yong Zhu, Xiaoyang Wang, Zhongxian Zhao, Zuyan Xu, Chuangtian Chen, X. J. Zhou	Abstract:  The momentum and temperature dependence of the superconducting gap and pseudogap in optimally-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_{1.6}$La$_{0.4}$CuO$_6$ superconductor is investigated by super-high resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The measured energy gap in the superconducting state exhibits a standard {\it d}-wave form. Pseudogap opens above T$_c$ over a large portion of the Fermi surface with a "Fermi arc" formed near the nodal region. In the region outside of the "Fermi arc", the pseudogap has the similar magnitude and momentum dependence as the gap in the superconducting state which changes little with temperature and shows no abrupt change across T$_c$. These observations indicate that the pseudogap and superconducting gap are closely related and favor the picture that the pseudogap is a precursor to the superconducting gap. 
0808.00807	Low-energy spectral features of supernova (anti)neutrinos in inverted hierarchy	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:G.L. Fogli, E. Lisi, A. Marrone, A. Mirizzi, I. Tamborra (U. of Bari & INFN, Bari & MPI, Munich)    	Abstract:  In the dense supernova core, self-interactions may align the flavor polarization vectors of neutrinos and antineutrinos, and induce collective flavor transformations. Different alignment ansatzes are known to describe approximately the phenomena of synchronized or bipolar oscillations, and the split of neutrino energy spectra. We discuss another phenomenon observed in some numerical experiments in inverted hierarchy, showing features akin to a low-energy split of antineutrino spectra. The phenomenon appears to be approximately described by another alignment ansatz which, in the considered scenario, reduces the (nonadiabatic) dynamics of all energy modes to only two neutrino plus two antineutrino modes. The associated spectral features, however, appear to be fragile when passing from single- to multi-angle simulations. 
0808.00808	Jet Modification in Heavy Ion Collisions at RHIC	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:M. van Leeuwen	Abstract:  These proceedings present a brief overview of the main results on jet-modifications in heavy ion collisions at RHIC. In heavy ion collisions, jets are studied using single hadron spectra and di-hadron correlations with a high-\pt{} trigger hadrons. At high pt, a suppression of the yields due to parton energy loss is observed. A quantitative confrontation of the data with various theoretical approaches to energy loss in a dense QCD medium is being pursued. First results from $γ$-jet events, where the photon balances the initial jet energy, are also presented and compared to expectations from models based on di-hadron measurements. At intermediate pt, two striking modifications of the di-hadron correlation structure are found in heavy ion collisions: the presence of a long-range {\it ridge} structure in \deta{}, and a large broadening of the recoil jet. Both phenomena seem to indicate an interplay between hard and soft physics. 
0808.00809	Evolution and nucleosynthesis in low mass Asymptotic Giant Branch stars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Cristallo	Abstract:  People usually smile when astrophysicists assert that we are sons of the stars, but human life confirms this sentence: about 65% of the mass of our body is made up of oxygen, carbon occurs in all organic life and is the basis of organic chemistry, nitrogen is an essential part of amino acids and nucleic acids, calcium is a major component of our bones. Moreover, phosphorus plays a major role in biological molecules such as DNA and RNA (where the chemical codes of life is written) and our blood carries oxygen to tissues by means of the hemoglobin (an iron pigment of red blood cells). All these elements have been created in stars. I just list some examples related to human body, but also common element such as aluminum, nickel, gold, silver and lead come from a pristine generation of stars. The abundances in the Solar System are in fact due to the mixing of material ejected from stars that polluted the Universe in different epochs before the Sun formation, occurred about 5 billion years ago, after the gravitational contraction of the proto-solar cloud. Low mass AGB stars (1<M/Msun<3) are among the most important polluters of the Milky Way, because of the strong winds eroding their chemically enriched envelopes. They are responsible for the nucleosynthesis of the main component of the cosmic s-elements. 
0808.00810	Hyperboloidal evolution with the Einstein equations	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Anil Zenginoglu	Abstract:  We consider an approach to the hyperboloidal evolution problem based on the Einstein equations written for a rescaled metric. It is shown that a conformal scale factor can be freely prescribed a priori in terms of coordinates in a well-posed hyperboloidal initial value problem such that the location of null infinity is independent of the time coordinate. With an appropriate choice of a single gauge source function each of the formally singular conformal source terms in the equations attains a regular limit at null infinity. The suggested approach could be beneficial in numerical relativity for both wave extraction and outer boundary treatment. 
0808.00811	Supersymmetry Breaks when Gauge Symmetry Breaks: Cybersusy I	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:John Dixon	Abstract:  This paper summarizes a new approach to supersymmetry breaking in the supersymmetric standard model (SSM). The approach arises from some remarkable features of the BRS cohomology for composite operators in the SSM, and the behaviour of those operators when gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken. A new realization of supersymmetry arises for these operators. This realization is equivalent to the generation of supersymmetry anomalies, though they are not present in the usual sense. The consequences are worked out in detail for the electron and neutrino flavour triplets, by using the appropriate effective action to analyze the new anomalous realization of supersymmetry. This effective action generates a mass spectrum for leptons that is consistent with present experimental data. There is no vacuum energy problem, and no annoying mass sum rules are present. 
0808.00812	Theory of the Neutrino Mass	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Ferruccio Feruglio, Claudia Hagedorn, Yin Lin, Luca Merlo	Abstract:  Theoretical aspects of neutrino physics are reviewed, with emphasis on possible explanations of the smallness of neutrino masses and of the peculiar mixing pattern observed in the lepton sector. Some theoretically motivated frameworks, such as those based on spontaneously broken discrete flavour symmetries, are discussed, stressing the importance of low-energy observables, like anomalous magnetic moments, electric dipole moments and lepton flavour violating transitions, to test further features of these models. 
0808.00813	RoboNet-II: Follow-up observations of microlensing events with a robotic network of telescopes	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Y. Tsapras, R. Street, K. Horne, C. Snodgrass, M. Dominik, A. Allan, I. Steele, D.M. Bramich, E.S. Saunders, N. Rattenbury, C. Mottram, S. Fraser, N. Clay, M. Burgdorf, M. Bode, T. A. Lister, E. Hawkins, J. P. Beaulieu, P. Fouque, M. Albrow, J. Menzies, A. Cassan, D. Dominis-Prester	Abstract:  RoboNet-II uses a global network of robotic telescopes to perform follow-up observations of microlensing events in the Galactic Bulge. The current network consists of three 2m telescopes located in Hawaii and Australia (owned by Las Cumbres Observatory) and the Canary Islands (owned by Liverpool John Moores University). In future years the network will be expanded by deploying clusters of 1m telescopes in other suitable locations. A principal scientific aim of the RoboNet-II project is the detection of cool extra-solar planets by the method of gravitational microlensing. These detections will provide crucial constraints to models of planetary formation and orbital migration. RoboNet-II acts in coordination with the PLANET microlensing follow-up network and uses an optimization algorithm ("web-PLOP") to select the targets and a distributed scheduling paradigm (eSTAR) to execute the observations. Continuous automated assessment of the observations and anomaly detection is provided by the ARTEMiS system.

Wong	Abstract:  We derive cosmological limits on two-component hot dark matter consisting of neutrinos and axions. We restrict the large-scale structure data to the safely linear regime, excluding the Lyman-alpha forest. We derive Bayesian credible regions in the two-parameter space consisting of m_a and sum(m_nu). Marginalizing over sum(m_nu) provides m_a<1.02 eV (95% CL). In the absence of axions the same data and methods give sum(m_nu)< 0.63 eV (95% CL). 
0808.00815	Quantum response to time-dependent external fields	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Seiji Miyashita, Shu Tanaka, Hans De Raedt, Bernard Barbara	Abstract:  Recently, explicit real time dynamics has been studied in various systems. These quantum mechanical dynamics could provide new recipes in information processing. We study quantum dynamics under time dependent external fields, and explore how to control the quantum state, and also how to bring the state into a target state. Here, we investigate a pure quantum mechanical dynamics, dynamics in quantum Monte Carlo simulation and also in quantum master equation. For the control magnetic states, operators which do not commute with magnetization are important. We study case of the transverse Ising model, in which we compare natures of thermal and quantum fluctuations. We also study the cases of the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction, where we find a peculiar energy level structure. Moreover we study the case of itinerant magnetic state, where we study the change from the Mott insulator to the Nagaoka ferromagnetic state. Effects of dissipation are also discussed. 
0808.00816	Persistent random walk on a one-dimensional lattice with random asymmetric transmittances	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Zeinab Sadjadi, MirFaez Miri	Abstract:  We study the persistent random walk of photons on a one-dimensional lattice of random asymmetric transmittances. Each site is characterized by its intensity transmittance t (t') for photons moving to the right (left) direction. Transmittances at different sites are assumed independent, distributed according to a given probability density Distribution. We use the effective medium approximation and identify two classes of probability density distribution of transmittances which lead to the normal diffusion of photons. Monte Carlo simulations confirm our predictions. 
0808.00817	Stochastic approach for a multivalued Dirichlet-Neumann problem	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Lucian Maticiuc, Aurel Rascanu	Abstract:  We prove the existence and uniqueness of a viscosity solution of the parabolic variational inequality with a nonlinear multivalued Neumann-Dirichlet boundary condition:% {equation*} \{{array}{r} \dfrac{\partial u(t,x)}{\partial t}-\mathcal{L}_{t}u(t,x) {+}{% \partial φ}\big(u(t,x)\big)\ni f\big(t,x,u(t,x),(\nabla uσ)(t,x)\big), t>0, x\in \mathcal{D},\medskip \multicolumn{1}{l}{\dfrac{\partial u(t,x)}{\partial n}+{\partial ψ}\big(% u(t,x)\big)\ni g\big(t,x,u(t,x)\big), t>0, x\in Bd(\mathcal{D}%),\multicolumn{1}{l}{u(0,x)=h(x), x\in \bar{\mathcal{D}},}% {array}%. {equation*}% where $\partial φ$ and $\partial ψ$ are subdifferentials operators and $\mathcal{L}_{t}$ is a second differential operator. The result is obtained by a Feynman-Kaç representation formula starting from the backward stochastic variational inequality:% {equation*} \{{array}{l} dY_{t}{+}F(t,Y_{t},Z_{t}) dt{+}G(t,Y_{t}) dA_{t}\in \partial φ (Y_{t}) dt{+}\partial ψ(Y_{t}) dA_{t}{+}Z_{t}dW_{t}, 0\leq t\leq T,\medskip \ Y_{T}=ξ.% {array}%. {equation*} 
0808.00818	Generalized Elliott-Yafet theory of electron spin relaxation in metals: the origin of the anomalous electron spin life-time in MgB2	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:F. Simon, B. Dora, F. Muranyi, A. Janossy, S. Garaj, L. Forro, S. Bud'ko, C. Petrovic, P. C. Canfield	Abstract:  The temperature dependence of the electron spin relaxation time in MgB2 is anomalous as it does not follow the temperature dependence of the resistivity above 150 K, it has a maximum around 400 K, and it decreases for higher temperatures. This violates the well established Elliot-Yafet theory of electron spin relaxation in metals. We show that the anomaly occurs when the quasi-particle scattering rate (in energy units) becomes comparable to the energy difference between the conduction- and a neighboring band. We find that the anomalous behavior is related to the unique band structure of MgB$_2$ and the large electron-phonon coupling. The saturating spin-lattice relaxation can be regarded as the spin transport analogue of the Ioffe-Regel criterion of electron transport. 
0808.00819	A Model Of Inflationary Cosmology Without Singularity	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yi-Fu Cai, Tao-tao Qiu, Jun-Qing Xia, Xinmin Zhang	Abstract:  In this letter, we propose a model of inflationary cosmology with a bounce preceded and study its primordial curvature perturbations. Our model gives rise to a primordial power spectrum with a feature of oscillation on large scales compared with the nearly scale-invariant spectrum generated by the traditional slow rolling inflation model. We will show this effect changes the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature power spectrum and the Large Scale Structure (LSS) matter power spectrum. And further with a detailed simulation we will point out this signal is detectable to the forthcoming observations, such as PLANCK and LAMOST. 
0808.00820	Pure emitter dephasing : a resource for advanced solid-state single photon sources	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Alexia Auffèves, Jean-Michel Gérard, Jean-Philippe Poizat	Abstract:  We have computed the spectrum emitted spontaneously by a quantum dot coupled to an arbitrarily detuned single mode cavity, taking into account pure dephasing processes. We show that if the emitter is incoherent, the cavity can efficiently emit photons with its own spectral characteristics. This effect opens unique opportunities for the development of devices exploiting both cavity quantum electrodynamics effects and pure dephasing, such as wavelength stabilized single photon sources robust against spectral diffusion. 
0808.00821	Micro-Brillouin Study of the Eigenvibrations of Single Isolated Polymer Nanospheres	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Y. Li, H. S. Lim, Z. K. Wang, S. C. Ng, M. H. Kuok	Abstract:  The localized acoustic modes of single isolated polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polystyrene nanospheres have been studied by micro-Brillouin light scattering. The measured mode frequencies are analyzed on the basis of the Lamb theory formulated for a sphere under free boundary conditions. By measuring light scattering from single isolated particles, placed atop a piece of polished silicon wafer, the free-surface conditions are almost experimentally realized. The observed spectral peaks are attributed to localized eigenvibrations whose frequencies scale as inverse sphere diameter, in accordance with Lamb's theory. The Young's moduli and Poisson ratios of the polymer spheres studied have been evaluated from fits to the experimental data. We have demonstrated that micro-Brillouin spectroscopy is a powerful technique for probing the acoustic dynamics and mechanical properties of nanostructures. 
0808.00822	Injection to the pick-up ion regime from high energies and induced ion power laws	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:H.-J. Fahr, I. V. Chashei, D. Verscharen	Abstract:  Though pick-up ions (PUIs) are a well known phenomenon in the inner heliosphere their phase-space distribution nevertheless is a theoretically unsettled problem. Especially the question of how pick-up ions form their suprathermal tails, extending to far above their injection energies, still now is unsatistactorily answered. Though Fermi-2 velocity diffusion theories have revealed that such tails are populated, they nevertheless show that resulting population densities are much less than seen in observations showing power-laws with a velocity index of "-5". We first investigate here, whether or not observationally suggested power-laws can be the result of a quasi-equilibrium state between suprathermal ions and magnetohydrodynamic turbulences in energy exchange with eachother. We demonstrate that such an equilibrium cannot be established, since it would require too high pick-up ion pressures enforcing a shock-free deceleration of the solar wind. We furthermore show that Fermi-2 type energy diffusion in the outer heliosphere is too inefficient to determine the shape of the distribution function there. As we can show, however, power-laws beyond the injection threshold can be established, if the injection takes place at higher energies of the order of 100 keV. As we demonstrate here, such an injection is connected with modulated anomalous cosmic ray (ACR) particles at the lower end of their spectrum when they again start being convected outwards with the solar wind. Therefore, we refer to these particles as ACR-PUIs. In our quantitative calculation of the pick-up ion spectrum resulting under such conditions we in fact find again power-laws, however with a velocity power index of "-4" and fairly distance-independent spectral intensities. 
0808.00823	Scalar radius of the pion in the Kroll-Lee-Zumino renormalizable theory	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:C.A. Dominguez, M. Loewe, B. Willers	Abstract:  The Kroll-Lee-Zumino renormalizable Abelian quantum field theory of pions and a massive rho-meson is used to calculate the scalar radius of the pion at next to leading (one loop) order in perturbation theory. Due to renormalizability, this determination involves no free parameters. The result is $<r^2_π>_s = 0.40 {fm}^2$. This value gives for $\bar{\ell}_4$, the low energy constant of chiral perturbation theory, $\bar{\ell}_4 = 3.4$, and $F_π/F = 1.05$, where F is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit. Given the level of accuracy in the masses and the $ρππ$ coupling, the only sizable uncertainty in this result is due to the (uncalculated) NNLO contribution. 
0808.00824	On the Capability Of Super-Kamiokande Detector To Define the Primary Parameters Of Muon And Electron Events	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:V.I.Galkin (1), A.M.Anokhina (1), E.Konishi (2), A.Misaki (3) ((1) Department of Physics, Moscow State University, Russia,(2) Graduate School of Science and Technology, Hirosaki University, Japan,(3) Research Institute for Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Japan)    	Abstract:  We develop a new discrimination procedure for separating electron neutrinos from muon neutrinos, based on detailed simulations carried out with GEANT3.21 and with mean angular distribution functions and their relative fluctuations. Using our procedure we are able to discriminate muons from electrons in Fully Contained Events in Super-Kamioknade Experiment with a probability of error ofless than several %. Also we have checked geometrical resolution on both cases, considering only the ring-like structure of the Cherenkov image and a geometrical reconstruction procedure utilizing the full distribution. Even the methodologically correct approach we have adopted, we cannot reproduce the accuracies for particle discrimination, momentum resolution, interaction vertex location, and angular resolution obtained by the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration. 
0808.00825	ThermoElectric Transport Properties of a Chain of Quantum Dots with Self-Consistent Reservoirs	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Philippe A. Jacquet	Abstract:  We introduce a model for charge and heat transport based on the Landauer-Buttiker scattering approach. The system consists of a chain of $N$ quantum dots, each of them being coupled to a particle reservoir. Additionally, the left and right ends of the chain are coupled to two particle reservoirs. All these reservoirs are independent and can be described by any of the standard physical distributions: Maxwell-Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein. In the linear response regime, and under some assumptions, we first describe the general transport properties of the system. Then we impose the self-consistency condition, i.e. we fix the boundary values (T_L,μ_L) and (T_R,mu_R), and adjust the parameters (T_i,mu_i), for i = 1,...,N, so that the net average electric and heat currents into all the intermediate reservoirs vanish. This condition leads to expressions for the temperature and chemical potential profiles along the system, which turn out to be independent of the distribution describing the reservoirs. We also determine the average electric and heat currents flowing through the system and present some numerical results, using random matrix theory, showing that these currents are typically governed by Ohm and Fourier laws. 
0808.00826	Aspects of quintessence matter - the driver of the late time acceleration of the universe	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Sudipta Das	Abstract:  The present thesis is a collection of papers which deals with analytic models that can drive the present accelerated expansion of the universe, starting from a decelerated expansion in the early matter dominated regime. Both minimally and non minimally coupled scalar fields are employed for the purpose. Interaction between nonminimally coupled scalar field, such as the Brans-Dicke field, with dark matter and dark energy are considered. This interactions are shown to solve some fine tuning problems. Curvature driven acceleration is also considered in this thesis, which shows that a smooth transition from a deceleration to an acceleration is possible in this scenario. 
0808.00827	A direct measurement of the Bose-Einstein Condensation universality class in NiCl$_2$-4SC(NH$_2$)$_2$ at ultra-low temperatures	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:L. Yin, J.S. Xia, V.S. Zapf, N.S. Sullivan, A. Paduan-Filho	Abstract:  In this work, we demonstrate field-induced Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in the organic compound NiCl$_2$-4SC(NH$_2$)$_2$ using AC susceptibility measurements down to 1 mK. The Ni $\textsl{S}$=1 spins exhibit 3D $\mathit{XY}$ antiferromagnetism between a lower critical field $H_{c1} \sim$ 2 T and a upper critical field $H_{c2} \sim$ 12 T. The results show a power-law temperature dependence of the phase transition line $H_{c1} (T) -H_{c1} (0) = aT^α$ with $α=$ 1.47$\pm$0.10 and $H_{c1} (0) = 2.053$ T, consistent with the 3D Bose-Einstein Condensation universality class. An abnormal change was found in the phase boundary near $H_{c2}$ at approximately 150 mK. 
0808.00828	Electrocardiogram of the Mixmaster Universe	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Donato Bini, Christian Cherubini, Andrea Geralico, Robert T. Jantzen	Abstract:  The Mixmaster dynamics is revisited in a new light as revealing a series of transitions in the complex scale invariant scalar invariant of the Weyl curvature tensor best represented by the speciality index $\mathcal{S}$, which gives a 4-dimensional measure of the evolution of the spacetime independent of all the 3-dimensional gauge-dependent variables except for the time used to parametrize it. Its graph versus time characterized by correlated isolated pulses in its real and imaginary parts corresponding to curvature wall collisions serves as a sort of electrocardiogram of the Mixmaster universe, with each such pulse pair arising from a single circuit or ``complex pulse'' around the origin in the complex plane. These pulses in the speciality index and their limiting points on the real axis seem to invariantly characterize some of the so called spike solutions in inhomogeneous cosmology and should play an important role as a gauge invariant lens through which to view current investigations of inhomogeneous Mixmaster dynamics. 
0808.00829	A note on the primordial abundance of stau NLSPs	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Michael Ratz, Kai Schmidt-Hoberg, Martin Wolfgang Winkler	Abstract:  In scenarios with a gravitino LSP, there exist strong BBN constraints on the abundance of a possible stau NLSP. We find that in settings with substantial left-right mixing of the stau mass eigenstates these constraints can be evaded even for very long-lived staus. 
0808.00830	Local prediction of turning points of oscillating time series	Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)	Authors:D. Kugiumtzis	Abstract:  For oscillating time series, the prediction is often focused on the turning points. In order to predict the turning point magnitudes and times it is proposed to form the state space reconstruction only from the turning points and modify the local (nearest neighbor) model accordingly. The model on turning points gives optimal prediction at a lower dimensional state space than the optimal local model applied directly on the oscillating time series and is thus computationally more efficient. Monte Carlo simulations on different oscillating nonlinear systems showed that it gives better predictions of turning points and this is confirmed also for the time series of annual sunspots and total stress in a plastic deformation experiment. 
0808.00831	The Mixmaster Universe in a generalized uncertainty principle framework	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Marco Valerio Battisti, Giovanni Montani	Abstract:  The Bianchi IX cosmological model is analyzed in a generalized uncertainty principle framework. The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner reduction of the dynamics is performed and a time-coordinate, namely the volume of the Universe, naturally arises. Such a variable is treated in the ordinary way while the anisotropies (the physical degrees of freedom) are described by a deformed Heisenberg algebra. The analysis of the model (passing through Bianchi I and II) is performed at classical level by studying the modifications induced on the symplectic geometry by the deformed algebra. We show that, the Universe can not isotropize because of the deformed Kasner dynamics, the triangular allowed domain is asymptotically stationary with respect to the particle (Universe) and its bounces against the walls are not interrupted by the deformed effects. Furthermore, no reflection law can be in general obtained since the Bianchi II model is no longer analytically integrable. This way, the deformed Mixmaster Universe can be still considered a chaotic system. 
0808.00832	Iterated Riesz Commutators: A Simple Proof of Boundedness	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Michael T. Lacey, Stefanie Petermichl, Jill C. Pipher, Brett D. Wick	Abstract:  We give a simple proof of L^p boundedness of iterated commutators of Riesz transforms and a product BMO function. We use a representation of the Riesz transforms by means of simple dyadic operators - dyadic shifts - which in turn reduces the estimate quickly to paraproduct estimates. 
0808.00833	Inclusive diffraction with the ZEUS detector at HERA: a comparison among selection methods	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Marta Ruspa (on behalf of the ZEUS Collaboration)    	Abstract:  The diffractive dissociation of virtual photons, gamma*p -> Xp, has been studied with the ZEUS detector at HERA by requiring a large rapidity gap between X and the outgoing proton, by analysing the mass distribution, M_X, of the hadronic final state, as well as by directly tagging the proton. At low values of the proton momentum loss, the diffractive structure function measurements obtained with the three methods are consistent, provided the different treatment and contributions of proton-dissociative events are taken into account. 
0808.00834	Proximity of LaOFeAs to a magnetic instability	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:I. Opahle, H. C. Kandpal, Y. Zhang, C. Gros, R. Valenti	Abstract:  We investigate the effect of external pressure on the Fe magnetic moment in undoped LaOFeAs within the framework of density functional theory and show that this system is close to a magnetic instability: The Fe moment is found to drop by nearly a factor of 3 within a pressure range of $\pm$ 5 GPa around the calculated equilibrium volume. While the Fe moments show an unusually strong sensitivity to the spin arrangement (type of anti-ferromagnetic structure), the low temperature structural distortion is found to have only a minor influence on them. Analysis of the Fermi surface topology and nesting features shows that these properties change very little up to pressures of at least 10 GPa. We discuss the magnetic instability in terms of the itinerancy of this system. 
0808.00835	Perron-Frobenius operators and representations of the Cuntz-Krieger algebras for infinite matrices	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Daniel Goncalves, Danilo Royer	Abstract:  In this paper we extend work of Kawamura, see kawamura, for Cuntz-Krieger algebras O_A for infinite matrices A. We generalize the definition of branching systems, prove their existence for any given matrix A and show how they induce some very concrete representations of O_A. We use these representations to describe the Perron-Frobenius operator, associated to an nonsingular transformation, as an infinite sum and under some hypothesis we find a matrix representation for the operator. We finish the paper with a few examples. 
0808.00836	The Optical Alignment System of the ZEUS MicroVertex Detector	Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)	Authors:K. Korcsak-Gorzo, G. Grzelak, K. Oliver, M. Dawson, R. Devenish, J. Ferrando, T. Matsushita, P. Shield, R. Walczak	Abstract:  The laser alignment system of the ZEUS microvertex detector is described. The detector was installed in 2001 as part of an upgrade programme in preparation for the second phase of electron-proton physics at the HERA collider. The alignment system monitors the position of the vertex detector support structure with respect to the central tracking detector using semi-transparent amorphous-silicon sensors and diode lasers. The system is fully integrated into the general environmental monitoring of the ZEUS detector and data has been collected over a period of 5 years. The primary aim of defining periods of stability for track-based alignment has been achieved and the system is able to measure movements of the support structure to a precision around $10 μ$m. 
0808.00837	On the Integrability of the Discrete Nonlinear Schroedinger Equation	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Decio Levi, Matteo Petrera, Christian Scimiterna	Abstract:  In this letter we present an analytic evidence of the non-integrability of the discrete nonlinear Schroedinger equation, a well-known discrete evolution equation which has been obtained in various contexts of physics and biology. We use a reductive perturbation technique to show an obstruction to its integrability. 
0808.00838	Lattice Dynamics of LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} and PrFeAsO_{1-y} via Inelastic X-Ray Scattering and First-Principles Calculation	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:T. Fukuda, A. Q. R. Baron, S. Shamoto, M. Ishikado, H. Nakamura, M. Machida, H. Uchiyama, S. Tsutsui, A. Iyo, H. Kito, J. Mizuki, M. Arai, H. Eisaki, H. Hosono	Abstract:  The lattice dynamics of LaFeAsO_{1-x}F_{x} (x=0, 0.1) and PrFeAsO_{1-y} (y~0.1) are investigated using inelastic x-ray scattering and ab-initio calculation. Measurements of powder samples provide an approximation to the phonon DOS, while dispersion is measured from a single crystal of PrFeAsO_{1-y}. A model that agrees reasonably well with all of the data at room temperature is built from results of ab-initio calculations by softening the strength of the Fe-As bond by 30%. 
0808.00839	Phantom stars and topology change	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Andrew DeBenedictis, Remo Garattini, Francisco S. N. Lobo	Abstract:  In this work, we consider time-dependent dark energy star models, with an evolving parameter $ω$ crossing the phantom divide, $ω=-1$. Once in the phantom regime, the null energy condition is violated, which physically implies that the negative radial pressure exceeds the energy density. Therefore, an enormous negative pressure in the center may, in principle, imply a topology change, consequently opening up a tunnel and converting the dark energy star into a wormhole. The criteria for this topology change are discussed, in particular, we consider the Morse Index analysis and a Casimir energy approach involving quasi-local energy difference calculations that may reflect or measure the occurrence of a topology change. We denote these exotic geometries consisting of dark energy stars (in the phantom regime) and phantom wormholes as phantom stars. The final product of this topological change, namely, phantom wormholes, have far-reaching physical and cosmological implications, as in addition to being used for interstellar shortcuts, an absurdly advanced civilization may manipulate these geometries to induce closed timelike curves, consequently violating causality. 
0808.00840	Resolving Gravitational Singularities	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Finn Larsen	Abstract:  We review recent progress on the resolution of gravitational singularities in string theory. The main example is the fundamental string in five dimensions which is singular in the standard supergravity description but regular after taking into account higher derivative corrections determined by anomalies and supersymmetry. The application of the AdS/CFT correspondence to geometries that require higher derivatives for regularity poses interesting challenges. 
0808.00841	Surface Magnetoelectric Effect in Ferromagnetic Metal Films	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Chun-Gang Duan, Julian P. Velev, R. F. Sabirianov, Ziqiang Zhu, Junhao Chu, S. S. Jaswal, E. Y. Tsymbal	Abstract:  A surface magnetoelectric effect is revealed by density-functional calculations that are applied to ferromagnetic Fe(001), Ni(001) and Co(0001) films in the presence of external electric field. The effect originates from spin-dependent screening of the electric field which leads to notable changes in the surface magnetization and the surface magnetocrystalline anisotropy. These results are of considerable interest in the area of electrically-controlled magnetism and magnetoelectric phenomena. 
0808.00842	Anomalous WWH couplings in gamma gamma collision with initial beams and final state polarizations	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:B. Sahin	Abstract:  The constraints on anomalous Higgs boson couplings are investigated through the process $γγ\to W^{+}W^{-}H$. Considering the longitudinal and transverse polarization states of the final $W^{+}$ and $W^{-}$ bosons and incoming beam polarizations, we find 95% confidence level limits on the anomalous coupling parameters $Δa_{W}$, $b_{W}$ and $β_{W}$ with an integrated luminosity of 500 $fb^{-1}$ and $\sqrt{s}$=0.5, 1 TeV energies. We show that initial beam and final state polarizations lead to a significant improvement on the sensitivity limits of the anomalous coupling parameters $b_{W}$ and $β_{W}$. 
0808.00843	Chemical mixing in smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Thomas H. Greif, Simon C. O. Glover, Volker Bromm, Ralf S. Klessen	Abstract:  We introduce a simple and efficient algorithm for diffusion in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations and apply it to the problem of chemical mixing. Based on the concept of turbulent diffusion, we link the diffusivity of a pollutant to the local physical conditions and can thus resolve mixing in space and time. We apply our prescription to the evolution of an idealized supernova remnant and find that we can model the distribution of heavy elements without having to explicitly resolve hydrodynamic instabilities in the post-shock gas. Instead, the dispersal of the pollutant is implicitly modelled through its dependence on the local velocity dispersion. Our method can thus be used in any SPH simulation that investigates chemical mixing but lacks the necessary resolution on small scales. Potential applications include the enrichment of the interstellar medium in present-day galaxies, as well as the intergalactic medium at high redshifts. 
0808.00844	A Novel Proof of the Heine-Borel Theorem	History and Overview (math.HO)	Authors:Matthew Macauley, Brian Rabern, Landon Rabern	Abstract:  Every beginning real analysis student learns the classic Heine-Borel theorem, that the interval [0,1] is compact. In this article, we present a proof of this result that doesn't involve the standard techniques such as constructing a sequence and appealing to the completeness of the reals. We put a metric on the space of infinite binary sequences and prove that compactness of this space follows from a simple combinatorial lemma. The Heine-Borel theorem is an immediate corollary. 
0808.00845	Mutual information is copula entropy	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Jian Ma, Zengqi Sun	Abstract:  We prove that mutual information is actually negative copula entropy, based on which a method for mutual information estimation is proposed. 
0808.00846	The Multiplicity of Main Sequence Turnoffs in Globular Clusters	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. V. Ryabova, Yu. A. Shchekinov	Abstract:  We present color-magnitude diagrams of globular clusters for models with self-enrichment and pre-enrichment. The models with self-enrichment turn out to have two or more main sequence turnoff points in the color-magnitude diagram if the fraction of mass lost by the globular cluster under supernova explosions does not exceed 95-97%. The models with pre-enrichment can have only one main sequence turnoff point. We argue that the cluster wCen evolved according to a self-enrichment scenario. 
0808.00847	An approach to fast fits of the unintegrated gluon density	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:A. Knutsson, A. Bacchetta, H. Jung, K. Kutak	Abstract:  An approach to fast fits of the unintegrated gluon density has been developed and used to determine the unintegrated gluon density by fits to deep inelastic scatting di-jet data from HERA. The fitting method is based on the determination of the parameter dependence by help of interpolating between grid points in the parameter-observable space before the actual fit is performed. 
0808.00848	Gauge Mediation with Sequestered Supersymmetry Breaking	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Satoshi Shirai, Fuminobu Takahashi, T.T. Yanagida, Kazuya Yonekura	Abstract:  Gauge mediation models have two drawbacks, that is, the so-called μ-problem and a lack of predictability of the gravitino dark matter abundance. We show that conformal sequestering in the supersymmetry breaking sector offers attractive solutions to both problems. The correct mass scale of the μand B_μterms is generated by taking the gravitino mass of O(100) GeV without causing the flavor-changing neutral-current problem. Moreover, a large anomalous dimension of the supersymmetry breaking field naturally realizes the small stau and neutralino mass difference required for the coannihilation to work yielding the right dark matter abundance. 
0808.00849	Interacting resonant level coupled to a Luttinger liquid: Universality of thermodynamic properties	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Moshe Goldstein, Yuval Weiss, Richard Berkovits	Abstract:  We investigate a model of a single resonant level coupled to the edge of a quantum wire in the Luttinger liquid phase or to the middle of a chiral Luttinger liquid via both tunneling and a contact interaction. Utilizing the Yuval-Anderson approach, we map this model onto a classical 1D Coulomb gas in which all the details of both the interactions in the lead and the level-lead interaction enter only through the corresponding Fermi-edge singularity exponent, which we explicitly evaluate using the Bethe ansatz solution for a particular model of the lead. Thus the population, dynamical capacitance and level entropy are universal in the sense of being equal for models with interactions differing in magnitude and even in sign. We demonstrate this to hold quantitatively using density matrix renormalization group calculations. Since the Coulomb gas description is of the single channel Kondo type, we infer that the universality we found implies that Luttinger liquid physics has no qualitative effect on these properties, in contrast with perturbative results. 
0808.00850	Resonance effects due to the excitation of surface Josephson plasma waves in layered superconductors	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:V.A. Yampol'skii, A.V. Kats, M.L. Nesterov, A.Yu. Nikitin, T.M. Slipchenko, S.E. Savel'ev, Franco Nori	Abstract:  We analytically examine the excitation of surface Josephson plasma waves (SJPWs) in periodically-modulated layered superconductors. We show that the absorption of the incident electromagnetic wave can be substantially increased, for certain incident angles, due to the resonance excitation of SJPWs. The absorption increase is accompanied by the decrease of the specular reflection. Moreover, we find the physical conditions guaranteeing the total absorption (and total suppression of the specular reflection). These conditions can be realized for Bi2212 superconductor films. 
0808.00851	Proof of the Caratheodory Conjecture	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Brendan Guilfoyle, Wilhelm Klingenberg	Abstract:  A well-known conjecture of Caratheodory states that the number of umbilic points on a closed convex surface in ${\mathbb E}^3$ must be greater than one. In this paper we prove this for $C^{3+α}$-smooth surfaces. The Conjecture is first reformulated in terms of complex points on a Lagrangian surface in $TS^2$, viewed as the space of oriented geodesics in ${\mathbb E}^3$. Here complex and Lagrangian refer to the canonical neutral Kaehler structure on $TS^2$. We then prove that the existence of a closed convex surface with only one umbilic point implies the existence of a totally real Lagrangian hemisphere in $TS^2$, to which it is not possible to attach the edge of a holomorphic disc. The main step in the proof is to establish the existence of a holomorphic disc with edge contained on any given totally real Lagrangian hemisphere. To construct the holomorphic disc we utilize mean curvature flow with respect to the neutral metric. Long-time existence of this flow is proven by a priori estimates and we show that the flowing disc is asymptotically holomorphic. Existence of a holomorphic disc is then deduced from Schauder estimates. 
0808.00852	Factorizations for 3-rotations and polarization of the light in Mueller-Stokes an Jones formalisms	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:V.M. Red'kov, N.G. Tokarevskaya	Abstract:  Formulas describing all 2-element and 3-element factorizations of arbitrary element of the groups SU(2) and SO(3,R) are derived. Six 2-element factorizations, $ (U_{2}U_{3}U'_{2}), (U_{3}U_{2}U'_{3}), (U_{3}U_{1}U'_{3}), (U_{1}U_{3}U'_{1}), (U_{1}U_{2}U'_{1}), (U_{2}U_{1}U'_{2})$, provide all possible way to define Euler type angles; and six 3-element ones, $ (U_{1}U_{2}U_{3}), (U_{1}U_{3}U'_{2}), (U_{2}U_{3}U_{1}), (U_{2}U_{1}U_{3}), (U_{3}U_{1}U_{2}), (U_{3}U_{2}U_{1})$ provide all possible ways to parameterize the unitary and orthogonal groups by three elementary angles. In thecontext the light polarization formalism of Stokes-Mueller vectors and Jones spinors, relations produced give a base to resolve arbitrary pure polarization rotators into all possible sets of elementary rotators of two or three constituents. 
0808.00853	Divergences Test Statistics for Discretely Observed Diffusion Processes	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Alessandro De Gregorio, Stefano Iacus	Abstract:  In this paper we propose the use of $φ$-divergences as test statistics to verify simple hypotheses about a one-dimensional parametric diffusion process $\de X_t = b(X_t, θ)\de t + σ(X_t, θ)\de W_t$, from discrete observations $\{X_{t_i}, i=0, ..., n\}$ with $t_i = iΔ_n$, $i=0, 1, >..., n$, under the asymptotic scheme $Δ_n\to0$, $nΔ_n\to\infty$ and $nΔ_n^2\to 0$. The class of $φ$-divergences is wide and includes several special members like Kullback-Leibler, Rényi, power and $α$-divergences. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics based on $φ$-divergences. The limiting law takes different forms depending on the regularity of $φ$. These convergence differ from the classical results for independent and identically distributed random variables. Numerical analysis is used to show the small sample properties of the test statistics in terms of estimated level and power of the test. 
0808.00854	Reduction of Almost Poisson brackets and Hamiltonization of the Chaplygin Sphere	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Luis C. Garcia-Naranjo	Abstract:  We construct different almost Poisson brackets for nonholonomic systems than those existing in the literature and study their reduction. Such brackets are built by considering non-canonical two-forms on the cotangent bundle of configuration space and then carrying out a projection onto the constraint space that encodes the Lagrange-D'Alembert principle. We justify the need for this type of brackets by working out the reduction of the celebrated Chaplygin sphere rolling problem. Our construction provides a geometric explanation of the Hamiltonization of the problem given by A. V. Borisov and I. S. Mamaev. 
0808.00855	Quantum interference and Klein tunneling in graphene heterojunctions	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Andrea F. Young, Philip Kim	Abstract:  The observation of quantum conductance oscillations in mesoscopic systems has traditionally required the confinement of the carriers to a phase space of reduced dimensionality. While electron optics such as lensing and focusing have been demonstrated experimentally, building a collimated electron interferometer in two unconfined dimensions has remained a challenge due to the difficulty of creating electrostatic barriers that are sharp on the order of the electron wavelength. Here, we report the observation of conductance oscillations in extremely narrow graphene heterostructures where a resonant cavity is formed between two electrostatically created bipolar junctions. Analysis of the oscillations confirms that p-n junctions have a collimating effect on ballistically transmitted carriers. The phase shift observed in the conductance fringes at low magnetic fields is a signature of the perfect transmission of carriers normally incident on the junctions and thus constitutes a direct experimental observation of ``Klein Tunneling.'' 
0808.00856	Chiral condensate in neutron matter	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:N. Kaiser, W. Weise	Abstract:  A recent chiral perturbation theory calculation of the in-medium quark condensate $<\bar q q>$ is extended to the isospin-asymmetric case of pure neutron matter. In contrast to the behavior in isospin-symmetric nuclear matter we find only small deviations from the linear density approximation. This feature originates primarily from the reduced weight factors (e.g. 1/6 for the dominant contributions) of the $2π$-exchange mechanisms in pure neutron matter. Our result suggests therefore that the tendencies for chiral symmetry restoration are actually favored in systems with large neutron excess (e.g. neutron stars). We also analyze the behavior of the density-dependent quark condensate $<\bar q q>(ρ_n)$ in the chiral limit $m_π\to 0$. 
0808.00857	A Chandra Look at Five of the Broadest Double-Peaked Balmer-Line Emitters	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Iskra V. Strateva (1), W. N. Brandt (2), Michael Eracleous (2), Gordon Garmire (2) ((1) MPE, Germany; (2) Penn State University, USA)    	Abstract:  We study the 0.5-10keV emission of a sample of five of the broadest double-peaked Balmer-line emitters with Chandra. The Balmer lines of these objects originate close (within a few hundred gravitational radii) to the central black holes of the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), and their double-peaked profiles suggest an origin in the AGN accretion disk. We find that four of the five targets can be modeled by simple power-law continua with photon indices (1.6-1.8) typical of similar luminosity AGNs. One object, SDSS J0132-0952, shows evidence of ionized intrinsic absorption. The most-luminous SDSS double-peaked emitter, SDSS J2125-0813, has either an unusual flat spectrum (~1) or is also highly absorbed. It is the only double-peaked emitter for which no external illumination is necessary to account for the Balmer line emission. The strength of the Balmer-line emission in the remaining four objects suggests that the total line flux likely exceeds the viscous energy that can be extracted locally from the accretion disk and external illumination is necessary. All five double-peaked emitters have unusually strong X-ray emission relative to their UV/optical emission, which is the likely source of the external illumination necessary for the production of the observed strong broad lines. On average about 30% of their bolometric luminosities are emitted between 0.5-10keV. The spectral energy distributions of the five double-peaked emitters show the big blue bumps characteristic of radiatively efficient accretion flows. The Balmer line profiles, as well as the optical and X-ray fluxes of the double-peaked emitters, are highly variable on timescales of months to years in the AGN rest frame. 
0808.00858	Jet Production in Polarized pp Collisions at RHIC	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:C. A. Gagliardi, for the STAR Collaboration	Abstract:  The STAR Collaboration has measured the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry for inclusive jet production in polarized p+p collisions at sqrt{s} = 200 GeV. The results set significant new constraints on the gluon polarization within the nucleon. Future measurements of asymmetries for di-jet production will provide direct access to the momentum dependence of the gluon polarization, Delta g(x,Q^2). 
0808.00859	The Parts Determine the Whole except for n-Qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger States	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Scott N. Walck, David W. Lyons	Abstract:  The generalized n-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and their local unitary equivalents are the only pure states of n qubits that are not uniquely determined (among arbitrary states, pure or mixed) by their reduced density matrices of n-1 qubits. Thus, the generalized GHZ states are the only ones containing information at the n-party level. 
0808.00860	Phantom Accretion by Black Holes and the Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:J. A. S. Lima, S. H. Pereira, J. E. Horvath, Daniel C. Guariento	Abstract:  The accretion of a phantom fluid with non-zero chemical potential by black holes is discussed with basis on the Generalized Second Law of thermodynamics. For phantom fluids with positive temperature and negative chemical potential we demonstrate that the accretion process is possible, and that the condition guaranteeing the positiveness of the phantom fluid entropy coincides with the one required by Generalized Second Law. In particular, this result provides a complementary confirmation that cosmological phantom fluids do not need to have negative temperatures. 
0808.00861	Strategies for the Characteristic Extraction of Gravitational Waveforms	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:M. C. Babiuc, N. T. Bishop, B. Szilagyi, J. Winicour	Abstract:  We develop, test and compare new numerical and geometrical methods for improving the accuracy of extracting waveforms using characteristic evolution. The new numerical method involves use of circular boundaries to the stereographic grid patches which cover the spherical cross-sections of the outgoing null cones. We show how an angular version of numerical dissipation can be introduced into the characteristic code to damp the high frequency error arising form the irregular way the circular patch boundary cuts through the grid. The new geometric method involves use of the Weyl tensor component $Ψ_4$ to extract the waveform as opposed to the original approach via the Bondi news function. We develop the necessary analytic and computational formula to compute the $O(1/r)$ radiative part of $Ψ_4$ in terms of a conformally compactified treatment of null infinity. These methods are compared and calibrated in test problems based upon linearized waves. 
0808.00862	Four-Wave Mixing in Ultracold Atoms using Intermediate Rydberg States	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:E. Brekke, J. O. Day, T. G. Walker	Abstract:  Ultracold Rb atoms were used to demonstrate non-degenerate four-wave mixing through a Rydberg state. Continuous 5S-5P-nD two-photon excitation to the Rydberg state was combined with an nD-6P tuned laser in a phase matched geometry. The angular dependence, spatial profile, and dependence on detuning were investigated, showing good agreement with theory. Under optimum conditions 50 percent of the radiation was emitted into the phase-matched direction. 
0808.00863	Orthogonal bundles, theta characteristics and the symplectic strange duality	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Prakash Belkale	Abstract:  A basis for the space of generalized theta functions of level one for the spin groups, parameterized by the theta characteristics (the even theta characteristcs for the odd spin groups) on a curve, is shown to be projectively flat over the moduli space of curves (for Hitchin's connection). The symplectic strange duality conjecture, conjectured by Beauville is shown to hold for all curves of genus at least two, by using Abe's proof of the conjecture for generic curves, and the above monodromy result. 
0808.00864	A simple class of N=3 gauge/gravity duals	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Daniel Louis Jafferis, Alessandro Tomasiello	Abstract:  We find the gravity duals to an infinite series of N=3 Chern-Simons quiver theories. They are AdS_4 x M_7 vacua of M-theory, with M_7 in a certain class of 3-Sasaki-Einstein manifolds obtained by a quotient construction. The field theories can be engineered from a brane configuration; their geometry is summarized by a "hyperKaehler toric fan" that can be read off easily from the relative angles of the branes. The singularity at the tip of the cone over M_7 is generically not an orbifold. The simplest new manifolds we consider can be written as the biquotient U(1)\U(3)/U(1). We also comment on the relation between our theories and four-dimensional N=1 theories with the same quiver. 
0808.00865	Pressure-induced electronic mixing and enhancement of ferromagnetic ordering in EuX (X=Te, Se, S, O) magnetic semiconductors	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Narcizo M. Souza-Neto, Daniel Haskel, Yuan-Chieh Tseng, Gerard Lapertot	Abstract:  The pressure- and anion-dependent electronic structure of EuX (X=Te, Se, S, O) monochalcogenides is probed with element- and orbital-specific X-ray absorption spectroscopy in a diamond anvil cell. An isotropic lattice contraction enhances the ferromagnetic ordering temperature by inducing mixing of Eu 4{\it f} and 5{\it d} electronic orbitals. Anion substitution (Te $\to$ O) enhances competing exchange pathways through spin-polarized anion {\it p} states, counteracting the effect of the concomitant lattice contraction. The results have strong implications for efforts aimed at enhancing FM exchange interactions in thin films through interfacial strain or chemical substitutions. 
0808.00866	Constant-length substitutions and countable scrambled sets	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:François Blanchard (IML), Fabien Durand (LAMFA), Alejandro Maass (CMM)    	Abstract:  In this paper we provide examples of topological dynamical systems having either finite or countable scrambled sets. In particular we study conditions for the existence of Li-Yorke, asymptotic and distal pairs in constant--length substitution dynamical systems. Starting from a circle rotation we also construct a dynamical system having Li--Yorke pairs, none of which is recurrent. 
0808.00867	Tracking and physics validation studies of the simplified geometry description with $B^0_{(s)} \to h^+h^{'-}$ decays	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:M. Gersabeck, E. Rodrigues	Abstract:  This note validates the usage of the simplified detector geometry description. A sample of $B^0_{(s)} \to h^+h^{'-}$ decays was used to assess the tracking and physics performance with respect to what is obtained with the full detector description. No significant degradation of performance was found. 
0808.00868	Corrigendum and addendum to: Linearly recurrent subshifts have a finite number of non-periodic factors	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Fabien Durand (LAMFA)    	Abstract:  We prove that a subshift $(X,T)$ is linearly recurrent if and only if it is a primitive and proper $S$-adic subshift. This corrects Proposition 6 in F. Durand ({\it Ergod. Th. & Dynam. Sys. {\bf 20}} (2000), 1061--1078). 
0808.00869	Thermal inertia of main belt asteroids smaller than 100 km from IRAS data	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Marco Delbo (OCA), Paolo Tanga (OCA)    	Abstract:  Recent works have shown that the thermal inertia of km-sized near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of main belt asteroids (MBAs) with sizes (diameters) between 200 and 1,000 km. This confirms the idea that large MBAs, over hundreds millions of years,have developed a fine and thick thermally insulating regolith layer, responsible for the low values of their thermal inertia, whereas km-sized asteroids, having collisional lifetimes of only some millions years, have less regolith, and consequently a larger surface thermal inertia. Because it is believed that regolith on asteroids forms as a result of impact processes, a better knowledge of asteroid thermal inertia values and its correlation with size, taxonomic type, and density can be used as an important constraintfor modeling of impact processes on asteroids. However, our knowledge of asteroids' thermal inertia values is still based on few data points with NEAs covering the size range 0.1-20 km and MBAs that >100 km. Here, we use IRAS infrared measurements to estimate the thermal inertias of MBAs with diameters 100 km and known shapes and spin vector: filling an important size gap between the largest MBAs and the km-sized NEAs. An update to the inverse correlation between thermal inertia and diameter is presented. For some asteroids thermophysical modelling allowed us to discriminate between the two still possible spin vector solutions derived from optical lightcurve inversion. This is important for (720) Bohlinia: our preferred solution was predicted to be the correct one by Vokrouhlicky et al. (2003, Nature 425, 147) just on theoretical grounds. 
0808.00870	Some metrics on Teichmüller spaces of surfaces of infinite type	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Lixin Liu, Athanase Papadopoulos (IRMA)    	Abstract:  Unlike the case of surfaces of topologically finite type, there are several different Teichmüller spaces that are associated to a surface of topological infinite type. These Teichmüller spaces first depend (set-theoretically) on whether we work in the hyperbolic category or in the conformal category. They also depend, given the choice of a point of view (hyperbolic or conformal), on the choice of a distance function on Teichmüller space. Examples of distance functions that appear naturally in the hyperbolic setting are the length spectrum distance and the bi-Lipschitz distance, and there are other useful distance functions. The Teichmüller spaces also depend on the choice of a basepoint. The aim of this paper is to present some examples, results and questions on the Teichmüller theory of surfaces of infinite topological type that do not appear in the setting the Teichmüller theory of surfaces of finite type. In particular, we point out relations and differences between the various Teichmüller spaces associated to a given surface of topological infinite type. 
0808.00871	The Vacuum Structure, Special Relativity Theory and Quantum Mechanics Revisited: A Field Theory-No-Geometry Approach	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Nikolai N. Bogolubov Jr., Anatoliy K. Prykarpatsky, Ufuk Taneri	Abstract:  The main fundamental principles characterizing the vacuum field structure are formulated, the modeling of the related vacuum medium and charged point particle dynamics by means of devised field theoretic tools are analyzed. The Maxwell electrodynamic theory is revisited and newly derived from the suggested vacuum field structure principles, the classical special relativity theory relationship between the energy and the corresponding point particle mass is revisited and newly obtained. The Lorentz force expression with respect to arbitrary non-inertial reference frames is revisited and discussed in detail, some new interpretations of relations between the special relativity theory and quantum mechanics are presented. The famous quantum-mechanical Schrödinger type equations for a relativistic point particle in the external potential and magnetic fields within the quasiclassical approximation as the Planck constant $\hbar \to 0$ and the light velocity $c\to \infty$ are obtained. 
0808.00872	Stokes-space formalism for Bragg scattering in a fiber	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:C. J. McKinstrie	Abstract:  Optical frequency conversion by four-wave mixing (Bragg scattering) in a fiber is considered. The evolution of this process can be modeled using the signal and idler amplitudes, which are complex, or Stokes-like parameters, which are real. The Stokes-space formalism allows one to visualize power and phase information simultaneously, and produces a simple evolution equation for the Stokes parameters. 
0808.00873	Jet correlations from unintegrated parton distributions	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:F.Hautmann, H.Jung	Abstract:  Transverse-momentum dependent parton distributions can be introduced gauge-invariantly in QCD from high-energy factorization. We discuss Monte Carlo applications of these distributions to parton showers and jet physics, with a view to the implications for the Monte Carlo description of complex hadronic final states with multiple hard scales at the LHC. 
0808.00874	Vacuum Decay Time in Strong External Fields	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Lance Labun, Johann Rafelski	Abstract:  We consider dynamics of vacuum decay and particle production in the context of short pulse laser experiments. We identify and evaluate the invariant "materialization time," $τ$, the timescale for the conversion of an electromagnetic field energy into particles, and we compare to the laser related time scales. 
0808.00875	Squeezed states produced by modulation interaction and phase conjugation in fibers	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:C. J. McKinstrie	Abstract:  Number-state expansions are derived for the squeezed states produced by four-wave mixing (modulation interaction and phase conjugation) in fibers. These expansions are valid for arbitrary pump-induced coupling and dispersion-induced mismatch coefficients. To illustrate their use, formulas are derived for the associated field-quadrature and photon-number variances and correlations. 
0808.00876	Capacity Regions and Bounds for a Class of Z-interference Channels	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Nan Liu, Andrea Goldsmith	Abstract:  We define a class of Z-interference channels for which we obtain a new upper bound on the capacity region. The bound exploits a technique first introduced by Korner and Marton. A channel in this class has the property that, for the transmitter-receiver pair that suffers from interference, the conditional output entropy at the receiver is invariant with respect to the transmitted codewords. We compare the new capacity region upper bound with the Han/Kobayashi achievable rate region for interference channels. This comparison shows that our bound is tight in some cases, thereby yielding specific points on the capacity region as well as sum capacity for certain Z-interference channels. In particular, this result can be used as an alternate method to obtain sum capacity of Gaussian Z-interference channels. We then apply an additional restriction on our channel class: the transmitter-receiver pair that suffers from interference achieves its maximum output entropy with a single input distribution irrespective of the interference distribution. For these channels we show that our new capacity region upper bound coincides with the Han/Kobayashi achievable rate region, which is therefore capacity-achieving. In particular, for these channels superposition encoding with partial decoding is shown to be optimal and a single-letter characterization for the capacity region is obtained. 
0808.00877	Local moments and magnetic order in the two-dimensional Anderson-Mott transition	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Maria Elisabetta Pezzoli, Federico Becca, Michele Fabrizio, Giuseppe Santoro	Abstract:  We study the role of electronic correlation in a disordered two-dimensional model by using a variational wave function that can interpolate between Anderson and Mott insulators. Within this approach, the Anderson-Mott transition can be described both in the paramagnetic and in the magnetic sectors. In the latter case, we find evidence for the formation of local magnetic moments that order before the Mott transition. The charge gap opening in the Mott insulator is accompanied by the vanishing of the $\lim_{q\to 0} \overline{< n_q>< n_{-q}>}$ (the bar denoting the impurity average), which is related to the compressibility fluctuations. The role of a frustrating (second-neighbor) hopping is also discussed, with a particular emphasis to the formation of metastable spin-glass states. 
0808.00878	Ferromagnetism in multi-band Kondo lattice model	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:A.Sharma, W.Nolting	Abstract:  The ferromagnetic spin exchange interaction between the itinerant electrons and localized moments on a periodic lattice, studied within the so-called Kondo lattice model (KLM), is considered for multiband situation where the hopping integral is a matrix, in general. The modified RKKY theory, wherein one can map such a model onto an effective Heisenberg-like system, is extended to a multi-band case with finite bandwidth and hybridization on a simple cubic lattice. As an input for the evaluation of the effective exchange integrals, one requires the multi-band electronic self energy which is taken from an earlier proposed ansatz. Using the above procedure, we determine the magnetic properties of the system like Curie temperature while calculating the chemical potential and magnetization within a self consistent scheme for various values of system parameters. The results are discussed in detail and the model is motivated in order to study the electronic, transport and magnetic properties of real materials like GdN. 
0808.00879	Wavelet analysis of non-Gaussian anisotropies from primordial voids in simulated maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Fabio Noviello	Abstract:  Phase transitions taking place during the inflationary epoch give rise to bubbles of true vacuum embedded in the false vacuum. These bubbles can imprint a distinctive signal on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We evaluate the feasibility of detecting these signatures with waveletsin CMB maps, such as those that will be made available by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Planck mission. 
0808.00880	Ricci flows, wormholes and critical phenomena	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Viqar Husain, Sanjeev S. Seahra	Abstract:  We study the evolution of wormhole geometries under Ricci flow using numerical methods. Depending on values of initial data parameters, wormhole throats either pinch off or evolve to a monotonically growing state. The transition between these two behaviors exhibits a from of critical phenomena reminiscent of that observed in gravitational collapse. Similar results are obtained for initial data that describe space bubbles attached to asymptotically flat regions. Our numerical methods are applicable to "matter-coupled" Ricci flows derived from conformal invariance in string theory. 
0808.00881	Signatures of clumpy dark matter in the global 21 cm background signal	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:D. T. Cumberbatch, M. Lattanzi, J. Silk	Abstract:  We examine the extent to which the self-annihilation of supersymmetric neutralino dark matter, as well as light dark matter, influences the rate of heating, ionisation and Lyman-alpha pumping of interstellar hydrogen and helium and the extent to which this is manifested in the 21cm global background signal. We fully consider the enhancements to the annihilation rate from DM halos and substructures within them. We find that the influence of such structures can result in significant changes in the differential brightness temperature. The changes at redsfhits z<25 are likely to be undetectable due to the presence of the astrophysical signal; however, in the most favourable cases, deviations in the differential brightness temperature, relative to its value in the absence of self-annihilating DM, of up to ~20 mK at z=30 can occur. Thus we conclude that, in order to exclude these models, experiments measuring the global 21cm signal, such as EDGES and CORE, will need to reduce the systematics at 50 MHz to below 20 mK. 
0808.00882	Free-energy transition in a gas of non-interacting nonlinear wave-particles	Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)	Authors:Andrea Fratalocchi, Claudio Conti, Giancarlo Ruocco, Stefano Trillo	Abstract:  We investigate the dynamics of a gas of non-interacting particle-like soliton waves, demonstrating that phase transitions originate from their collective behavior. This is predicted by solving exactly the nonlinear equations and by employing methods of the statistical mechanics of chaos. In particular, we show that a suitable free energy undergoes a metamorphosis as the input excitation is increased, thereby developing a first order phase transition whose measurable manifestation is the formation of shock waves. This demonstrates that even the simplest phase-space dynamics, involving independent (uncoupled) degrees of freedom, can sustain critical phenomena. 
0808.00883	Robust 4-manifolds and robust embeddings	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Vyacheslav Krushkal	Abstract:  A link in the 3-sphere is homotopically trivial, according to Milnor, if its components bound disjoint maps of disks in the 4-ball. This paper concerns the question of what spaces give rise to the same class of homotopically trivial links when used in place of disks in an analogous definition. We show that there are 4-manifolds for which this property depends on their embedding in the 4-ball. This work is motivated by the A-B slice problem, a reformulation of the 4-dimensional topological surgery conjecture. As a corollary this provides a new, secondary, obstruction in the A-B slice problem for a certain class of decompositions of D^4. 
0808.00884	The Nekrasov Conjecture for Toric Surfaces	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Elizabeth Gasparim, Chiu-Chu Melissa Liu	Abstract:  The Nekrasov conjecture predicts a relation between the partition function for N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and the Seiberg-Witten prepotential. For instantons on R^4, the conjecture was proved, independently and using different methods, by Nekrasov-Okounkov, Nakajima-Yoshioka, and Braverman-Etingof. We prove a generalized version of the conjecture for instantons on noncompact toric surfaces. 
0808.00885	Electrostatic Background Forces due to Varying Contact Potentials in Casimir Experiments	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Steve K. Lamoreaux	Abstract:  The existence of a monotonic distance dependent contact potential between two plates in a Casimir experiment leads to an additional electrostatic force that is significantly different from the case of a constant potential. Such a varying potential can arise if there is a uniform gradient in the work function or contact potential across a plate, as opposed to random microscopic fluctuations associated with patch potentials. A procedure to compensate for this force is described for the case of an experiment where the electrostatic force is minimized at each measurement distance by applying a voltage between the plates. It is noted that the minimizing voltage is not the contact potential. 
0808.00886	Interstellar Krypton Abundances: The Detection of Kiloparsec-scale Differences in Galactic Nucleosynthetic History	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Stefan I. B. Cartledge, J. T. Lauroesch, David M. Meyer, U. J. Sofia, Geoffrey C. Clayton	Abstract:  We present an analysis of Kr I 1236 line measurements from 50 sight lines in the Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph data archives that have sufficiently high resolution and signal-to-noise ratio to permit reliable krypton-to-hydrogen abundance ratio determinations. The distribution of Kr/H ratios in this sample is consistent with a single value for the ISM within 5900 pc of the Sun, log(Kr/H) = -9.02+/-0.02, apart from a rough annulus from between about 600 and 2500 pc distant. The Kr/H ratio toward stars within this annulus is elevated by approximately 0.11 dex, similar to previously noted elevations of O/H and Cu/H gas-phase abundances beyond about 800 pc. A significant drop in the gas-phase N/O ratio in the same region suggests that this is an artifact of nucleosynthetic history. Since the physical scale of the annulus' inner edge is comparable to the radius of the Gould Belt and the outer limit of heliocentric distances where the D/H abundance ratio is highly variable, these phenomena may be related to the Gould Belt's origins. 
0808.00887	Microsupport of tempered solutions of D-Modules associated to smooth morphisms	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Teresa Monteiro Fernandes	Abstract:  Let $f:X\to Y$ be a smooth morphism of complex analytic manifolds and let $F$ be an $\mathbb{R}$-constructible complex on $Y$. Let $\cal{M}$ be a coherent $\shd_X$-module. We prove that the microsupport of the solution complex of $\shm$ in the tempered holomorphic functions $t \shh \text{om} (f^{-1} F, \sho_X)$, is contained in the 1-characteristic variety of $\cal{M}$ associated to $f$, and that the microsupport of the solution complex in the tempered microfunctions $tμhom(f^{-1}F, \sho_X)$ is contained in the 1-microcharacteristic variety of the microlocalized of $\shm$ along $T^*Y\times_Y X$. This applies in particular to the complex of solutions of $\shm$ in the sheaf of distributions holomorphic in the fibers of an arbitrary smooth morphism. 
0808.00888	Self-organized periodicity of protein clusters in growing bacteria	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Hui Wang, Ned S. Wingreen, Ranjan Mukhopadhyay	Abstract:  Chemotaxis receptors in E. coli form clusters at the cell poles and also laterally along the cell body, and this clustering plays an important role in signal transduction. Recently, experiments using flourrescence imaging have shown that, during cell growth, lateral clusters form at positions approximately periodically spaced along the cell body. In this paper, we demonstrate within a lattice model that such spatial organization could arise spontaneously from a stochastic nucleation mechanism. The same mechanism may explain the recent observation of periodic aggregates of misfolded proteins in E. coli.

Zitzer	Abstract:  We report the detection of very high-energy gamma-ray emission from the intermediate-frequency-peaked BL Lacertae object W Comae (z=0.102) by VERITAS. The source was observed between January and April 2008. A strong outburst of gamma-ray emission was measured in the middle of March, lasting for only four days. The energy spectrum measured during the two highest flare nights is fit by a power-law and is found to be very steep, with a differential photon spectral index of Gamma = 3.81 +- 0.35_stat +- 0.34_syst. The integral photon flux above 200GeV during those two nights corresponds to roughly 9% of the flux from the Crab Nebula. Quasi-simultaneous Swift observations at X-ray energies were triggered by the VERITAS observations. The spectral energy distribution of the flare data can be described by synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) or external-Compton (EC) leptonic jet models, with the latter offering a more natural set of parameters to fit the data. 
0808.00890	Laplacian spectrum for the nilpotent Kac-Moody Lie algebras	Rings and Algebras (math.RA)	Authors:Dmitry Fuchs, Constance Wilmarth	Abstract:  We prove that the maximal nilpotent subalgebra of a Kac-Moody Lie algebra has an (essentially unique) Euclidean metric with respect to which the Laplace operator in the chain complex is scalar on each component of a given degree. Moreover, both the Lie algebra structure and the metric are uniquely determined by this property. 
0808.00891	Dynamics of a stretched nonlinear polymer chain	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:M. Febbo, A. Milchev, V. Rostiashvili, T. A. Vilgis, D. Dimitrov	Abstract:  We study the relaxation dynamics of a coarse-grained polymer chain at different degrees of stretching by both analytical means and numerical simulations. The macromolecule is modelled as a string of beads, connected by anharmonic springs, subject to a tensile force applied at the end monomer of the chain while the other end is fixed at the origin of coordinates. The impact of bond non-linearity on the relaxation dynamics of the polymer at different degrees of stretching is treated analytically within the Gaussian self-consistent approach (GSC) and then compared to simulation results derived from two different methods: Monte-Carlo (MC) and Molecular Dynamics (MD). At low and medium degrees of chain elongation we find good agreement between GSC predictions and the Monte-Carlo simulations. However, for strongly stretched chains the MD method, which takes into account inertial effects, reveals two important aspects of the nonlinear interaction between monomers: (i) a coupling and energy transfer between the damped, oscillatory normal modes of the chain, and (ii) the appearance of non-vanishing contributions of a continuum of frequencies around the characteristic modes in the power spectrum of the normal mode correlation functions. 
0808.00892	Electron spin resonance in Kondo systems	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Elihu Abrahams, Peter Wölfle	Abstract:  We calculate the dynamical spin response of Kondo impurity and Kondo lattice systems within a semiphenomenological Fermi liquid description, at low temperatures $T<T_K$, the Kondo temperature, and low magnetic fields $B \ll k_B T_K/gμ_B$. Fermi liquid parameters are determined by comparison (i) with microscopic theory (numerical renormalization group) for the impurity model and (ii) with experiment for the lattice model. We find in the impurity case that the true impurity spin resonance has a width of the order of $T_K$ and disappears altogether if the $g$-factors of impurity spin and conduction electron spin are equal. However, there is an impurity-induced resonance contribution at the conduction electron resonance. The latter is broadened by spin lattice relaxation and is usually unobservable. In contrast, for the Anderson lattice in the Kondo regime we find a \textit{sharp} ESR resonance line only slightly shifted from the local resonance and broadened by spin lattice relaxation, the latter significantly reduced by both the effects of heavy fermion physics and ferromagnetic fluctuations. We conjecture that our findings explain the sharp ESR-lines recently observed in several heavy fermion compounds. 
0808.00893	The Landau gauge gluon and ghost propagator in the refined Gribov-Zwanziger framework in 3 dimensions	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:D. Dudal, J.A. Gracey, S.P. Sorella, N. Vandersickel, H. Verschelde	Abstract:  In previous works, we have constructed a refined version of the Gribov-Zwanziger action in 4 dimensions, by taking into account a novel dynamical effect. In this paper, we explore the 3-dimensional case. Analogously as in 4 dimensions, we obtain a ghost propagator behaving like $1/p^2$ in the infrared, while the gluon propagator reaches a finite nonvanishing value at zero momentum. Simultaneously, a clear violation of positivity by the gluon propagator is also found. This behaviour of the propagators turns out be in agreement with the recent numerical simulations.

0808.00895	Temperature and Spatial Dependence of the Superconducting and Pseudogap of NdFeAsO0.86F0.14	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:M. H. Pan, X. B. He, G. R. Li, J. F. Wendelken, R. Jin, A. S. Sefat, M. A. McGuire, B. C. Sales, D. Mandrus, E. W. Plummer	Abstract:  The discovery of superconductivity with a critical temperature exceeding 55 K in the iron-oxypnictides and related compounds has quite suddenly given the community a new set of materials - breaking the tyranny of copper. This new class of materials raises fundamental questions related to the origin of the electron pairing in the superconducting state and to the similarity to superconductivity in the cuprates. Here, we report spatially resolved measurements using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) of the newly discovered iron-based layered superconductor NdFeAsO0.86F0.14 (Tc = 48 K) as a function of temperature. The tunneling spectra at 17 K show a suppression of spectral intensity within +/- 10 meV, indicative of the opening of the superconducting gap (SG). Below Tc, the sample exhibits two characteristic gaps - a large one (18 meV) and a small one (9 meV) - existing in different spatial locations. Both gaps are closed above Tc at the bulk Tc, but only the small gap can be fitted with a superconducting gap function. This gap displays a BCS - like order parameter. Above Tc, at the same location where the small gap was observed, a pseudogap (PG) opens abruptly at a temperature just above Tc and closes at 120 K. In contrast to the cuprates, the SG and PG have competing order parameters. 
0808.00896	Kinematics and physical properties of Southern interacting galaxies: the minor merger AM 2306-721	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A.C.Krabbe, M.G.Pastoriza, Claudia Winge, I.Rodrigues, D.L.Ferreiro	Abstract:  We present an observational study about the effects of the interactions in the kinematics, stellar population and abundances of the components of the galaxy pair AM2306-721. Rotation curves for the main and companion galaxies were obtained, showing a deprojected velocity amplitude of 175 km/s and 185 km/s, respectively. The interaction between the main and companion galaxies was modeled using numerical N-body/hydrodynamical simulations, with the result indicating that the current stage of the merger would be about 250 Myr after perigalacticum. The spatial variation in the distribution of the stellar population components in both galaxies was analysed by fitting combinations of stellar population models of different age groups. The central region of main galaxy is dominated by an old (5-10 Gyr) population, while significant contributions from a young (200 Myr) and intermediate (1 Gyr) components are found in the disk, being enhanced in the direction of the tidal features. The stellar population of the companion galaxy is overall much younger, being dominated by components with 1 Gyr or less, quite widely spread over the whole disk. Spatial profiles of the oxygen abundance were obtained from the a grid of photoionization models using the R23 line ratio. The disk of the main galaxy shows a clear radial gradient, while the companion galaxy presents an oxygen abundance relatively homogeneous across the disk. The absence of an abundance gradient in the secondary galaxy is interpreted in terms of mixing by gas flows from the outer parts to the center of the galaxy due to the gravitational interaction with the more massive primary. 
0808.00897	The Great Season Climatic Oscillation and the Global Warming	Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)	Authors:Ahmed Boucenna	Abstract:  The present earth warming up is often explained by the atmosphere gas greenhouse effect. This explanation is in contradiction with the thermodynamics second law. The warming up by greenhouse effect is quite improbable. It is cloud reflection that gives to the earth s ground its 15 degres C mean temperature. Since the reflection of the radiation by gases is negligible, the role of the atmosphere greenhouse gases in the earth warming up by earth radiation reflection loses its importance. We think that natural climatic oscillations contribute more to earth climatic disturbances. The oscillation that we hypothesize to exist has a long period (800 to 1000 years). The glacier melting and regeneration cycles lead to variations in the cold region ocean water density and thermal conductibility according to their salinity. These variations lead one to think about a macro climate oscillating between maximum hot and minimum cold temperatures. This oscillation is materialized by the passages of the planet through hot, mild, and cold eras, leading to the great season climatic oscillation phenomenon (GSCO). Thus, our planet lives four great seasons a great spring, a great summer, a great winter and a great autumn/fall, making a great year embracing our four small classical yearly seasons. The probabilistic character of the parameters that are at the origin of this climatic oscillation makes the long-term prediction less precise but the deterministic tendencies and the resonance phenomena give precious information on our planet climatic future. The present warming up is well interpreted in the frame of the great season climatic oscillation theory. 
0808.00898	Ultraluminous X-ray Sources and Their Nebulae	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Pavel Abolmasov	Abstract:  One of the interesting features of Ultraluminous X-ray sources is that many of them are surrounded by luminous nebulae exhibiting diverse observational properties. In different cases the nebulae are photoionized or shock-powered. Generally, the two energy sources appear to coexist. ULX bubble nebulae may be considered a new class of shock-powered nebulae similar to upscaled versions of stellar wind bubbles. Their expansion rates support constant energy influx rather than single powerful events like Hypernova explosions. 
0808.00899	Placing direct limits on the mass of earth-bound dark matter	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Stephen L. Adler	Abstract:  We point out that by comparing the total mass (in gravitational units) of the earth-moon system, as determined by lunar laser ranging, with the sum of the lunar mass as independently determined by its gravitational action on satellites or asteroids, and the earth mass, as determined by the LAGEOS geodetic survey satellite, one can get a direct measure of the mass of earth-bound dark matter lying between the radius of the moon's orbit and the geodetic satellite orbit. Current data show that the mass of such earth-bound dark matter must be less than $4 \times 10^{-9}$ of the earth's mass. 
0808.00900	Search for the highly suppressed decays B- -> K+ pi- pi- and B- -> K- K- pi+	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We report a search for the decays B- -> K+ pi- pi- and B- -> K- K- pi+, which are highly suppressed in the Standard Model. Using a sample of (467 +/- 5) x 10^6 BBbar pairs collected with the BaBar detector, we do not see any evidence of these decays and determine 90% confidence level upper limits of BF(B- -> K+ pi- pi-) < 9.5 x 10^-7 and BF(B- -> K- K- pi+) < 1.6 x 10^-7 on the corresponding branching fractions, including systematic uncertainties. 
0808.00901	QCD, Tevatron results and LHC prospects	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:V. Daniel Elvira, for the D0 Collaboration, the CDF Collaboration	Abstract:  We present a summary of the most recent measurements relevant to Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) delivered by the D0 and CDF Tevatron experiments by May 2008. CDF and D0 are moving toward precision measurements of QCD based on data samples in excess of 1 fb-1. The inclusive jet cross sections have been extended to forward rapidity regions and measured with unprecedented precision following improvements in the jet energy calibration. Results on dijet mass distributions, bbbar dijet production using tracker based triggers, underlying event in dijet and Drell-Yan samples, inclusive photon and diphoton cross sections complete the list of measurements included in this paper. Good agreement with pQCD within errors is observed for jet production measurements. An improved and consistent theoretical description is needed for photon+jets processes. Collisions at the LHC are scheduled for early fall 2008, opening an era of discoveries at the new energy frontier, 5-7 times higher than that of the Tevatron. 
0808.00902	Resonant electronic states and I-V curves of Fe/MgO/Fe(100) tunnel junctions	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Ivan Rungger, Oleg N. Mryasov, Stefano Sanvito	Abstract:  The bias dependence of the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of Fe/MgO/Fe tunnel junctions is investigated theoretically with a fully self-consistent scheme that combines the non-equilibrium Green's functions method with density functional theory. At voltages smaller than 20 mVolt the I-V characteristics and the TMR are dominated by resonant transport through narrow interface states in the minority spin-band. In the parallel configuration this contribution is quenched by a voltage comparable to the energy width of the interface state, whereas it persists at all voltages in the anti-parallel configuration. At higher bias the transport is mainly determined by the relative positions of the $Δ_1$ band-edges in the two Fe electrodes, which causes a decrease of the TMR. 
0808.00903	Nonlocal Modulation of Entangled Photons	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:S. E. Harris	Abstract:  We consider ramifications of the use of high speed light modulators to questions of correlation and measurement of time-energy entangled photons. Using phase modulators, we find that temporal modulation of one photon of an entangled pair, as measured by correlation in the frequency domain, may be negated or enhanced by modulation of the second photon. Using amplitude modulators we describe a Fourier technique for measurement of biphoton wave functions with slow detectors. 
0808.00904	Notes on toric Sasaki-Einstein seven-manifolds and AdS_4/CFT_3	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Dario Martelli, James Sparks	Abstract:  We study the geometry and topology of two infinite families Y^{p,k} of Sasaki-Einstein seven-manifolds, that are expected to be AdS_4/CFT_3 dual to families of N=2 superconformal field theories in three dimensions. These manifolds, labelled by two positive integers p and k, are Lens space bundles S^3/Z_p over CP^2 and CP^1 x CP^1, respectively. The corresponding Calabi-Yau cones are toric. We present their toric diagrams and gauged linear sigma model charges in terms of p and k, and find that the Y^{p,k} manifolds interpolate between certain orbifolds of the homogeneous spaces S^7, M^{3,2} and Q^{1,1,1}. 
0808.00905	Supersymmetric isolated horizons in ADS spacetime	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Ivan Booth, Tomas Liko	Abstract:  We discuss various physical aspects of nonextremal, extremal and supersymmetric black holes in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (ADS) spacetimes. Specifically, we discuss how the isolated horizon (IH) framework leads to an ambiguity-free description of rotating black holes in these spacetimes. We then apply this framework to investigate the properties of supersymmetric isolated horizons (SIHs) in four-dimensional N = 2 gauged supergravity. Among other results we find that they are necessarily extremal, that rotating SIHs must have non-trivial electromagnetic fields, and that non-rotating SIHs necessarily have constant curvature horizon cross sections and a magnetic (though not electric) charge. 
0808.00906	Divergent resistance at the Dirac point in graphene: Evidence for a transition in a high magnetic field	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Joseph G. Checkelsky, Lu Li, N. P. Ong	Abstract:  We have investigated the behavior of the resistance of graphene at the $n=0$ Landau Level in an intense magnetic field $H$. Employing a low-dissipation technique (with power $P<$3 fW), we find that, at low temperature $T$, the resistance at the Dirac point $R_0(H)$ undergoes a 1000-fold increase from $\sim$10 k$Ω$ to 40 M$Ω$ within a narrow interval of field. The abruptness of the increase suggests that a transition to an insulating, ordered state occurs at the critical field $H_c$. Results from 5 samples show that $H_c$ depends systematically on the disorder, as measured by the offset gate voltage $V_0$. Samples with small $V_0$ display a smaller critical field $H_c$. Empirically, the steep increase in $R_0$ fits acccurately a Kosterlitz-Thouless-type correlation length over 3 decades. The curves of $R_0$ vs. $T$ at fixed $H$ approach the thermal-activation form with a gap $Δ\sim$15 K as $H\to H_c^{-}$, consistent with a field-induced insulating state. 
0808.00907	Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in trapped quasi-two-dimensional Fermi gas near a Feshbach resonance	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Wei Zhang, G.-D. Lin, L.-M. Duan	Abstract:  We study the superfluid transition in a quasi-two-dimensional Fermi gas with a magnetic field tuning through a Feshbach resonance. Using an effective two-dimensional Hamiltonian with renormalized interaction between atoms and dressed molecules, we investigate the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature by studying the phase fluctuation effect. We also take into account the trapping potential in the radial plane, and discuss the number and superfluid density distributions. These results can be compared to experimental outcomes for gases prepared in one-dimensional optical lattices. 
0808.00908	Systematic Comparison of Jet Energy-Loss Schemes in a realistic hydrodynamic medium	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Steffen A. Bass, Charles Gale, Abhijit Majumder, Chiho Nonaka, Guang-You Qin, Thorsten Renk, Jörg Ruppert	Abstract:  We perform a systematic comparison of three different jet energy-loss approaches. These include the Armesto-Salgado-Wiedemann scheme based on the approach of Baier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peigne-Schiff and Zakharov (BDMPS-Z/ASW), the Higher Twist approach (HT) and a scheme based on the approach of Arnold-Moore-Yaffe (AMY). In this comparison, an identical medium evolution will be utilized for all three approaches: not only does this entail the use of the same realistic three-dimensional relativistic fluid dynamics (RFD) simulation, but also includes the use of identical initial parton-distribution functions and final fragmentation functions. We are, thus, in a unique position, not only to isolate fundamental differences between the various approaches, but also to make rigorous calculations for different experimental measurements using "state of the art" components. All three approaches are reduced to a version which contains only one free tunable parameter, this is then related to the well known transport parameter $\hat{q}$. We find that the parameters of all three calculations can be adjusted to provide a good description of inclusive data on $R_{AA}$ versus transverse momentum. However, we do observe slight differences in their predictions for the centrality and azimuthal angular dependence of $R_{AA}$ vs. $p_T$. We also note that the value of the transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ in the three approaches to describe the data differs significantly. 
0808.00909	Buckling Thin Disks and Ribbons with Non-Euclidean Metrics	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Christian D. Santangelo	Abstract:  I consider the problem of a thin membrane on which a metric has been prescribed, for example by lithographically controlling the local swelling properties of a polymer thin film. While any amount of swelling can be accommodated locally, geometry prohibits the existence of a global strain-free configuration. To study this geometrical frustration, I introduce a perturbative approach. I compute the optimal shape of an annular, thin ribbon as a function of its width. The topological constraint of closing the ribbon determines a relationship between the mean curvature and number of wrinkles that prevents a complete relaxation of the compression strain induced by swelling and buckles the ribbon out of the plane. These results are then applied to thin, buckled disks, where the expansion works surprisingly well. I identify a critical radius above which the disk in-plane strain cannot be relaxed completely. 
0808.00910	Toward the AdS/CFT Gravity Dual for High Energy Collisions. 3.Gravitationally Collapsing Shell and Quasiequilibrium	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Shu Lin, Edward Shuryak	Abstract:  The equilibration of matter and onset of hydrodynamics can be understood in the AdS/CFT context as a gravitational collapse process, in which "collision debris" create a horizon. In this paper we consider the simplest geometry possible, a flat shell (or membrane) falling in the holographic direction toward the horizon. The metric is a combination of two well known solutions: thermal AdS above the shell and pure AdS below, while motion of the shell is given by the Israel junction condition. Furthermore, when the shell motion can be considered slow, we were able to solve for two-point functions of all boundary stress tensor and found that an observer on the boundary sees a very peculiar $quasiequilibrium$: while the average stress tensor $<T_{μν>}$ contains the equilibrium plasma energy and pressure at all times, the spectral densities of the correlators(related with occupation probabilities of the modes) reveal additional oscillating terms absent in equilibrium. This is explained by the "echo" phenomenon, a partial return of the field coherence at certain "echo" times. 
0808.00911	A Confirmation of the Strong Clustering of Distant Red Galaxies at 2 < z <3	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ryan F. Quadri, Rik J. Williams, Kyoung-Soo Lee, Marijn Franx, Pieter van Dokkum, Gabriel B. Brammer	Abstract:  Recent studies have shown that distant red galaxies (DRGs), which dominate the high-mass end of the galaxy population at z~2.5, are more strongly clustered than the population of blue star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts. However these studies have been severely hampered by the small sizes of fields having deep near-infrared imaging. Here we use the large UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey to study the clustering of DRGs. The size and depth of this survey allows for an unprecedented measurement of the angular clustering of DRGs at 2<z_phot<3 and K<21. The correlation function shows the expected power law behavior, but with an apparent upturn at theta<~10". We deproject the angular clustering to infer the spatial correlation length, finding 10.6+-1.6 h^-1 Mpc. We use the halo occupation distribution framework to demonstrate that the observed strong clustering of DRGs is not consistent with standard models of galaxy clustering, confirming previous suggestions that were based on smaller samples. Inaccurate photometric redshifts could artificially enhance the observed clustering, however significant systematic redshift errors would be required to bring the measurements into agreement with the models. Another possibility is that the underlying assumption that galaxies interact with their large-scale environment only through halo mass is not valid, and that other factors drive the evolution of the oldest, most massive galaxies at z~2. 
0808.00912	Moduli spaces of Chern-Simons quiver gauge theories and AdS_4/CFT_3	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Dario Martelli, James Sparks	Abstract:  We analyse the classical moduli spaces of supersymmetric vacua of 3d N=2 Chern-Simons quiver gauge theories. We show quite generally that the moduli space of the 3d theory always contains a baryonic branch of a parent 4d N=1 quiver gauge theory, where the 4d baryonic branch is determined by the vector of 3d Chern-Simons levels. In particular, starting with a 4d quiver theory dual to a 3-fold singularity, for certain general choices of Chern-Simons levels this branch of the moduli space of the corresponding 3d theory is a 4-fold singularity. Our results lead to a simple general method, using existing 4d techniques, for constructing candidate 3d N=2 superconformal Chern-Simons quivers with AdS_4 gravity duals. As simple, but non-trivial, examples, we identify a family of Chern-Simons quiver gauge theories which are candidate AdS_4/CFT_3 duals to an infinite class of toric Sasaki-Einstein seven-manifolds with explicit metrics. 
0808.00913	Electronic Griffiths phase of the d=2 Mott transition	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:E. C. Andrade, E. Miranda, V. Dobrosavljevic	Abstract:  We investigate the effects of disorder within the T=0 Brinkman-Rice (BR) scenario for the Mott metal-insulator transition (MIT) in two dimensions (2d). For sufficiently weak disorder the transition retains the Mott character, as signaled by the vanishing of the local quasiparticles (QP) weights Z_{i} and strong disorder screening at criticality. In contrast to the behavior in high dimensions, here the local spatial fluctuations of QP parameters are strongly enhanced in the critical regime, with a distribution function P(Z) ~ Z^{α-1} and αtends to zero at the transition. This behavior indicates a robust emergence of an electronic Griffiths phase preceding the MIT, in a fashion surprisingly reminiscent of the "Infinite Randomness Fixed Point" scenario for disordered quantum magnets. 
0808.00914	Hubble Space Telescope Spectroscopic Observations of the Narrow-Line Region in Nearby Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jonelle L. Walsh, Aaron J. Barth, Luis C. Ho, Alexei V. Filippenko, Hans-Walter Rix, Joseph C. Shields, Marc Sarzi, Wallace L. W. Sargent	Abstract:  (Abridged) We present STIS observations of 14 nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, including 13 LINERs and 1 Seyfert, taken at multiple parallel slit positions centered on the galaxy nuclei and covering the H-alpha spectral region. For each galaxy, we measure the emission-line velocities, line widths, and strengths, to map out the inner narrow-line region structure. There is a wide diversity among the velocity fields: in a few galaxies the gas is clearly in disk-like rotation, while in other galaxies the gas kinematics appear chaotic or are dominated by radial flows with multiple velocity components. The [S II] line ratio indicates a radial stratification in gas density, with a sharp increase within the inner 10-20 pc, in the majority of the Type 1 objects. We examine how the [N II] 6583 line width varies as a function of aperture size over a range of spatial scales, extending from scales comparable to the black hole's sphere of influence to scales dominated by the host galaxy's bulge. For most galaxies in the sample, we find that the emission-line velocity dispersion is largest within the black hole's gravitational sphere of influence, and decreases with increasing aperture size toward values similar to the bulge stellar velocity dispersion measured within ground-based apertures. Future dynamical modeling in order to determine black hole masses for a few objects in this sample may be worthwhile, although disorganized motion will limit the accuracy of the mass measurements. 
0808.00915	Atmospheric Consequences of Cosmic Ray Variability in the Extragalactic Shock Model II: Revised ionization levels and their consequences	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A.L. Melott (University of Kansas), D.Atri, B.C. Thomas, M.V. Medvedev, G.W. Wilson, M.J. Murray	Abstract:  It has been suggested that galactic shock asymmetry induced by our galaxy's infall toward the Virgo Cluster may be a source of periodicity in cosmic ray exposure as the solar system oscillates perpendicular to the galactic plane. Here we investigate a mechanism by which cosmic rays might affect terrestrial biodiversity, ionization and dissociation in the atmosphere, resulting in depletion of ozone and a resulting increase in the dangerous solar UVB flux on the ground, with an improved ionization background computation averaged over a massive ensemble (about 7 x 10^5) shower simulations. We study minimal and full exposure to the postulated extragalactic background. The atmospheric effects are greater than with our earlier, simplified ionization model. At the lower end of the range effects are too small to be of serious consequence. At the upper end of the range, ~6 % global average loss of ozone column density exceeds that currently experienced due to effects such as accumulated chlorofluorocarbons. The intensity is less than a nearby supernova or galactic gamma-ray burst, but the duration would be about 10^6 times longer. Present UVB enhancement from current ozone depletion ~3% is a documented stress on the biosphere, but a depletion of the magnitude found at the upper end of our range would double the global average UVB flux. For estimates at the upper end of the range of the cosmic ray variability over geologic time, the mechanism of atmospheric ozone depletion may provide a major biological stress, which could easily bring about major loss of biodiversity. Future high energy astrophysical observations will resolve the question of whether such depletion is likely. 
0808.00916	Finite Size Scaling of Classical Long-Ranged Ising Chains and the Criticality of Dissipative Quantum Impurity Models	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Stefan Kirchner, Qimiao Si, Kevin Ingersent	Abstract:  Motivated in part by quantum criticality in dissipative Kondo systems, we revisit the finite-size scaling of a classical Ising chain with 1/r^{2-epsilon} interactions. For 1/2<epsilon<1, the scaling of the dynamical spin susceptibility is sensitive to the degree of "winding" of the interaction under periodic boundary conditions. Infinite winding yields the expected mean-field behavior, whereas without any winding the scaling is of an interacting omega/T form. The contrast with the behavior of the Bose-Fermi Kondo model suggests a breakdown of a mapping from the quantum model to a classical one due to the smearing of the Kondo spin flips by the continuum limit taken in this mapping. 
0808.00917	Langlands Functoriality Conjecture	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Jae-Hyun Yang	Abstract:  Functoriality conjecture is one of the central subjects of the present-day mathematics. Functoriality is the profound problem formulated by Robert Langlands in the late 1960s in order to establish nonabelian class field theory. In this expository paper, we describe the Langlands-Shahidi method, the local and global Langlands conjectures and the converse theorems which are powerful tools for the establishment of functoriality of some important cases, and survey the interesting results related to functoriality conjecture. 
0808.00918	Host Galaxies of Luminous Quasars: Structural Properties and the Fundamental Plane	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Marsha J. Wolf, Andrew I. Sheinis (University of Wisconsin - Madison)    	Abstract:  We present stellar velocity dispersion measurements in the host galaxies of 10 luminous quasars (M_V < -23) using the Ca H&K lines in off-nuclear spectra. We combine these data with effective radii and magnitudes from the literature to place the host galaxies on the Fundamental Plane (FP) where their properties are compared to other types of galaxies. We find that the radio-loud (RL) QSO hosts have similar properties to massive elliptical galaxies, while the radio-quiet (RQ) hosts are more similar to intermediate mass galaxies. The RL hosts lie at the upper extreme of the FP due to their large velocity dispersions (<sigma_*> = 321 km s^-1), low surface brightness (<mu_e(r)> = 20.8 mag arcsec^-2), and large effective radii (<R_e> = 11.4 kpc), and have <M_*> = 1.5 x 10^12 M_sun and <M/L> = 12.4. In contrast, properties of the RQ hosts are <sigma_*> = 241 km s^-1, <M_*> ~ 4.4 x 10^11 M_sun, and <M/L> ~ 5.3. The distinction between these galaxies occurs at sigma_* ~ 300 km s^-1, R_e ~ 6 kpc, and corresponding M_* ~ 5.9 +/- 3.5 x 10^11 M_sun. Our data support previous results that PG QSOs are related to gas-rich galaxy mergers that form intermediate-mass galaxies, while RL QSOs reside in massive early-type galaxies, most of which also show signs of recent mergers or interactions. Most previous work has drawn these conclusions by using estimates of the black hole mass and inferring host galaxy properties from that, while here we have relied purely on directly measured host galaxy properties. 
0808.00919	Cluster Magnetic Fields from Galactic Outflows	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. Donnert, K. Dolag, H. Lesch, E. Müller	Abstract:  We performed cosmological, magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to follow the evolution of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters, exploring the possibility that the origin of the magnetic seed fields are galactic outflows during the star-burst phase of galactic evolution. To do this we coupled a semi-analytical model for magnetized galactic winds as suggested by \citet{2006MNRAS.370..319B} to our cosmological simulation. We find that the strength and structure of magnetic fields observed in galaxy clusters are well reproduced for a wide range of model parameters for the magnetized, galactic winds and do only weakly depend on the exact magnetic structure within the assumed galactic outflows. Although the evolution of a primordial magnetic seed field shows no significant differences to that of galaxy clusters fields from previous studies, we find that the magnetic field pollution in the diffuse medium within filaments is below the level predicted by scenarios with pure primordial magnetic seed field. We therefore conclude that magnetized galactic outflows and their subsequent evolution within the intra-cluster medium can fully account for the observed magnetic fields in galaxy clusters. Our findings also suggest that measuring cosmological magnetic fields in low-density environments such as filaments is much more useful than observing cluster magnetic fields to infer their possible origin. 
0808.00920	A Distributed and Deterministic TDMA Algorithm for Write-All-With-Collision Model	Operating Systems (cs.OS)	Authors:Mahesh Arumugam	Abstract:  Several self-stabilizing time division multiple access (TDMA) algorithms are proposed for sensor networks. In addition to providing a collision-free communication service, such algorithms enable the transformation of programs written in abstract models considered in distributed computing literature into a model consistent with sensor networks, i.e., write all with collision (WAC) model. Existing TDMA slot assignment algorithms have one or more of the following properties: (i) compute slots using a randomized algorithm, (ii) assume that the topology is known upfront, and/or (iii) assign slots sequentially. If these algorithms are used to transform abstract programs into programs in WAC model then the transformed programs are probabilistically correct, do not allow the addition of new nodes, and/or converge in a sequential fashion. In this paper, we propose a self-stabilizing deterministic TDMA algorithm where a sensor is aware of only its neighbors. We show that the slots are assigned to the sensors in a concurrent fashion and starting from arbitrary initial states, the algorithm converges to states where collision-free communication among the sensors is restored. Moreover, this algorithm facilitates the transformation of abstract programs into programs in WAC model that are deterministically correct.

This galaxy is extremely bright, i_850 = 23.10 +/- 0.01, and is strongly-lensed by the foreground massive galaxy cluster Abell 1689 (z=0.18). Stellar continuum is seen longward of the Ly-alpha emission line at ~7100 Å, while intergalactic H I produces strong absorption shortward of Ly-alpha. Two transmission spikes at ~6800 Angstroms (A) and ~7040 A are also visible, along with other structures at shorter wavelengths. Although fainter than a QSO, the absence of a strong central ultraviolet flux source in this star forming galaxy enables a measurement of the H I flux transmission in the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the vicinity of a high redshift object. We find that the effective H I optical depth of the IGM is remarkably high within a large 14 Mpc (physical) region surrounding the galaxy compared to that seen towards QSOs at similar redshifts. Evidently, this high-redshift galaxy is located in a region of space where the amount of H I is much larger than that seen at similar epochs in the diffuse IGM. We argue that observations of high-redshift galaxies like this one provide unique insights on the nascent stages of baryonic large-scale structures that evolve into the filamentary cosmic web of galaxies and clusters of galaxies observed in the present universe. 
0808.00922	Spectroscopy of globular clusters in the low-luminosity spiral galaxy NGC 45	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Marcelo D. Mora, Soeren S. Larsen, Markus Kissler-Patig	Abstract:  CONTEXT: Extragalactic globular clusters have been studied in elliptical galaxies and in a few luminous spiral galaxies, but little is known about globular clusters in low-luminosity spirals. AIMS: Past observations with the ACS have shown that NGC 45 hosts a large population of globular clusters (19), as well as several young star clusters. In this work we aim to confirm the bona fide globular cluster status for 8 of 19 globular cluster candidates and to derive metallicities, ages, and velocities. METHODS: VLT/FORS2 multislit spectroscopy in combination with the Lick/IDS system was used to derive velocities and to constrain metallicities and [alpha/Fe] element ratio of the globular clusters. RESULTS: We confirm the 8 globular clusters as bona fide globular clusters. Their velocities indicate halo or bulge-like kinematics, with little or no overall rotation. From absorption indices such as H_beta, H_gamma, and H_delta and the combined [MgFe]' index, we found that the globular clusters are metal-poor [Z/H]<=-0.33 dex and [alpha/Fe]<=0.0 element ratio. These results argue in favor of a population of globular clusters formed during the assembling of the galaxy. 
0808.00923	ZZ boundary states and fragmented AdS2 spaces	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Simone Giombi, Xi Yin	Abstract:  In this paper we show that Liouville gravity on the strip with Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov (ZZ) boundary conditions has a semi-classical interpretation in terms of fragmented AdS2 spacetime geometries. Further, we study the three-point functions of the ZZ boundary states, and show that they are dominated by multi-AdS2 instantons in the classical limit. 
0808.00924	Magnetism from $2p$ States in Alkaline Earth Monoxides: Trends with Varying N Impurity Concentration	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:V. Pardo, W.E. Pickett	Abstract:  $2p$-based magnetic moments and magnetic coupling are studied with density functional based methods for substitutional N in the alkaline earth monoxide series MgO, CaO, SrO, BaO. The hole is rather strongly localized near the N$^{2-}$ ion, being somewhat more so when strong on-site interactions are included in the calculations. Strong magnetic coupling is obtained in the itinerant electron limit but decreases strongly in the localized limit in which the Coulomb repulsion within the N $2p$ shell (U) is much greater than the N $2p$ impurity bandwidth (W). We find that this limit is appropriate for realistic N concentrations. Ordering on a simple cubic sublattice may maximize the magnetic coupling due to its high directionality. 
0808.00925	The simulated 21 cm signal during the epoch of reionization : full modeling of the Ly-alpha pumping	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Baek, P. Di Matteo, B. Semelin, F. Combes, Y. Revaz	Abstract:  The 21 cm emission of neutral hydrogen is the most promising probe of the epoch of reionization(EoR). In the next few years, the SKA pathfinders will provide statistical measurements of this signal. Numerical simulations predicting these observations are necessary to optimize the design of the instruments. The main difficulty is the computation of the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen which depends on the gas kinetic temperature and on the level of the local Lyman-alpha flux. A T_s >> T_cmb assumption is usual. However, this assumption does not apply early in the reionization history, or even later in the history as long as the sources of X-rays are too weak to heat the intergalactic medium significantly. This work presents the first EoR numerical simulations including, beside dynamics and ionizing continuum radiative transfer, a self-consistent treatment of the Ly-alpha radiative transfer. This allows us to compute the spin temperature more accurately. We use two different box sizes, 20 Mpc/h and 100 Mpc/h, and a star source model. Using the redshift dependence of average quantities, maps, and power spectra, we quantify the effect of using different assumptions to compute the spin temperature and the influence of the box size. The first effect comes from allowing for a signal in absorption. The magnitude of this effect depends on the amount of heating by hydrodynamic shocks and X-rays in the intergalactic medium(IGM). The second effects comes from using the real, local, Lyman-alpha flux. This effect is important for an average ionization fraction of less than 10%: it changes the overall amplitude of the 21 cm signal, and adds its own fluctuations to the power spectrum. 
0808.00926	A New FUSE Survey of Interstellar HD	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Theodore P. Snow, Teresa L. Ross, Joshua D. Destree, Meredith M. Drosback, Adam G. Jensen, Brian L. Rachford, Paule Sonnentrucker, Roger Ferlet	Abstract:  We have used archival FUSE data to complete a survey of interstellar HD in 41 lines of sight with a wide range of extinctions. This follow up to an earlier survey was made to further assess the utility of HD as a cosmological probe; to analyze the HD formation process; and to see what trends with other interstellar properties were present in the data. We employed the curve-of-growth method, supported by line profile fitting, to derive accurate column densities of HD. We find that the N(HD)/2N(H2) ratio is substantially lower than the atomic D/H ratio and conclude that the molecular ratio has no bearing on cosmology, because local processes are responsible for the formation of HD. Based on correlations with E(B-V), H2, CO, and iron depletion, we find that HD is formed in the densest portion of the clouds; the slope of the logN(HD)/log(H2) correlation is greater than 1.0, caused by the destruction rate of HD declining more slowly than that of H2; and, as a sidelight, that the depletions are density dependent.

0808.00929	Kondo Effect and Spin Glass Behavior of Dilute Iron Clusters in Silver Studied by Mössbauer Spectroscopy and Resistivity	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:W. T. Herrera, S. M. Ramos, E. M. Baggio-Saitovitch, F. J. Litterst	Abstract:  Thin films of silver containing 0.3 - 1.5 at % Fe have been prepared by vapor co-deposition. Depending on substrate temperature and iron concentration we could systematically follow the formation of nanometer size clusters of iron from initially dilute iron monomers. samples were characterized via X-ray diffraction, resistivity and Mössbauer spectroscopic measurements. The magnetic behavior derived from Mössbauer data can be best described with an ensemble of ferromagnetic mono-domain particles. The magnetic freezing observed at low temperatures, is controlled via the inter-particle interactions mediated via conduction electron polarization, i.e. RKKY interaction. The interaction of the cluster magnetic moments with the conduction electron sea is best quantified by the electrical resistivity data. For all studied concentrations we find a non-monotonic variation with temperature which can be understood by competing shielding of the cluster moments by conduction electron spin scattering due to Kondo effect and the magnetic coupling. 
0808.00930	A Line-Of-Sight Galaxy Cluster Collision: Simulated X-Ray Observations	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. A. Zuhone, P. M. Ricker, D. Q. Lamb, H.-Y. Yang	Abstract:  Several lines of evidence have suggested that the the galaxy cluster Cl~0024+17, an apparently relaxed system, is actually a collision of two clusters, the interaction occurring along our line of sight. In this paper we present a high-resolution $N$-body/hydrodynamics simulation of such a collision. We have created mock X-ray observations of our simulated system using MARX, a program that simulates the on-orbit performance of the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We analyze these simulated data to generate radial profiles of the surface brightness and temperature. At later times, $t = 2.0-3.0$ Gyr after the collision, the simulated surface brightness profiles are better fit by a superposition of two $β$-model profiles than a single profile, in agreement with the observations of Cl~0024+17. In general, due to projection effects, much of the post-collision density and temperature structure of the clusters is not seen in the observations. In particular, the observed temperatures from spectral fitting are much lower than the temperature of the hottest gas. We determine from our fitted profiles that if the system is modeled as a single cluster, the hydrostatic mass estimate is a factor $\sim$2-3 less than the actual mass, but if the system is modeled as two galaxy clusters in superposition, a hydrostatic mass estimation can be made which is accurate to within $\sim$10%. We examine some implications of these results for galaxy cluster X-ray surveys. 
0808.00931	Dynamical polarization, screening, and plasmons in gapped graphene	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:P.K. Pyatkovskiy	Abstract:  The one-loop polarization function of graphene has been calculated at zero temperature for arbitrary wavevector, frequency, chemical potential (doping), and band gap. The result is expressed in terms of elementary functions and is used to find the dispersion of the plasmon mode and the static screening within the random phase approximation. At long wavelengths the usual square root behaviour of plasmon spectra for two-dimensional (2D) systems is obtained. The presence of a small (compared to a chemical potential) gap leads to the appearance of a new undamped plasmon mode. At greater values of the gap this mode merges with the long-wavelength one, and vanishes when the Fermi level enters the gap. The screening of charged impurities at large distances differs from that in gapless graphene by slower decay of Friedel oscillations ($1/r^2$ instead of $1/r^3$), similarly to conventional 2D systems.

University of Michigan, (2). The CHARA Array, Georgia State University, (3). University of St. Andrews, Scotland, UK, (4).University of Cambridge, UK, (5).National Optical Astronomy Observatory, NOAO)    	Abstract:  We present the first resolved images of the eclipsing binary Beta Lyrae, obtained with the CHARA Array interferometer and the MIRC combiner in the H band. The images clearly show the mass donor and the thick disk surrounding the mass gainer at all six epochs of observation. The donor is brighter and generally appears elongated in the images, the first direct detection of photospheric tidal distortion due to Roche-lobe filling. We also confirm expectations that the disk component is more elongated than the donor and is relatively fainter at this wavelength. Image analysis and model fitting for each epoch were used for calculating the first astrometric orbital solution for Beta Lyrae, yielding precise values for the orbital inclination and position angle. The derived semi-ma jor axis also allows us to estimate the distance of Beta Lyrae; however, systematic differences between the models and the images limit the accuracy of our distance estimate to about 15%. To address these issues, we will need a more physical, self-consistent model to account for all epochs as well as the multi-wavelength information from the eclipsing light curves.

Asner, et al    	Abstract:  Analyzing $Υ(nS)$ decays acquired with the CLEO detector operating at the CESR $e^+e^-$ collider, we measure for the first time the product branching fractions ${\cal B}[Υ(nS)\toγχ_{b}((n-1)P_J)] \times {\cal B}[χ_{b}(n-1)P_J)\to X_i]$ for $n=2$ and 3, where $X_i$ denotes, for each $i$, one of the fourteen exclusive light-hadron final states for which we observe significant signals in both $χ_b(1P_J)$ and $χ_b(2P_J)$ decays. We also determine upper limits for the electric dipole (E1) transitions $Υ(3S) \to γχ_b(1P_J)$. 
0808.00934	Triangles of Baumslag-Solitar Groups	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Daniel Allcock	Abstract:  Our main result is that many triangles of Baumslag-Solitar groups collapse to finite groups, generalizing a famous example of Hirsch. A triangle of Baumslag-Solitar groups means a group with three generators, cyclically ordered, with each generator conjugating some power of the previous one to another power. There are six parameters, occurring in pairs, and we show that the triangle fails to be developable whenever one of the parameters divides its partner, except for a few special cases. Furthermore, under fairly general conditions, the group turns out to be finite and solvable of class<4. We obtain a lot of information about finite quotients, even when we cannot determine developability. 
0808.00935	Tailor-made Quantum Well-in-a-Well Systems: Their Bound States and Scattering Properties	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Naomi Jane Jacosalem, Cristine Villagonzalo	Abstract:  The resulting stationary states and scattering properties of an effective potential brought about by embedding a quantum well in another well are investigated in this work. The composite well system is constructed via a superposition of modified Poeschl - Teller potential wells. The energy spectrum in each composite well is obtained using the shooting method and the transport of a particle above this system is analyzed using the transfer matrix method. It is shown that decreasing the size of the embedded middle well lowers the ground state energy of the well-in-a-well system. Moreover, the bound states increase in number and become more evenly spaced. In addition, the transmission probability of a free particle incident above a composite well is lowest for the system with a large embedded well as compared to well-in-a-well systems of the same depth. Small variations in designed potential wells yield different quantum mechanical features. 
0808.00936	Preheating with Non-Standard Kinetic Term	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Jean Lachapelle, Robert H. Brandenberger (McGill University)    	Abstract:  We consider reheating after inflation in theories with a non-standard kinetic term. We show that the equation that exhibits parametric resonance is the Hill-Whittaker equation, which is a particular case of the more general Hill equation. This equation is in general more unstable than the Mathieu equation, such that narrow resonance preheating may be efficient in theories with a non-canonical kinetic term. 
0808.00937	Derivation of effective field theories	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Dimo I. Uzunov	Abstract:  A general self-consistency approach allows a thorough treatment of the corrections to the mean-field approximation (MFA). The natural extension of standard MFA with the help of a cumulant expansion leads to a new point of view on the effective field theories. The proposed approach can be used for a systematic treatment of fluctuation effects of various length scales and, perhaps, for the development of a new coarse graining procedure. We outline and justify our method by some preliminary calculations. Results are given for the critical temperature and the Landau parameters of the $φ^4$-theory -- the field counterpart of the Ising model. An important unresolved problem of the modern theory of phase transitions -- the problem for the calculation of the true critical temperature, is considered within the framework of the present approach. A comprehensive description of the ground state properties of many-body systems is also demonstrated.

In particular, we show that this quantity saturates exponentially fast to a constant when the sizes of the blocks are sufficiently large. Our result provides the first known example of an analytical calculation of the geometric entanglement for a gapped quantum many-body system in one dimension and far away from a quantum critical point.

The theory accounts in detail for the temperature-pressure phase diagram of ZrZn$_2$, while the main features of the diagram for UGe$_2$ are also described. Quantitative criteria are deduced for the U-type (type I) and Zr-type (type II) unconventional ferromagnetic superconductors with spin-triplet Cooper electron pairing. Some basic properties of quantum phase transitions are also elucidated.

Maitre	Abstract:  In this talk, we present the first, numerically stable, results for the one-loop amplitudes needed for computing W,Z + 3 jet cross sections at the LHC to next-to-leading order in the QCD coupling. We implemented these processes in BlackHat, an automated program based on on-shell methods. These methods scale very well with increasing numbers of external partons, and are applicable to a wide variety of problems of phenomenological interest at the LHC. 
0808.00942	Dissipative and nonequilibrium effects near a superconductor-metal quantum critical point	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Aditi Mitra	Abstract:  We present a microscopic derivation of the effect of current flow on a system near a superconductor-metal quantum critical point. The model studied is a 2d itinerant electron system where the electrons interact via an attractive interaction and are coupled to an underlying normal metal substrate which provides a source of dissipation, and also provides a source of inelastic scattering that allows a nonequilibrium steady state to reach. A nonequilibrium Keldysh action for the superconducting fluctuations on the normal side is derived. Current flow, besides its minimal coupling to the order parameter is found to give rise to two new effects. One is a source of noise that acts as an effective temperature $T_{eff} = e E v_F τ_{sc}$ where $E$ is the external electric field, $v_F$ the Fermi velocity, and $τ_{sc}$ is the escape time into the normal metal substrate. Secondly current flow also produces a drift of the order-parameter. Scaling equations for the superconducting gap and the current are derived and are found to be consistent with previous phenomenological treatments as long as a temperature $T \sim T_{eff}$ is included. The current induced drift is found to produce additional corrections to the scaling which are smaller by a factor of ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{E_F τ_{sc}})$, $E_F$ being the Fermi energy. 
0808.00943	Noncommutative Corrections to the Robertson-Walker metric	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:S. Fabi, B. Harms, A. Stern	Abstract:  Upon applying Chamseddine's noncommutative deformation of gravity we obtain the leading order noncommutative corrections to the Robertson-Walker metric tensor. We get an isotropic inhomogeneous metric tensor for a certain choice of the noncommutativity parameters. Moreover, the singularity of the commutative metric at $t=0$ is replaced by a more involved space-time structure in the noncommutative theory. In a toy model we construct a scenario where there is no singularity at $t=0$ at leading order in the noncommutativity parameter. Although singularities may still be present for nonzero $t$, they need not be the source of all time-like geodesics and the result resembles a bouncing cosmology. 
0808.00944	Improving Quantum State Estimation with Mutually Unbiased Bases	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Robert B. A. Adamson, Aephraim M. Steinberg	Abstract:  When used in quantum state estimation, projections onto mutually unbiased bases have the ability to maximize information extraction per measurement and to minimize redundancy. We present the first experimental demonstration of quantum state tomography of two-qubit polarization states to take advantage of mutually unbiased bases. We demonstrate improved state estimation as compared to standard measurement strategies and discuss how this can be understood from the structure of the measurements we use. We experimentally compared our method to the standard state estimation method for three different states and observe that the infidelity was up to 1.84+/-0.06 times lower using our technique than it was using standard state estimation methods.

Hernandez-Ruiz, M. A. Perez	Abstract:  We study the sensitivity for testing the anomalous triple gauge couplings $ZZγ$ and $Zγγ$ via the process $e^+e^-\to ν\barνγ$ at high energy linear colliders. For integrated luminosities of 500 $fb^{-1}$ and center of mass energies between 0.5 and 1.5 $TeV$, we find that this process can provide tests of the triple neutral gauge boson couplings of order $10^{-4}$, one order of magnitude lower than the standard model prediction.

Snively	Abstract:  Let D be a simple digraph without loops or digons. For any v in V(D) let N_1(v) be the set of all nodes at out-distance 1 from v and let N_2(v) be the set of all nodes at out-distance 2. We provide sufficient conditions under which there must exist some v in V(D) such that |N_1(v)| is less than or equal to |N_2(v)|, as well as examine properties of a minimal graph which does not have such a node. We show that if one such graph exists, then there exist infinitely many strongly-connected graphs having no such vertex. 
0808.00947	Suppressed conductance in a metallic graphene nano-junction	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Haidong Li, Lin Wang, Yisong Zheng	Abstract:  The linear conductance spectrum of a metallic graphene junction formed by interconnecting two gapless graphene nanoribbons is calculated. A strong conductance suppression appears in the vicinity of the Dirac point. We found that such a conductance suppression arises from the antiresonance effect associated with the edge state localized at the zigzag-edged shoulder of the junction. The conductance valley due to the antiresonance is rather robust in the presence of the impurity and vacancy scattering. And the center of the conductance valley can be readily tuned by an electric field exerted on the wider nanoribbon. 
0808.00948	Capacity of a Class of Diamond Channels	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Wei Kang, Sennur Ulukus	Abstract:  We study a special class of diamond channels which was introduced by Schein in 2001. In this special class, each diamond channel consists of a transmitter, a noisy relay, a noiseless relay and a receiver. We prove the capacity of this class of diamond channels by providing an achievable scheme and a converse. The capacity we show is strictly smaller than the cut-set bound. Our result also shows the optimality of a combination of decode-and-forward (DAF) and compress-and-forward (CAF) at the noisy relay node. This is the first example where a combination of DAF and CAF is shown to be capacity achieving. Finally, we note that there exists a duality between this diamond channel coding problem and the Kaspi-Berger source coding problem.

Numerical simulations indicate that there is critical behaviour at the onset of black hole formation as in the classical theory, but with the difference that black holes form with a mass gap. 
0808.00950	Tunable pure spin currents in a triple-quantum-dot ring	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Weijiang Gong, Yisong Zheng, Tianquan Lv	Abstract:  Electron transport properties in a triple-quantum-dot ring with three terminals are theoretically studied. By introducing local Rashba spin-orbit interaction on an individual quantum dot, we calculate the charge and spin currents in one lead. We find that a pure spin current appears in the absence of a magnetic field. The polarization direction of the spin current can be inverted by altering the bias voltage. In addition, by tuning the magnetic field strength, the charge and spin currents reach their respective peaks alternately. 
0808.00951	A minimal set of invariants as a systematic approach to higher order gravity models	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Mustapha Ishak, Jacob Moldenhauer (The University of Texas at Dallas)    	Abstract:  Higher-order gravity models have been recently the subject of much attention in the context of cosmic acceleration. These models are derived by adding various curvature invariants to the Einstein-Hilbert action. Several studies showed that these models can have late-time self-acceleration and could, in some cases, fit various observational constraints. In view of the infinite spectrum of invariants that could be built from curvature tensors, we propose here a method based on minimal sets of independent invariants as a possible route for a systematic approach to these models. We explore a connection made between theorems on bases in invariants theory in relativity and higher-order cosmological models. A dynamical system analysis is performed and some models with accelerating attractors are discussed. The asymptotic behavior of the models is also studied using analytical calculations. 
0808.00952	Phenomenological model for two gap states in underdoped high-temperature superconductors and short-range antiferromagnetic correlation effect	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:T. Morinari	Abstract:  Assuming antiferromagnetic orbital correlations to model the pseudogap state in the underdoped high-temperature superconductors, we study how this correlation is distinguished from the d-wave superconductivity correlation with including the finite-range antiferromagnetic correlation effect. In spite of the fact that both correlations have the same d-wave symmetry, the contributions from each correlation is clearly distinguished in the spectral weight and the density of states. 
0808.00953	The applicability of causal dissipative hydrodynamics to relativistic heavy ion collisions	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Pasi Huovinen (1,2), Denes Molnar (2,3) ((1) Department of Physics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA, (2) Physics Department, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, (3) RIKEN BNL Research Center, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY, USA)    	Abstract:  We utilize nonequilibrium covariant transport theory to determine the region of validity of causal Israel-Stewart dissipative hydrodynamics (IS) and Navier-Stokes theory (NS) for relativistic heavy ion physics applications. A massless ideal gas with 2->2 interactions is considered in a 0+1D Bjorken scenario, appropriate for the early longitudinal expansion stage of the collision. In the scale invariant case of a constant shear viscosity to entropy density ratio eta/s ~ const, we find that Israel-Stewart theory is 10% accurate in calculating dissipative effects if initially the expansion timescale exceeds half the transport mean free path tau0/lambda0 > ~2. The same accuracy with Navier-Stokes requires three times larger tau0/lambda0 > ~6. For dynamics driven by a constant cross section, on the other hand, about 50% larger tau0/lambda0 > ~3 (IS) and ~9 (NS) are needed. For typical applications at RHIC energies s_{NN}**(1/2) ~ 100-200 GeV, these limits imply that even the Israel-Stewart approach becomes marginal when eta/s > ~0.15. In addition, we find that the 'naive' approximation to Israel-Stewart theory, which neglects products of gradients and dissipative quantities, has an even smaller range of applicability than Navier-Stokes. We also obtain analytic Israel-Stewart and Navier-Stokes solutions in 0+1D, and present further tests for numerical dissipative hydrodynamics codes in 1+1, 2+1, and 3+1D based on generalized conservation laws. 
0808.00954	Achievable rate regions for bi-directional relaying	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Sang Joon Kim, Natasha Devroye, Patrick Mitran, Vahid Tarokh	Abstract:  In a bi-directional relay channel, two nodes wish to exchange independent messages over a shared wireless half-duplex channel with the help of a relay. In this paper, we derive achievable rate regions for four new half-duplex protocols and compare these to four existing half-duplex protocols and outer bounds. In time, our protocols consist of either two or three phases. In the two phase protocols, both users simultaneously transmit during the first phase and the relay alone transmits during the second phase, while in the three phase protocol the two users sequentially transmit followed by a transmission from the relay. The relay may forward information in one of four manners; we outline existing Amplify and Forward (AF), Decode and Forward (DF) and Compress and Forward (CF) relaying schemes and introduce the novel Mixed Forward scheme. The latter is a combination of CF in one direction and DF in the other. We derive achievable rate regions for the CF and Mixed relaying schemes for the two and three phase protocols. In the last part of this work we provide a comprehensive treatment of 8 possible half-duplex bi-directional relaying protocols in Gaussian noise, obtaining their respective achievable rate regions, outer bounds, and their relative performance under different SNR and relay geometries. 
0808.00955	Unitary orbits in a full matrix algebra	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Gabriel Larotonda	Abstract:  The Hilbert manifold $Σ$ consisting of positive invertible (unitized) Hilbert-Schmidt operators has a rich structure and geometry. The geometry of unitary orbits $Ω\subset Σ$ is studied from the topological and metric viewpoints: we seek for conditions that ensure the existence of a smooth local structure for the set $Ω$, and we study the convexity of this set for the geodesic structures that arise when we give $Σ$ two Riemannian metrics. 
0808.00956	Unwrapping Closed Timelike Curves	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Sergei Slobodov	Abstract:  Closed timelike curves (CTCs) appear in many solutions of the Einstein equation, even with reasonable matter sources. These solutions appear to violate causality and so are considered problematic. Since CTCs reflect the global properties of a spacetime, one can attempt to change its topology, without changing its geometry, in such a way that the former CTCs are no longer closed in the new spacetime. This procedure is informally known as unwrapping. However, changes in global identifications tend to lead to local effects, and unwrapping is no exception, as it introduces a special kind of singularity, called quasi-regular. This "unwrapping" singularity is similar to the string singularities. We give two examples of unwrapping of essentially 2+1 dimensional spacetimes with CTCs, the Gott spacetime and the Godel universe. We show that the unwrapped Gott spacetime, while singular, is at least devoid of CTCs. In contrast, the unwrapped Godel spacetime still contains CTCs through every point. A "multiple unwrapping" procedure is devised to remove the remaining circular CTCs. We conclude that, based on the two spacetimes we investigated, CTCs appearing in the solutions of the Einstein equation are not simply a mathematical artifact of coordinate identifications, but are indeed a necessary consequence of General Relativity, provided only that we demand these solutions do not possess naked quasi-regular singularities. 
0808.00957	Quarkonium transport in thermal AdS/CFT	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Kevin Dusling, Johanna Erdmenger, Matthias Kaminski, Felix Rust, Derek Teaney, Clint Young	Abstract:  We consider a heavy meson moving slowly through high temperature non-abelian plasmas. Using a simple dipole effective Lagrangian, we calculate the in-medium mass shift and the drag coefficient of the meson in $\N=4$ Super Yang Mills theory at weak and strong coupling. As anticipated, in the large $N$ limit the mass shift is finite while the drag is suppressed by $1/N^2$ . After comparing results to perturbative QCD estimates (which are also calculated), we reach the conclusion that relative to weak coupling expectations the effect of strong coupling is to reduce the momentum diffusion rate and to {\it increase} the relaxation time by up to a factor of four. 
0808.00958	On the complete integrability and linearization of nonlinear ordinary differential equations - Part III: Coupled first order equations	Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)	Authors:V. K. Chandrasekar, M. Senthilvelan, M. Lakshmanan	Abstract:  Continuing our study on the complete integrability of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, in this paper we consider the integrability of a system of coupled first order nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of both autonomous and non-autonomous types. For this purpose, we modify the original Prelle-Singer procedure so as to apply it to both autonomous and non-autonomous systems of coupled first order ODEs. We briefly explain the method of finding integrals of motion (time independent as well as time dependent integrals) for two and three coupled first order ODEs by extending the Prelle-Singer(PS) method. From this we try to answer some of the open questions in the original PS method. We also identify integrable cases for the two dimensional Lotka-Volterra system and three-dimensional R$\ddot{o}$ssler system as well as other examples including non-autonomous systems in a straightforward way using this procedure. Finally, we develop a linearization procedure for coupled first order ODEs. 
0808.00959	The dual role of shear in large-scale dynamos	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Axel Brandenburg	Abstract:  The role of shear in alleviating catastrophic quenching by shedding small-scale magnetic helicity through fluxes along contours of constant shear is discussed. The level of quenching of the dynamo effect depends on the quenched value of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity. Earlier estimates that might have suffered from the force-free degeneracy of Beltrami fields are now confirmed for shear flows where this degeneracy is lifted. For a dynamo that is saturated near equipartition field strength those estimates result in a 5-fold decrease of the magnetic diffusivity as the magnetic Reynolds number based on the wavenumber of the energy-carrying eddies is increased from 2 to 600. Finally, the role of shear in driving turbulence and large-scale fields by the magneto-rotational instability is emphasized. New simulations are presented and the 3pi/4 phase shift between poloidal and toroidal fields is confirmed. It is suggested that this phase shift might be a useful diagnostic tool in identifying mean-field dynamo action in simulations and to distinguish this from other scenarios invoking magnetic buoyancy as a means to explain migration away from the midplane. 
0808.00960	Turbulent protostellar discs	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Axel Brandenburg	Abstract:  Aspects of turbulence in protostellar accretion discs are being reviewed. The emergence of dead zones due to poor ionization and alternatives to the magneto-rotational instability are discussed. The coupling between dust and gas in protostellar accretion discs is explained and turbulent drag is compared with laminar drag in the Stokes and Epstein regimes. Finally, the significance of magnetic field generation in turbulent discs is emphasized in connection with driving outflows and with star-disc coupling. 
0808.00961	Large-scale dynamos at low magnetic Prandtl numbers	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Axel Brandenburg	Abstract:  Using direct simulations of hydromagnetic turbulence driven by random polarized waves it is shown that dynamo action is possible over a wide range of magnetic Prandtl numbers from 10^-3 to 1. Triply periodic boundary conditions are being used. In the final saturated state the resulting magnetic field has a large-scale component of Beltrami type. For the kinematic phase, growth rates have been determined for magnetic Prandtl numbers between 0.01 and 1, but only the case with the smallest magnetic Prandtl number shows large-scale magnetic fields. It is less organized than in the nonlinear stage. For small magnetic Prandtl numbers the growth rates are comparable to those calculated from an alpha squared mean-field dynamo. In the linear regime the magnetic helicity spectrum has a short inertial range compatible with a -5/3 power law, while in the nonlinear regime it is the current helicity whose spectrum may be compatible with such a law. In the saturated case, the spectral magnetic energy in the inertial range is in slight excess over the spectral kinetic energy, although for small magnetic Prandtl numbers the magnetic energy spectrum reaches its resistive cut off wavenumber more quickly. The viscous energy dissipation declines with the square root of the magnetic Prandtl number, which implies that most of the energy is dissipated via Joule heat. 
0808.00962	Verification of Peterson's Algorithm for Leader Election in a Unidirectional Asynchronous Ring Using NuSMV	Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)	Authors:Amin Ansari	Abstract:  The finite intrinsic nature of the most distributed algorithms gives us this ability to use model checking tools for verification of this type of algorithms. In this paper, I attempt to use NuSMV as a model checking tool for verifying necessary properties of Peterson's algorithm for leader election problem in a unidirectional asynchronous ring topology. Peterson's algorithm for an asynchronous ring supposes that each node in the ring has a unique ID and also a queue for dealing with storage problem. By considering that the queue can have any combination of values, a constructed model for a ring with only four nodes will have more than a billion states. Although it seems that model checking is not a feasible approach for this problem, I attempt to use several effective limiting assumptions for hiring formal model checking approach without losing the correct functionality of the Peterson's algorithm. These enforced limiting assumptions target the degree of freedom in the model checking process and significantly decrease the CPU time, memory usage and the total number of page faults. By deploying these limitations, the number of nodes can be increased from four to eight in the model checking process with NuSMV. 
0808.00963	A parallel algorithm for the enumeration of benzenoid hydrocarbons	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Iwan Jensen	Abstract:  We present an improved parallel algorithm for the enumeration of fixed benzenoids B_h containing h hexagonal cells. We can thus extend the enumeration of B_h from the previous best h=35 up to h=50. Analysis of the associated generating function confirms to a very high degree of certainty that $B_h \sim A κ^h /h$ and we estimate that the growth constant $κ= 5.161930154(8)$ and the amplitude $A=0.2808499(1)$. 
0808.00964	On the Euler Numbers and its Applications	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Taekyun Kim	Abstract:  Recently the new q-Euler numbers are defined.

0808.00965	Pyrophosphate Groups in Liquid Crystalline Phases of the DNA	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:V.L. Golo, E.I. Kats, S.A. Kuznetsova, Yu.S. Volkov	Abstract:  We study electrostatic interaction between molecules of the DNA in which a number of phosphate groups of the sugar-phosphate backbone are exchanged for the pyrophosphate ones. We employ a model in which the DNA is considered as a one-dimensional lattice of dipoles and charges corresponding to base pairs and (pyro)phosphate groups, respectively. The interaction between molecules of the DNA is described by a pair potential $U$ of electrostatic forces between the two sets of dipoles and charges belonging to respective lattices describing the molecules. Minima of potential $U$ indicate orientational ordering of the molecules and thus liquid crystalline phases of the DNA. We use numerical methods for finding the set of minima in conjunction with symmetries verified by potential $U$. The symmetries form a noncommutative group of 8-th order, ${\cal S}$. Using the group ${\cal S}$ we suggest a classification of liquid crystalline phases of the DNA, which allows of several cholesteric phases, that is polymorphism. Pyrophosphate forms of the DNA could clarify the part played by charges in its liquid crystalline phases, and make for experimental research, important for nano-technological and bio-medical applications. 
0808.00966	Extinction of impurity resonances in large-gap regions of inhomogeneous d-wave superconductors	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Brian M. Andersen, S. Graser, P. J. Hirschfeld	Abstract:  Impurity resonances observed by scanning tunneling spectroscopy in the superconducting state have been used to deduce properties of the underlying pure state. Here we study a longstanding puzzle associated with these measurements, the apparent extinction of these resonances for Ni and Zn impurities in large-gap regions of the inhomogeneous BSCCO superconductor. We calculate the effect of order parameter and hopping suppression near the impurity site, and find that these two effects are sufficient to explain the missing resonances in the case of Ni. There are several possible scenarios for the extinction of the Zn resonances, which we discuss in turn; in addition, we propose measurements which could distinguish among them. 
0808.00967	The sparsity and bias of the Lasso selection in high-dimensional linear regression	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Cun-Hui Zhang, Jian Huang	Abstract:  Meinshausen and Buhlmann [Ann. Statist. 34 (2006) 1436--1462] showed that, for neighborhood selection in Gaussian graphical models, under a neighborhood stability condition, the LASSO is consistent, even when the number of variables is of greater order than the sample size. Zhao and Yu [(2006) J. Machine Learning Research 7 2541--2567] formalized the neighborhood stability condition in the context of linear regression as a strong irrepresentable condition. That paper showed that under this condition, the LASSO selects exactly the set of nonzero regression coefficients, provided that these coefficients are bounded away from zero at a certain rate. In this paper, the regression coefficients outside an ideal model are assumed to be small, but not necessarily zero. Under a sparse Riesz condition on the correlation of design variables, we prove that the LASSO selects a model of the correct order of dimensionality, controls the bias of the selected model at a level determined by the contributions of small regression coefficients and threshold bias, and selects all coefficients of greater order than the bias of the selected model. Moreover, as a consequence of this rate consistency of the LASSO in model selection, it is proved that the sum of error squares for the mean response and the $\ell_α$-loss for the regression coefficients converge at the best possible rates under the given conditions. An interesting aspect of our results is that the logarithm of the number of variables can be of the same order as the sample size for certain random dependent designs. 
0808.00968	On the complete integrability and linearization of nonlinear ordinary differential equations - Part IV: Coupled second order equations	Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)	Authors:V. K. Chandrasekar, M. Senthilvelan, M. Lakshmanan	Abstract:  Coupled second order nonlinear differential equations are of fundamental importance in dynamics. In this part of our study on the integrability and linearization of nonlinear ordinary differential equations we focus our attention on the method of deriving general solution of two coupled second order nonlinear ordinary differential equations through the extended Prelle-Singer procedure. We describe a procedure to obtain integrating factors and required number of integrals of motion so that the general solution follows straightforwardly from these integrals. Our method tackles both isotropic and non-isotropic cases in a systematic way. In addition to the above, we introduce a new method of transforming coupled second order nonlinear ODEs into uncoupled ones. We illustrate the theory with potentially important examples. 
0808.00969	On the complete integrability and linearization of nonlinear ordinary differential equations - Part V: Linearization of coupled second order equations	Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)	Authors:V. K. Chandrasekar, M. Senthilvelan, M. Lakshmanan	Abstract:  Linearization of coupled second order nonlinear ordinary differential equations (SNODEs) is one of the open and challenging problems in the theory of differential equations. In this paper we describe a simple and straightforward method to derive linearizing transformations for a class of two coupled SNODEs. Our procedure gives several new types of linearizing transformations of both invertible and non-invertible kinds. In both the cases we provide algorithms to derive the general solution of the given SNODE. We illustrate the theory with potentially important examples.

0808.00971	Dalitz Plot Analysis of D_s+ -> pi+ pi- pi+	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  A Dalitz plot analysis of approximately 13,000 Ds+ decays to pi+pi-pi+ has been performed. The analysis uses a 384 fb-1 data sample recorded by the BaBar detector at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e+e- storage ring running at center of mass energies near 10.6 GeV. Amplitudes and phases of the intermediate resonances which contribute to this final state are measured. A high precision measurement of the ratio of branching fractions is performed: BR(Ds+ -> pi+pi-pi+)/BR(Ds+ -> K+ K- pi+)=0.199 +/- 0.004 +/- 0.009. Using a model-independent partial wave analysis, the amplitude and phase of the S-wave have been measured.

0808.00973	Text Modeling using Unsupervised Topic Models and Concept Hierarchies	Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)	Authors:Chaitanya Chemudugunta, Padhraic Smyth, Mark Steyvers	Abstract:  Statistical topic models provide a general data-driven framework for automated discovery of high-level knowledge from large collections of text documents. While topic models can potentially discover a broad range of themes in a data set, the interpretability of the learned topics is not always ideal. Human-defined concepts, on the other hand, tend to be semantically richer due to careful selection of words to define concepts but they tend not to cover the themes in a data set exhaustively. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework to combine a hierarchy of human-defined semantic concepts with statistical topic models to seek the best of both worlds. Experimental results using two different sources of concept hierarchies and two collections of text documents indicate that this combination leads to systematic improvements in the quality of the associated language models as well as enabling new techniques for inferring and visualizing the semantics of a document.

Oles	Abstract:  Superconductivity in Mo3Sb7 is analyzed using the combined electronic structure and phonon calculations, and the electron--phonon coupling constant λ_{ph}=0.54 is determined from first principles. This value explains the experimental value of the superconducting critical temperature T_c=2.2 K. The possible influence of spin fluctuations and spin gap on the superconductivity in Mo3Sb7 is discussed, and electron--paramagnon interaction is found to be weak. 
0808.00975	Magnetocaloric properties of Fe_{2-x}T_xP (T = Ru and Rh) from electronic structure calculations and magnetisation measurements	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:B. Wiendlocha, J. Tobola, S. Kaprzyk, R. Zach, E. K. Hlil, D. Fruchart	Abstract:  An analysis of the magnetocaloric properties of the pure and substituted Fe2P compounds is made based on KKR-CPA electronic structure calculations and magnetisation M(H,T) measurements. The computed electronic densities of states and magnetic moments are used to calculate both the values of the electronic and magnetic entropies, which fairly agree with the experimental findings. To enlighten the magnetic properties above Curie temperature, the paramagnetic state behaviours are simulated using the disordered local moments (DLM) concept. The KKR-CPA computations show, that in Fe2P, the Fe magnetic moment of the (3f) site disappears in the DLM state, while the moment of the (3g) site is only little lowered, comparison made with the low temperature ferromagnetic state. 
0808.00976	Statistics of extremes by oracle estimation	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Ion Grama, Vladimir Spokoiny	Abstract:  We use the fitted Pareto law to construct an accompanying approximation of the excess distribution function. A selection rule of the location of the excess distribution function is proposed based on a stagewise lack-of-fit testing procedure. Our main result is an oracle type inequality for the Kullback--Leibler loss. 
0808.00977	Dimension reduction based on constrained canonical correlation and variable filtering	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Jianhui Zhou, Xuming He	Abstract:  The ``curse of dimensionality'' has remained a challenge for high-dimensional data analysis in statistics. The sliced inverse regression (SIR) and canonical correlation (CANCOR) methods aim to reduce the dimensionality of data by replacing the explanatory variables with a small number of composite directions without losing much information. However, the estimated composite directions generally involve all of the variables, making their interpretation difficult. To simplify the direction estimates, Ni, Cook and Tsai [Biometrika 92 (2005) 242--247] proposed the shrinkage sliced inverse regression (SSIR) based on SIR. In this paper, we propose the constrained canonical correlation ($C^3$) method based on CANCOR, followed by a simple variable filtering method. As a result, each composite direction consists of a subset of the variables for interpretability as well as predictive power. The proposed method aims to identify simple structures without sacrificing the desirable properties of the unconstrained CANCOR estimates. The simulation studies demonstrate the performance advantage of the proposed $C^3$ method over the SSIR method. We also use the proposed method in two examples for illustration.

0808.00979	Neutron spectroscopy and magnetic relaxation of the Mn$_6$ nanomagnets	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:S. Carretta, T. Guidi, P. Santini, G. Amoretti, O. Pieper, B. Lake, J. van Slageren, F. El Hallak, W. Wernsdorfer, H. Mutka, M. Russina, C.J. Milios, E. K. Brechin	Abstract:  Inelastic neutron scattering has been used to determine the microscopic Hamiltonian describing two high-spin variants of the high-anisotropy Mn$_6$ nanomagnet. The energy spectrum of both systems is characterized by the presence of several excited total-spin multiplets partially overlapping the S=12 ground multiplet. This implies that the relaxation processes of these molecules are different from those occurring in prototype giant-spin nanomagnets. In particular, we show that both the height of the energy barrier and resonant tunnelling processes are greatly influenced by low-lying excited total-spin multiplets. 
0808.00980	On Complexity of Minimum Leaf Out-branching Problem	Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)	Authors:Peter Dankelmann, Gregory Gutin, Eun Jung Kim	Abstract:  Given a digraph $D$, the Minimum Leaf Out-Branching problem (MinLOB) is the problem of finding in $D$ an out-branching with the minimum possible number of leaves, i.e., vertices of out-degree 0. Gutin, Razgon and Kim (2008) proved that MinLOB is polynomial time solvable for acyclic digraphs which are exactly the digraphs of directed path-width (DAG-width, directed tree-width, respectively) 0. We investigate how much one can extend this polynomiality result. We prove that already for digraphs of directed path-width (directed tree-width, DAG-width, respectively) 1, MinLOB is NP-hard. On the other hand, we show that for digraphs of restricted directed tree-width (directed path-width, DAG-width, respectively) and a fixed integer $k$, the problem of checking whether there is an out-branching with at most $k$ leaves is polynomial time solvable. 
0808.00981	"Equilibrium" states of non equilibrium system	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Bohdan Lev	Abstract:  A possible approach to description of the non equilibrium system has been proposed. Based on the Fokker-Plank equation in term of energy for non equilibrium distribution function of macroscopical system was obtained the stationary solution which can be interpreted as the equilibrium distribution function for new energetic state. The proposed approach takes into account the possible motion between different states of system, induced by dissipation of energy and influence of environment which dependence on energy of the system. A non-linear model, which describe possible stationary state of system with different processes in it, has been described.

We will derive this using $q$-orthogonal polynomials with respect to generalized Freud weights: their recurrence coefficients will obey this $q$-Painlevé equation (up to a simple transformation). We will show a stable method of computing a special solution which gives the recurrence coefficients. We establish a connection with $α-q-P_V$. 
0808.00983	Density of states near a vortex core in ferromagnetic superconductors: Application to STM measurements	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Jacob Linder, Takehito Yokoyama, Asle Sudbø	Abstract:  We investigate numerically the local density of states (LDOS) in the vicinity of a vortex core in a ferromagnetic superconductor. Specifically, we investigate how the LDOS is affected by the relative weight of the spin bands in terms of the superconducting pairing, and we also examine the effect of different pairing symmetries for the superconducting order parameter. Our findings are directly related to scanning tunneling microscopy measurements and may thus be highly useful to clarify details of the superconducting pairing in recently discovered ferromagnetic superconductors. 
0808.00984	Fidelity induced distance measures for quantum states	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Zhihao Ma, Fu-Lin Zhang, Jing-Ling Chen	Abstract:  Fidelity plays an important role in quantum information theory. In this letter, we introduce new metric of quantum states induced by fidelity, and connect it with the well-known trace metric, Sine metric and Bures metric for the qubit case. The metric character is also presented for the qudit (i.e., $d$-dimensional system) case. The CPT contractive property and joint convex property of the metric are also studied. 
0808.00985	Fence methods for mixed model selection	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Jiming Jiang, J. Sunil Rao, Zhonghua Gu, Thuan Nguyen	Abstract:  Many model search strategies involve trading off model fit with model complexity in a penalized goodness of fit measure. Asymptotic properties for these types of procedures in settings like linear regression and ARMA time series have been studied, but these do not naturally extend to nonstandard situations such as mixed effects models, where simple definition of the sample size is not meaningful. This paper introduces a new class of strategies, known as fence methods, for mixed model selection, which includes linear and generalized linear mixed models. The idea involves a procedure to isolate a subgroup of what are known as correct models (of which the optimal model is a member). This is accomplished by constructing a statistical fence, or barrier, to carefully eliminate incorrect models. Once the fence is constructed, the optimal model is selected from among those within the fence according to a criterion which can be made flexible. In addition, we propose two variations of the fence. The first is a stepwise procedure to handle situations of many predictors; the second is an adaptive approach for choosing a tuning constant. We give sufficient conditions for consistency of fence and its variations, a desirable property for a good model selection procedure. The methods are illustrated through simulation studies and real data analysis. 
0808.00986	Clump morphology and evolution in MHD simulations of molecular cloud formation	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Robi Banerjee, Enrique Vazquez-Semadeni, Patrick Hennebelle, Ralf Klessen	Abstract:  Abridged: We study the properties of clumps formed in three-dimensional weakly magnetized magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of converging flows in the thermally bistable, warm neutral medium (WNM). We find that: (1) Similarly to the situation in the classical two-phase medium, cold, dense clumps form through dynamically-triggered thermal instability in the compressed layer between the convergent flows, and are often characterised by a sharp density jump at their boundaries though not always. (2) However, the clumps are bounded by phase-transition fronts rather than by contact discontinuities, and thus they grow in size and mass mainly by accretion of WNM material through their boundaries. (3) The clump boundaries generally consist of thin layers of thermally unstable gas, but these layers are often widened by the turbulence, and penetrate deep into the clumps. (4) The clumps are approximately in both ram and thermal pressure balance with their surroundings, a condition which causes their internal Mach numbers to be comparable to the bulk Mach number of the colliding WNM flows. (5) The clumps typically have mean temperatures 20 < T < 50 K, corresponding to the wide range of densities they contain (20 < n < 5000 pcc) under a nearly-isothermal equation of state. (6) The turbulent ram pressure fluctuations of the WNM induce density fluctuations that then serve as seeds for local gravitational collapse within the clumps. (7) The velocity and magnetic fields tend to be aligned with each other within the clumps, although both are significantly fluctuating, suggesting that the velocity tends to stretch and align the magnetic field with it. (8) The typical mean field strength in the clumps is a few times larger than that in the WNM. (9) The magnetic field strength has a mean value of B ~ 6 mu G ... 
0808.00987	A new graph perspective on max-min fairness in Gaussian parallel channels	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Marcin Wiczanowski, Holger Boche	Abstract:  In this work we are concerned with the problem of achieving max-min fairness in Gaussian parallel channels with respect to a general performance function, including channel capacity or decoding reliability as special cases. As our central results, we characterize the laws which determine the value of the achievable max-min fair performance as a function of channel sharing policy and power allocation (to channels and users). In particular, we show that the max-min fair performance behaves as a specialized version of the Lovasz function, or Delsarte bound, of a certain graph induced by channel sharing combinatorics. We also prove that, in addition to such graph, merely a certain 2-norm distance dependent on the allowable power allocations and used performance functions, is sufficient for the characterization of max-min fair performance up to some candidate interval. Our results show also a specific role played by odd cycles in the graph induced by the channel sharing policy and we present an interesting relation between max-min fairness in parallel channels and optimal throughput in an associated interference channel. 
0808.00988	Derived Kodaira Spencer map, Cosection lemma, and semiregularity	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Huai-Liang Chang	Abstract:  The cosection lemma proved by J. Li and Y.H. Kiem said the intrinsic normal cone lies inside the kernel of any cosection of the obstruction sheaf when the moduli has a perfect obstruction theory. With a definition of higher tangent vectors of a scheme at a point, and a construction of the derived Kodaira Spencer map by K. Behrend and B. Fantechi, we prove a derived version of cosection lemma without perfect obstruction theory condition. As an application we give a short proof of the Kodaira's Principle \textit{ambient cohomology annihilates obstruction} (semiregularity), assuming the existence of locall universal family. 
0808.00989	Semiparametric detection of significant activation for brain fMRI	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Chunming Zhang, Tao Yu	Abstract:  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) aims to locate activated regions in human brains when specific tasks are performed. The conventional tool for analyzing fMRI data applies some variant of the linear model, which is restrictive in modeling assumptions. To yield more accurate prediction of the time-course behavior of neuronal responses, the semiparametric inference for the underlying hemodynamic response function is developed to identify significantly activated voxels. Under mild regularity conditions, we demonstrate that a class of the proposed semiparametric test statistics, based on the local linear estimation technique, follow $χ^2$ distributions under null hypotheses for a number of useful hypotheses. Furthermore, the asymptotic power functions of the constructed tests are derived under the fixed and contiguous alternatives. Simulation evaluations and real fMRI data application suggest that the semiparametric inference procedure provides more efficient detection of activated brain areas than the popular imaging analysis tools AFNI and FSL. 
0808.00990	Effective Scenario of Loop Quantum Cosmology	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:You Ding, Yongge Ma, Jinsong Yang	Abstract:  Semiclassical states in isotropic loop quantum cosmology are employed to show that the improved dynamics has the correct classical limit. The effective Hamiltonian for the quantum cosmological model with a massless scalar field is thus obtained, which incorporates also the next to leading order quantum corrections. The possibility that the higher order correction terms may lead to significant departure from the leading order effective scenario is revealed. If the semiclassicality of the model is maintained in the large scale limit, there are great possibilities for $k=0$ Friedmann expanding universe to undergo a collapse in the future due to the quantum gravity effect. Thus the quantum bounce and collapse may contribute a cyclic universe in the new scenario. 
0808.00991	Ferro-electric phase transition in a polar liquid and the nature of λ-transition in supercooled water	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:P.O. Fedichev, L.I. Menshikov	Abstract:  We develop a series of approximations to calculate free energy of a polar liquid. We show that long range nature of dipole interactions between the molecules leads to para-electric state instability at low temperatures and to a second-order phase transition. We establish the transition temperature, T_{c}, both within mean field and ring diagrams approximation and show that the ferro-electric transition may play an important role explaining a number of peculiar properties of supercooled water, such as weak singularity of dielectric constant as well as to a large extent anomalous density behavior. Finally we discuss the role of fluctuations, shorter range forces and establish connections with phenomenological models of polar liquids. 
0808.00992	On the string coupling in a class of stringy orbifold GUTs	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Ben Dundee, Stuart Raby	Abstract:  In this short note, we examine the relationship between the string coupling constant, $\gstring{}$, and the grand unified gauge coupling constant, $\alphagut{}$, in a highly successful class of models based on anisotropic orbifold compactifications of the weakly coupled heterotic string. These models represent a stringy embedding of SU(6) gauge-Higgs unification in a five dimensional orbifold GUT. We find that the requirement that the theory be perturbative provides a non-trivial constraint on these models. Interestingly, there is a correlation between the proton decay rate (due to dimension six operators) and the string coupling constant. Finally, we make some comments concerning the extension of these models to the six (and higher) dimensional case. 
0808.00993	Indications of Universal Excess Fluctuations in Nonequilibrium Systems	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Tatsuro Yuge, Akira Shimizu	Abstract:  The fluctuation in electric current in nonequilibrium steady states is investigated by molecular dynamics simulation of macroscopically uniform conductors. At low frequencies, appropriate decomposition of the spectral intensity of current into thermal and excess fluctuations provides a simple picture of excess fluctuations behaving as shot noise. This indicates that the fluctuation-dissipation relation may be violated in a universal manner by the appearance of shot noise for a wide range of systems with particle or momentum transport. 
0808.00994	Scaling properties of critical bubble of homogeneous nucleation in stretched fluid of square-gradient density-functional model with triple-parabolic free energy	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Masao Iwamatsu	Abstract:  The square-gradient density-functional model with triple-parabolic free energy is used to study homogeneous bubble nucleation in a stretched liquid to check the scaling rule for the work of formation of the critical bubble as a function of scaled undersaturation $Δμ/Δμ_{\rm spin}$, the difference in chemical potential $Δμ$ between the bulk undersaturated and saturated liquid divided by $Δμ_{\rm spin}$ between the liquid spinodal and saturated liquid. In contrast to our study, a similar density-functional study for a Lennard-Jones liquid by Shen and Debenedetti [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 114}, 4149 (2001)] found that not only the work of formation but other various quantities related to the critical bubble show the scaling rule, however, we found virtually no scaling relationships in our model near the coexistence. Although some quantities show almost perfect scaling relations near the spinodal, the work of formation divided by the value deduced from the classical nucleation theory shows no scaling in this model even though it correctly vanishes at the spinodal. Furthermore, the critical bubble does not show any anomaly near the spinodal as predicted many years ago. In particular, our model does not show diverging interfacial width at the spinodal, which is due to the fact that compressibility remains finite until the spinodal is reached in our parabolic models. 
0808.00995	Normal Forms for Semilinear Quantum Harmonic Oscillators	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Benoit Grebert (LMJL), Rafik Imekraz (LMJL), Eric Paturel (LMJL)    	Abstract:  We consider the semilinear harmonic oscillator $$iψ_t=(-Δ+\va{x}^{2} +M)ψ+\partial_2 g(ψ,\bar ψ), \quad x\in \R^d, t\in \R$$ where $M$ is a Hermite multiplier and $g$ a smooth function globally of order 3 at least. We prove that such a Hamiltonian equation admits, in a neighborhood of the origin, a Birkhoff normal form at any order and that, under generic conditions on $M$ related to the non resonance of the linear part, this normal form is integrable when $d=1$ and gives rise to simple (in particular bounded) dynamics when $d\geq 2$. As a consequence we prove the almost global existence for solutions of the above equation with small Cauchy data. Furthermore we control the high Sobolev norms of these solutions. 
0808.00996	Interplay between 3d and 4f magnetism in CeCoPO	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:C. Krellner, U. Burkhardt, C. Geibel	Abstract:  The ground state properties of CeCoPO, a homologue of the new high temperature superconductors RFePnO1-xFx, were studied by means of susceptibility, specific heat, and resistivity measurements on polycrystals. The observation of a well defined Curie-Weiss behavior above 230K with mu_eff=2.9mu_B and a ferromagnetic ordering below T_C=75K is similar to what was observed in LaCoPO and points to magnetism of the Co-3d electrons. However, the Ce-ions are on the border to magnetism with a Kondo scale of T_K~40K and show an enhanced Sommerfeld-coefficient of γ~200mJ/molK^2. 
0808.00997	The gravitational field of a light wave	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:J.W. van Holten	Abstract:  According to the classical Einstein-Maxwell theory of gravity and electromagnetism, a light-wave traveling in empty space-time is accompanied by a gravitational field of the pp-type. Therefore point masses are scattered by a light wave, even if they carry no electric or magnetic charge, or dipole moment. In this paper I present the explicit form of the metric and curvature for both circularly and linearly polarized light, and discuss the geodesic motion of test masses. This is followed by a discussion of classical scattering of point particles by the gravitational field associated with a circularly polarized electromagnetic block wave. A generalization to a quantum theory of particles in the background of these classical wave fields is presented in terms of the covariant Klein-Gordon equation. I derive the energy spectrum of quantum particles in the specific case of the circularly polarized block wave. Finally, a few general remarks on the extension to a quantum light wave are presented. 
0808.00998	Supersolid behavior of nonlinear light	Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)	Authors:Albert Ferrando, Miguel Ángel García-March, Mario Zacarés	Abstract:  We present a formal demonstration that light can simultaneously exhibit a superfluid behavior and spatial long-range order when propagating in a photonic crystal with self-focussing nonlinearity. In this way, light presents the distinguishing features of matter in a "supersolid" phase. We show that this supersolid phase provides the stability conditions for nonlinear Bloch waves and, at the same time, permits the existence of topological solitons or defects for the envelope of these waves. We use a condensed matter analysis instead of a standard nonlinear optics approach and provide numerical evidence of these theoretical findings. 
0808.00999	On finite groups acting on acyclic low-dimensional manifolds	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Alessandra Guazzi, Mattia Mecchia, Bruno Zimmermann	Abstract:  We consider finite groups which admit a faithful, smooth action on an acyclic manifold of dimension three, four or five (e.g. euclidean space). Our first main result states that a finite group acting on an acyclic 3- or 4-manifold is isomorphic to a subgroup of the orthogonal group O(3) or O(4), respectively. The analogue remains open in dimension five (where it is not true for arbitrary continuous actions, however). We prove that the only finite nonabelian simple groups admitting a smooth action on an acyclic 5-manifold are the alternating groups A_5 and A_6, and deduce from this a short list of finite groups, closely related to the finite subgroups of SO(5), which are the candidates for orientation-preserving actions on acyclic 5-manifolds.

0808.01001	Happy places or happy people? A multi-level modelling approach to the analysis of happiness and well-being	Applications (stat.AP)	Authors:Dimitris Ballas, Mark Tranmer	Abstract:  This paper aims to enhance our understanding of substantive questions regarding self-reported happiness and well-being through the specification and use of multi-level models. To date, there have been numerous quantitative research studies of the happiness of individuals, based on single-level regression models, where typically a happiness index is related to a set of explanatory variables. There are also several single-level studies comparing aggregate happiness levels between countries. Nevertheless, there have been very few studies that attempt to simultaneously take into account variations in happiness and well-being at several different levels, such as individual, household, and area. Here, multilevel models are used with data from the British Household Panel Survey to assess the nature and extent of variations in happiness and well-being to determine the relative importance of the area (district, region), household and individual characteristics on these outcomes. Moreover, having taken into account the characteristics at these different levels in the multilevel models, the paper shows how it is possible to identify any areas that are associated with especially positive or negative feelings of happiness and well-being.

Ikhdair, Ramazan Sever	Abstract:  The Dirac equation is solved approximately for the Hulthen potential with the pseudospin symmetry for any spin-orbit quantum number $κ$ in the position-dependent mass background. Solutions are obtained reducing the Dirac equation into a Schrödinger-like differential equation by using an appropriate coordinate transformation. The Nikiforov-Uvarov method is used in the calculations to get energy eigenvalues and the corresponding wave functions. 
0808.01003	Study of Charm Fragmentation into D^{*\pm} Mesons in Deep-Inelastic Scattering at HERA	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:H1 Collaboration	Abstract:  The process of charm quark fragmentation is studied using $D^{*\pm}$ meson production in deep-inelastic scattering as measured by the H1 detector at HERA. Two different regions of phase space are investigated defined by the presence or absence of a jet containing the $D^{*\pm}$ meson in the event. The parameters of fragmentation functions are extracted for QCD models based on leading order matrix elements and DGLAP or CCFM evolution of partons together with string fragmentation and particle decays. Additionally, they are determined for a next-to-leading order QCD calculation in the fixed flavour number scheme using the independent fragmentation of charm quarks to $D^{*\pm}$ mesons. 
0808.01004	Left-right asymmetry in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering process	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Jun She, Yajun Mao, Bo-Qiang Ma	Abstract:  We analyze the left-right asymmetry of pion production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) process of unpolarized charged lepton on transversely polarized nucleon target. Unlike available treatments, in which some specific weighting functions are multiplied to separate theoretically motivated quantities, we do not introduce any weighting function following the analyzing method by the E704 experiment. The advantage is that this basic observable is free of any theoretical bias, although we can perform the calculation under the current theoretical framework. We present numerical calculations at both HERMES kinematics for the proton target and JLab kinematics for the neutron target. We find that with the current theoretical understanding, Sivers effect plays a key role in our analysis. 
0808.01005	Theory of time-resolved optical spectroscopy on correlated electron systems	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Martin Eckstein, Marcus Kollar	Abstract:  The real-time dynamics of interacting electrons out of equilibrium contains detailed microscopic information about electronically correlated materials, which can be read out with time-resolved optical spectroscopy. The reflectivity that is typically measured in pump-probe experiments is related to the nonequilibrium optical conductivity. We show how to express this quantity in terms of real-time Green functions using dynamical mean-field theory. As an application we study the electrical response of the Falicov-Kimball model during the ultrafast buildup of the gapped phase at large interaction. 
0808.01006	Infinite potential well with a sinusoidal bottom	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:A. D. Alhaidari, H. Bahlouli	Abstract:  We construct a tridiagonal matrix representation of the wave operator that maps the wave equation into a three-term recursion relation for the expansion coefficients of the wavefunction. Finding a solution of the recursion relation is equivalent to solving the original problem. Consequently, a larger class of solvable potentials is obtained. The usual diagonal representation constraint results in a reduction to the conventional class of solvable potentials. To exhibit the power of this approach, we give an exact solution for the infinite potential well with sinusoidal bottom. 
0808.01007	On Quantum Capacity of Compound Channels	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:I. Bjelakovic, H. Boche, J. Noetzel	Abstract:  In this paper we address the issue of universal or robust communication over quantum channels. Specifically, we consider memoryless communication scenario with channel uncertainty which is an analog of compound channel in classical information theory. We determine the quantum capacity of finite compound channels and arbitrary compound channels with informed decoder. Our approach in the finite case is based on the observation that perfect channel knowledge at the decoder does not increase the capacity of finite quantum compound channels. As a consequence we obtain coding theorem for finite quantum averaged channels, the simplest class of channels with long-term memory. The extension of these results to quantum compound channels with uninformed encoder and decoder, and infinitely many constituents remains an open problem. 
0808.01008	Symmetry Classes in Graphene Quantum Dots: Universal Spectral Statistics, Weak Localization, and Conductance Fluctuations	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:J. Wurm, A. Rycerz, I. Adagideli, M. Wimmer, K. Richter, H.U. Baranger	Abstract:  We study the symmetry classes of graphene quantum dots, both open and closed, through the conductance and energy level statistics. For abrupt termination of the lattice, these properties are well described by the standard orthogonal and unitary ensembles. However, for smooth mass confinement, special time-reversal symmetries associated with the sublattice and valley degrees of freedom are critical: they lead to block diagonal Hamiltonians and scattering matrices with blocks belonging to the unitary symmetry class even at zero magnetic field. While the effect of this structure is clearly seen in the conductance of open dots, it is suppressed in the spectral statistics of closed dots, because the intervalley scattering time is shorter than the time required to resolve a level spacing in the closed systems but longer than the escape time of the open systems. 
0808.01009	Incommensurate spin density modulation in a copper-oxide chain compound with commensurate charge order	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:M. Raichle, M. Reehuis, G. André, L. Capogna, M. Sofin, M. Jansen, B. Keimer	Abstract:  Neutron diffraction has been used to determine the magnetic structure of Na$_8$Cu$_5$O$_{10}$, a stoichiometric compound containing chains based on edge-sharing CuO$_4$ plaquettes. The chains are doped with 2/5 hole per Cu site and exhibit long-range commensurate charge order with an onset well above room temperature. Below $T_N = 23$ K, the neutron data indicate long-range collinear magnetic order with a spin density modulation whose propagation vector is commensurate along and incommensurate perpendicular to the chains. Competing interchain exchange interactions are discussed as a possible origin of the incommensurate magnetic order. 
0808.01010	Confidence bands in nonparametric time series regression	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Zhibiao Zhao, Wei Biao Wu	Abstract:  We consider nonparametric estimation of mean regression and conditional variance (or volatility) functions in nonlinear stochastic regression models. Simultaneous confidence bands are constructed and the coverage probabilities are shown to be asymptotically correct. The imposed dependence structure allows applications in many linear and nonlinear auto-regressive processes. The results are applied to the S&P 500 Index data.

0808.01012	One-step sparse estimates in nonconcave penalized likelihood models	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Hui Zou, Runze Li	Abstract:  Fan and Li propose a family of variable selection methods via penalized likelihood using concave penalty functions. The nonconcave penalized likelihood estimators enjoy the oracle properties, but maximizing the penalized likelihood function is computationally challenging, because the objective function is nondifferentiable and nonconcave. In this article, we propose a new unified algorithm based on the local linear approximation (LLA) for maximizing the penalized likelihood for a broad class of concave penalty functions. Convergence and other theoretical properties of the LLA algorithm are established. A distinguished feature of the LLA algorithm is that at each LLA step, the LLA estimator can naturally adopt a sparse representation. Thus, we suggest using the one-step LLA estimator from the LLA algorithm as the final estimates. Statistically, we show that if the regularization parameter is appropriately chosen, the one-step LLA estimates enjoy the oracle properties with good initial estimators. Computationally, the one-step LLA estimation methods dramatically reduce the computational cost in maximizing the nonconcave penalized likelihood. We conduct some Monte Carlo simulation to assess the finite sample performance of the one-step sparse estimation methods. The results are very encouraging.

0808.01014	What is measured in a photoluminescence experiment on Quantum dots embedded in a large Purcell factor microcavity?	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Bruno Gayral, Jean-Michel Gerard	Abstract:  It is usually assumed that when performing a photoluminescence experiment on a microcavity containing an inhomogeneously broadened quantum dots ensemble, the cavity mode appears as a positive peak with a linewidth that reflects the mode quality factor Q. We show in this article that this conclusion is in general not true, and that the measured mode linewidth depends strongly on the excitation power for microcavities having large Purcell factors. We analyze theoretically this effect in the case of the micropillar cavity and we show that the same microcavity can give rise to a large variety of photoluminescence spectral signatures depending on the excitation power and collection set-up. We finally give guidelines to measure the real cavity quality factor by photoluminescence. 
0808.01015	QED$_{4}$ Ward Identity for fermionic field in the light-front	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:J. H. O. Sales, A. T. Suzuki, J.D. Bolzan	Abstract:  In a covariant gauge we implicitly assume that the Green's function propagates information from one point of the space-time to another, so that the Green's function is responsible for the dynamics of the relativistic particle. In the light front form, which in principle is a change of coordinates, one would expect that this feature would be preserved. In this manner, the fermion's field propagator can be split into a propagating piece and a non-propagating (``contact'') term. Since the latter (``contact'') one does not propagate information, and therefore, assumedly with no harm to the field dynamics we wanted to know what would be the impact of dropping it off. To do that, we investigated its role in the Ward identity in the light front.

Effective theories such as HQET are also discussed. Numerical results are shown for the extraction of ground-state and excited B-meson masses and the ground-state decay constant in the static approximation. 
0808.01018	Universality in the Energy Spectrum of Medium-Sized Quantum Dots	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Alexander Odriazola (1), Alain Delgado (2), Augusto González (1) ((1) Instituto de Cibern\'etica, Matem\'atica y F\'isica, Habana, (2) Centro de Aplicaciones Tecnol\'ogicas y Desarrollo Nuclear, Habana)    	Abstract:  In a two-dimensional parabolic quantum dot charged with $N$ electrons, Thomas-Fermi theory states that the ground-state energy satisfies the following non-trivial relation: $E_{gs}/(\hbarω)\approx N^{3/2} f_{gs}(N^{1/4}β)$, where the coupling constant, $β$, is the ratio between Coulomb and oscillator ($\hbarω$) characteristic energies, and $f_{gs}$ is a universal function. We perform extensive Configuration Interaction calculations in order to verify that the exact energies of relatively large quantum dots approximately satisfy the above relation. In addition, we show that the number of energy levels for intraband and interband (excitonic and biexcitonic) excitations of the dot follows a simple exponential dependence on the excitation energy, whose exponent, $1/Θ$, satisfies also an approximate scaling relation {\it a la} Thomas-Fermi, $Θ/(\hbarω)\approx N^{-γ} g(N^{1/4}β)$. We provide an analytic expression for $f_{gs}$, based on two-point Padé approximants, and two-parameter fits for the $g$ functions. 
0808.01019	Quantum SUSY Algebra of $Q$-lumps in the Massive Grassmannian Sigma Model	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Hiroaki Nakajima, Phillial Oh, Sunyoung Shin	Abstract:  We compute the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY algebra of the massive Grassmannian sigma model in 2+1 dimensions. We first rederive the action of the model by using the Scherk-Schwarz dimensional reduction from $\mathcal{N}=1$ theory in 3+1 dimensions. Then, we perform the canonical quantization by using the Dirac method. We find that a particular choice of the operator ordering yields the quantum SUSY algebra of the $Q$-lumps with cental extension.

0808.01021	Autoregressive description of biological phenomena	Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)	Authors:Vasile V Morariu, Calin Vamos, Alexadru Pop, Stefan M Soltuz, Luiza Buimaga-Iarinca, Oana Zainea	Abstract:  Many natural phenomena can be described by power-laws. A closer look at various experimental data reveals more or less significant deviations from a 1/f spectrum. We exemplify such cases with phenomena offered by molecular biology, cell biophysics, and cognitive psychology. Some of these cases can be described by first order autoregressive (AR) models or by higher order AR models which are short range correlation models. The calculations are checked against astrophysical data which were fitted to a an AR model by a different method. We found that our fitting method of the data give similar results for the astrhophysical data and therefore applied the method for examples mentioned above. Our results show that such phenomena can be described by first or higher order of AR models. Therefore such examples are described by short range correlation properties while they can be easily confounded with long range correlation phenomena. 
0808.01022	High-energy hadron-hadron (dipole-dipole) scattering from lattice QCD	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:M. Giordano, E. Meggiolaro	Abstract:  In this paper the problem of high-energy hadron-hadron (dipole-dipole) scattering is approached (for the first time) from the point of view of lattice QCD, by means of Monte Carlo numerical simulations. In the first part, we give a brief review of how high-energy scattering amplitudes can be reconstructed, using a functional-integral approach, in terms of certain correlation functions of two Wilson loops and we also briefly recall some relevant analyticity and crossing-symmetry properties of these loop-loop correlation functions, when going from Euclidean to Minkowskian theory. In the second part, we shall see how these (Euclidean) loop-loop correlation functions can be evaluated in lattice QCD and we shall compare our numerical results with some nonperturbative analytical estimates that appeared in the literature, discussing in particular the question of the analytic continuation from Euclidean to Minkowskian theory and its relation to the still unsolved problem of the asymptotic s-dependence of the hadron-hadron total cross sections.

Ferdeghini, M. Putti, E. Emerich	Abstract:  The crystal structure of SmFeAsO has been investigated by means of Rietveld refinement of high resolution synchrotron powder diffraction data collected at 300 K and 100 K. The compound crystallizes in the tetragonal P4/nmm space group at 300 K and in the orthorhombic Cmma space group at 100 K; attempts to refine the low temperature data in the monoclinic P112/n space group diverged. On the basis of both resistive and magnetic analyses the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition can be located at T about 140 K.

0808.01026	Some General Theorems of Incremental Thermoelectroelasticity	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Adriano Montanaro	Abstract:  We extend to incremental thermoelectroelasticity with biasing fields certain classical theorems, that have been stated and proved in linear thermopiezoelectricity referred to a natural configuration. A uniqueness theorem for the solutions to the initial boundary value problem, the generalized Hamilton principle and a theorem of reciprocity of work are deduced for incremental fields superposed on finite biasing fields in a thermoelectroelastic body.

The total cross section for diffractive Υ's is compared to recent HERA data. The amplitude is used to predict the cross section for exclusive ppbar \to ppbar Υ(1S,2S) process in hadronic reactions at Tevatron energies. We also included absorption effects. 
0808.01028	Energy Gaps and Kohn Anomalies in Elemental Superconductors	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:P. Aynajian, T. Keller, L. Boeri, S. M. Shapiro K. Habicht, B. Keimer	Abstract:  The momentum and temperature dependence of the lifetimes of acoustic phonons in the elemental superconductors Pb and Nb was determined by resonant spin-echo spectroscopy with neutrons. In both elements, the superconducting energy gap extracted from these measurements was found to converge with sharp anomalies originating from Fermi-surface nesting (Kohn anomalies) at low temperatures. The results indicate electron many-body correlations beyond the standard theoretical framework for conventional superconductivity. A possible mechanism is the interplay between superconductivity and spin- or charge-density-wave fluctuations, which may induce dynamical nesting of the Fermi surface. 
0808.01029	Bases in diagrammatic quantum protocols	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Bob Coecke, Eric Oliver Paquette, Simon Perdrix	Abstract:  This paper contains two new results: 1. We amend the notion of abstract basis in a dagger symmetric monoidal category, as well as its corresponding graphical representation, in order to accommodate non-self-dual dagger compact structures; this is crucial for obtaining a `planar' diagrammatical representation of the induced dagger compact structure as well as for representing many complementary bases within one diagrammatic calculus. 2. We (crucially) rely on these basis structures in a purely diagrammatic derivation of the `quantum state transfer protocol'; this derivation provides interesting insights in the distinct structural resources required for state-transfer and teleportation as models of quantum computing. 
0808.01030	Rejoinder: One-step sparse estimates in nonconcave penalized likelihood models	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Hui Zou, Runze Li	Abstract:  We would like to take this opportunity to thank the discussants for their thoughtful comments and encouragements on our work [arXiv:0808.1012]. The discussants raised a number of issues from theoretical as well as computational perspectives. Our rejoinder will try to provide some insights into these issues and address specific questions asked by the discussants. 
0808.01031	Commissioning of the ATLAS Experiment	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Juergen Thomas, for the ATLAS Collaboration at CERN	Abstract:  The status of the commissioning of the ATLAS experiment as of May 2008 is presented. The sub-detector integration in recent milestone weeks is described. Cosmic commissioning in milestone week M6 included simultaneous data-taking and combined track analysis of the muon detector and inner detector, as well as combined analysis of muon detector and muon trigger. The calorimeters have achieved near-full operation, and are integrated with the calorimeter trigger. The high-level-trigger infrastructure is being installed and algorithms tested in technical runs. 
0808.01032	Introducing categories to the practicing physicist	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Bob Coecke	Abstract:  We argue that category theory should become a part of the daily practice of the physicist, and more specific, the quantum physicist and/or informatician. The reason for this is not that category theory is a better way of doing mathematics, but that monoidal categories constitute the actual algebra of practicing physics. We will not provide rigorous definitions or anything resembling a coherent mathematical theory, but we will take the reader for a journey introducing concepts which are part of category theory in a manner that the physicist will recognize them. 
0808.01033	NGC 602 Environment, Kinematics and Origins	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:L. Nigra, J. S. Gallagher III, L. J. Smith, S. Stanimirovic, A. Nota, E. Sabbi	Abstract:  The young star cluster NGC 602 and its associated HII region, N90, formed in a relatively isolated and diffuse environment in the Wing of the Small Magellanic Cloud. Its isolation from other regions of massive star formation and the relatively simple surrounding HI shell structure allows us to constrain the processes that may have led to its formation and to study conditions leading to massive star formation. We use images from Hubble Space Telescope and high resolution echelle spectrographic data from the Anglo-Australian Telescope along with 21-cm neutral hydrogen (HI) spectrum survey data and the shell catalogue derived from it to establish a likely evolutionary scenario leading to the formation of NGC 602. We identify a distinct HI cloud component that is likely the progenitor cloud of the cluster and HII region which probably formed in blister fashion from the cloud's periphery. We also find that the past interaction of HI shells can explain the current location and radial velocity of the nebula. The surrounding Interstellar Medium is diffuse and dust-poor as demonstrated by a low visual optical depth throughout the nebula and an average HI density of the progenitor cloud estimated at 1 cm^-3. These conditions suggest that the NGC 602 star formation event was produced by compression and turbulence associated with HI shell interactions. It therefore represents a single star forming event in a low gas density region. 
0808.01034	Exclusive $eta_b$ decay to double $J/ψ$ at next-to-leading order in $alpha_s$	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Bin Gong, Yu Jia, Jian-Xiong Wang	Abstract:  Within the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization framework, we calculate the exclusive decay process η_b \to J/ψJ/ψto next-to-leading order in the strong coupling constant, while at leading order in charm quark relative velocity. It is found that this new contribution to the amplitude is comparable in magnitude with the previously calculated relativistic correction piece, but differs by a phase about 90^\circ. Including this new contribution will increase the previous prediction to B(η_b \to J/ψJ/ψ) substantially, thus brightening the discovery potential of this clean hadronic decay channel of η_b in the forthcoming LHC experiment. 
0808.01035	Global One-Dimensionality conjecture within Quantum General Relativity	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:L. A. Glinka	Abstract:  The simple quantum gravity model, based on a new conjecture within the canonically quantized 3+1 general relativity, is presented. The conjecture states that matter fields are functionals of an embedding volume form only, and reduces the quantum geometrodynamics. By dimensional reduction the resulting theory is presented in the form of the Dirac equation, and application of the Fock quantization with the diagonalization procedure yields construction of the appropriate quantum field theory. The 1D wave function is derived, the corresponding 3-dimensional manifolds are discussed, and physical scales are associated with quantum correlations. 
0808.01036	On Boundary Control Problems in Slow Processes for Piezothermoelastic Plates	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Adriano Montanaro	Abstract:  We consider a piezothermoelastic panel occupied by a material of hexagonal crystal class. We study the response when the boundary conditions vary very slowly with time and one of the bounding faces is subject to thermal exposure. We show that in some cases the temperature on the other bounding face can be controlled by the difference of electric potential between the faces. 
0808.01037	Toy quantum categories	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Bob Coecke, Bill Edwards	Abstract:  We show that Rob Spekken's toy quantum theory arises as an instance of our categorical approach to quantum axiomatics, as a (proper) subcategory of the dagger compact category FRel of finite sets and relations with the cartesian product as tensor, where observables correspond to dagger Frobenius algebras. This in particular implies that the quantum-like properties of the toy model are in fact very general category-theoretic properties. We also show the remarkable fact that we can already interpret complementary quantum observables on the two-element set FRel. 
0808.01038	A Banach space determined by the Weil height	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Daniel Allcock, Jeffrey D. Vaaler	Abstract:  The absolute logarithmic Weil height is well defined on the group of units of the algebraic closure of the rational numbers, modulo roots of unity, and induces a metric topology on this group. We show that the completion of this metric space is a Banach space over the field of real numbers. We further show that this Banach space is isometrically isomorphic to a co-dimension one subspace of L1 of a certain totally disconnected, locally compact space, equipped with a certain measure satisfying an invariance property with respect to the absolute Galois group. 
0808.01039	Gravity action on discontinuous metrics	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:V.M. Khatsymovsky	Abstract:  We consider minisuperspace gravity system described by piecewise flat metric discontinuous on three-dimensional faces (tetrahedra). There are infinite terms in the Einstein action. However, starting from proper regularization, these terms in the exponential of path integral result in pre-exponent factor with $δ$-functions requiring vanishing metric discontinuities. Thereby path integral measure in Regge calculus is related to path integral measure in Regge calculus where length of an edge is not constrained to be the same for all the 4-tetrahedra containing this edge, i.e. in Regge calculus with independent 4-tetrahedra. The result obtained is in accordance with our previous one obtained from symmetry considerations. 
0808.01040	Gluon density and $F_{2}$ functions from BK equation with local impact parameter dependence in DIS on nuclei	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Bondarenko Sergey	Abstract:  The DIS process on nuclei is considered in the framework of LO BK equation with local impact parameter dependence. Solving BK equation parameters for initial conditions of GBW type found in \cite{Serg1} were used. Integrated gluon density function and $F_2$ nucleus structure function for different nuclei are calculated. Obtained results are compared with the different parameterizations of integrated gluon density function from \cite{Flor,Eskola1,Eskola2,Tywon}. The anomalous dimensions and saturation scales for different nuclei are calculated at different energies. Fitting obtained results, expressions for the form of saturation scale are obtained for the proton and different nuclei as functions of impact parameter and energy. 
0808.01041	Independent 4-tetrahedra connection representation of Regge calculus	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:V.M. Khatsymovsky	Abstract:  We consider simplest piecewise flat manifold consisting of two identical 4-tetrahedra (call it bisimplex). General relativity action for arbitrary piecewise flat manifold can be expressed in terms of sum of the (half of) bisimplex actions. We use representation of each bisimplex action in terms of certain rotation matrices (connections). This gives representation of any minisuperspace piecewise flat gravity system in terms of connections which do not connect neighboring 4-tetrahedra (more appropriate would be call these self-connections). If Regge calculus with independent 4-tetrahedra is considered, i. e. when the length of an edge is not constrained to be the same for all the 4-tetrahedra containing this edge, self-connection representation leaves 4-tetrahedra independent also in connection matrices sector. Action remains sum of independent 4-tetrahedra terms. 
0808.01042	Defining some integrals in Regge calculus	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:V.M. Khatsymovsky	Abstract:  Regge calculus minisuperspace action in the connection representation has the form in which each term is linear over some field variable (scale of area-type variable with sign). We are interested in the result of performing integration over connections in the path integral. To find this function, we compute its moments, i. e. integrals with powers of that variable. Calculation proceeds through intermediate appearance of $δ$-functions and integrating them out and leads to finite result for any power. The function of interest should therefore be exponentially suppressed at large areas and it really does being restored from moments. This gives for gravity a way of defining such nonabsolutely convergent integral as path integral. 
0808.01043	Backreaction of superhorizon perturbations in scalar field cosmologies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Naresh Kumar, Eanna E. Flanagan	Abstract:  It has been suggested that the acceleration of the Universe may be due to the backreaction of perturbations to the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background. For a Universe dominated by cold dark matter, it is known that the backreaction of superhorizon perturbations can not drive acceleration. We extend this result to models with cold dark matter together with a scalar field. We show that the scalar field can drive acceleration only via the standard mechanism of a constant or nearly constant piece of its potential (i.e., a cosmological constant); there is no separate mechanism involving superhorizon backreaction. This rules out some models which have been proposed in the literature. 
0808.01044	SL(2,R) matrix model and supersymmetric Yang-Mills integrals	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Miguel Tierz	Abstract:  The density of states of Yang-Mills integrals in the supersymmetric case is characterized by power-law tails whose decay is independent of N, the rank of the gauge group. It is believed that this has no counterpart in matrix models, but we construct a matrix model that exactly exhibits this property. In addition, we show that the eigenfunctions employed to construct the matrix model are invariant under the collinear subgroup of conformal transformations, SL(2,R). We also show that the matrix model itself is invariant under a fractional linear transformation. The wave functions of the model appear in the trigonometric Rosen-Morse potential and in free relativistic motion on AdS space. 
0808.01045	Ultra high energy cosmic rays and neutrinos after Auger	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Todor Stanev (Bartol Research Institute, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Delaware)    	Abstract:  We discuss the main results that were recently published by the Auger Collaboration and their impact on our knowledge of the ultra high energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. 
0808.01046	About the geometry of almost para-quaternionic manifolds	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Liana David	Abstract:  We provide a general criteria for the integrability of the almost para-quaternionic structure of an almost para-quaternionic manifold (M,P) of dimension bigger or equal to eight, in terms of the integrability of two or three sections of the defining rank three vector bundle P. We relate it with the integrability of the canonical almost complex structure of the twistor space and to the integrability of the canonical almost para-complex structure of the reflector space of (M,P). We show that (M, P) has plenty of locally defined, compatible, complex and para-complex structures, provided that P is para-quaternionic. 
0808.01047	Cosmological constant in a quantum fluid model	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:J. A. Sanchez-Monroy, C. J. Quimbay (Colombia, U. Natl.)    	Abstract:  Possible analogies between vacuum state and quantum fluid provide a model to study vacuum energy density induced by thermal corrections, space-time curvature, boundary conditions and quantum back-reaction. We find that vacuum energy density in this quantum fluid model is not naturally of the order of the matter energy density. We show how higher-order corrections in quantum back-reaction can also contribute to vacuum energy density, and how the cosmological expansion is a manifestation of an universe out of mechanical equilibrium. This last fact implies that simple thermodynamic arguments are not enough to explain the cosmological constant problem due to the calculation of the associated vacuum energy density requires first the knowing of the underlying microscopic physics of vacuum. 
0808.01048	Charge carrier induced barrier height reduction at organic heterojunctions	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:S. W. Tsang, M. W. Denhoff, Y. Tao, Z. H. Lu	Abstract:  In order to provide an accurate theoretical description of current density voltage (J-V) characteristics of an organic heterojunction device over a wide range of electric fields at various temperatures, it is proposed that an accumulation of charge carriers at the heterojunction will lead to a reduction in the barrier height across the heterojunction. Two well-known hole transporting materials, 4,4,4-Tris(N-3-methylphenyl-N-phenyl-amino) triphenylamine (MTDATA) and N,N-diphenyl-N,N-bis(1-naphthyl)(1,1-biphenyl)-4,4diamine (NPB) were used to fabricate unipolar heterojunction devices. It is found that the J-V characteristics depends strongly on applied bias. The simulated J-V characteristics of the heterojunction device, with the modified injection model, are found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data. 
0808.01049	Is there Quark Matter in (Low-Mass) Pulsars?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Irina Sagert, Giuseppe Pagliara, Matthias Hempel, Jürgen Schaffner-Bielich	Abstract:  The effect of the QCD phase transition is studied for the mass-radius relation of compact stars and for hot and dense matter at a given proton fraction used as input in core-collapse supernova simulations. The phase transitions to the 2SC and CFL color superconducting phases lead to stable hybrid star configurations with a pure quark matter core. In supernova explosions quark matter could be easily produced due to $β$-equilibrium, small proton fractions and nonvanishing temperatures. A low critical density for the phase transition to quark matter is compatible with present pulsar mass measurements. 
0808.01050	Modelling ultra-fine structure in dark matter halos	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Daniele S. M. Fantin, Michael R. Merrifield, Anne M. Green	Abstract:  Various laboratory-based experiments are underway attempting to detect dark matter directly. The event rates and detailed signals expected in these experiments depend on the dark matter phase space distribution on sub-milliparsec scales. These scales are many orders of magnitude smaller than those that can be resolved by conventional N-body simulations, so one cannot hope to use such tools to investigate the effect of mergers in the history of the Milky Way on the detailed phase-space structure probed by the current experiments. In this paper we present an alternative approach to investigating the results of such mergers, by studying a simplified model for a merger of a sub-halo with a larger parent halo. With an appropriate choice of parent halo potential, the evolution of material from the sub-halo can be expressed analytically in action-angle variables, so it is possible to obtain its entire orbit history very rapidly without numerical integration. Furthermore by evolving backwards in time, we can obtain arbitrarily-high spatial resolution for the current velocity distribution at a fixed point. Although this model cannot provide a detailed quantitative comparison with the Milky Way, its properties are sufficiently generic that it offers qualitative insight into the expected structure arising from a merger at a resolution that cannot be approached with full numerical simulations. Preliminary results indicate that the velocity-space distribution of dark matter particles remains characterized by discrete and well-defined peaks over an extended period of time, both for single and multi-merging systems, in contrast to the simple smooth velocity distributions sometimes assumed in predicting laboratory experiment detection rates. 
0808.01051	Exploring Pure Spinor String Theory on AdS_4 x CP^3	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Giulio Bonelli, Pietro Antonio Grassi, Houman Safaai	Abstract:  In this paper we formulate the pure spinor superstring theory on AdS_4 x CP^3. By recasting the pure spinor action as a topological A-model on the fermionic supercoset Osp(6|4)/SO(6)xSp(4) plus a BRST exact term, we prove the exactness of the sigma-model. We then give a gauged linear sigma-model which reduces to the superstring in the limit of large volume and we study its branch geometry in different phases. Moreover, we discuss possible D-brane boundary conditions and the principal chiral model for the fermionic supercoset. 
0808.01052	Structural approximations to positive maps and entanglement breaking channels	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:J. K. Korbicz, M. L. Almeida, J. Bae, M. Lewenstein, A. Acin	Abstract:  Structural approximations to positive, but not completely positive maps are approximate physical realizations of these non-physical maps. They find applications in the design of direct entanglement detection methods. We show that many of these approximations, in the relevant case of optimal positive maps, define an entanglement breaking channel and, consequently, can be implemented via a measurement and state-preparation protocol. We also show how our findings can be useful for the design of better and simpler direct entanglement detection methods. 
0808.01053	Low Mass X-ray Binaries and Black Holes in Globular Clusters	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Arunav Kundu, Thomas J. Maccarone, Stephen E. Zepf, I. Chun Shih, Katherine L. Rhode	Abstract:  Studies of nearby galaxies reveal that roughly half of their low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) populations are associated with globular clusters (GCs). We have established that the LMXB hosting frequency is correlated to various GC properties such as mass and metallicity. While the X-ray luminosities of a few of the brightest LMXBs in GCs are consistent with the accreting object being a black hole (BH), the only definitive way to distinguish between a black hole and multiple superposed sources in a GC is to detect variability. We have discovered just such a variable 4x10^39 erg/s black hole X-ray binary in a low metallicity globular cluster in the halo of NGC 4472. The change in the X-ray spectrum between the bright and faint epochs suggests that the luminosity variation is due to eclipsing by a warped accretion disk. The optical spectrum of this source also reveals strong, broad, [O III] lambda 5007 and [O III] lambda 4959 emission. An analysis of the X-ray spectrum suggests that the [O III] lines are produced by the photoionization of a wind driven by a stellar mass black hole accreting mass at or above its Eddington luminosity. As it is dynamically implausible to form an accreting stellar mass BH system in a GC with an intermediate mass BH it appears that this massive globular cluster does not harbor an intermediate mass BH. The inferred mass of this BH falls well below the extrapolation of the well known M_BH-sigma and M_BH-M_Stellar relations to this GC. Therefore our analysis suggests that not all old, metal poor stellar systems form black holes consistent with these relations, which have been established for much more massive stellar systems. 
0808.01054	Three-Loop Leading Singularities and BDS Ansatz for Five Particles	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Marcus Spradlin, Anastasia Volovich, Congkao Wen	Abstract:  We use the leading singularity technique to determine the planar three-loop five-particle amplitude in N=4 super Yang-Mills in terms of a simple basis of integrals. We analytically compute the integral coefficients for both the parity-even and the parity-odd parts of the amplitude. The parity-even part involves only dual conformally invariant integrals. Using the method of obstructions we numerically evaluate two previously unfixed coefficients which appear in the three-loop BDS ansatz. 
0808.01055	Perturbative description of inclusive single hadron production at HERA	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Simon Albino	Abstract:  Light charged hadron production data in the current fragmentation region at HERA are calculated using next-to-leading order perturbative calculations and fragmentation functions obtained from similar data from e+ e- reactions. General good agreement is found at large photon virtuality Q^2 and intermediate momentum fraction x_p, consistent with fragmentation function universality. The description of the small x_p and Q^2 region is improved by incorporating hadron mass effects. 
0808.01056	Effects of Beta-Decays of Excited-State Nuclei on the Astrophysical r-Process	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M.A. Famiano, R.N. Boyd, T. Kajino, K. Otsuki, M. Terasawa, G.J. Mathews	Abstract:  A rudimentary calculation is employed to evaluate the possible effects of beta- decays of excited-state nuclei on the astrophysical r-process. Single-particle levels calculated with the FRDM are adapted to the calculation of beta-decay rates of these excited-state nuclei. Quantum numbers are determined based on proximity to Nilson model levels. The resulting rates are used in an r-process network calculation in which a supernova hot-bubble model is coupled to an extensive network calculation including all nuclei between the valley of stability and the neutron drip line and with masses A<284. Beta-decay rates are included as functional forms of the environmental temperature. While the decay rate model used is simple and phenomenological, it is consistent across all 3700 nuclei involved in the r-process network calculation. This represents an approximate first estimate to gauge the possible effects of excited-state beta-decays on r-process freeze-out abundances. 
0808.01057	Quarkyonic Matter and the Phase Diagram of QCD	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Larry McLerran	Abstract:  Quarkyonic matter is a new phase of QCD at finite temperature and density which is distinct from the confined and de-confined phases. Its existence is unambiguously argued in the large number of colors limit in QCD. Hints of its existence for 3 color QCD are shown in lattice Monte-Carlo data and heavy ion experiments. 
0808.01058	The Laurent norm	Algebraic Topology (math.AT)	Authors:David G. Long	Abstract:  We generalize a semi-norm for the Alexander polynomial of a connected, compact, oriented 3-manifold on its first cohomology group to a semi-norm for an arbitrary Laurent polynomial f on the dual vector space to the space of exponents of f. We determine a decomposition formula for this Laurent norm; an expression for the Laurent norm for f in terms of the Laurent norms for each of the irreducible factors of f. For an n-variable polynomial f, we introduce a space of m \leq n essential variables which determine the reduced Laurent norm unit ball; a convex polyhedron of the same dimension m as the Newton polyhedron of f. In the space spanned by the essential variables, the Laurent semi-norm for polynomials with at least two terms is shown to be a norm. 
0808.01059	Precise measurement of Br(tau^- -> K^*0(892) K^- nu_tau) and the mass and width of the K^*0(892) meson	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The Belle Collaboration: I. Adachi, et al    	Abstract:  Using the high statistics tau data sample recorded in the Belle experiment at KEKB, we have greatly improved the precision of the branching fraction Br(tau^- -> K^*0(892) K^- nu_tau) = (1.56+-0.02+-0.09)x10^-3, while the mass and width of the K^*0(892) meson are measured to be (895.10+-0.27+-0.31) MeV/c^2 and (47.23+-0.49+-0.79) MeV/c^2, respectively, with better accuracy than the PDG world average values. The first measurement of the decay tau^- -> K^*0(892) K^- pi^0 nu_tau is also reported with a branching fraction of Br(tau^- -> K^*0(892) K^- pi^0 nu_tau)=(2.39+-0.46+-0.26)x10^-5.

0808.01061	Arithmetic of K3 surfaces	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Matthias Schuett	Abstract:  We review recent developments in the arithmetic of K3 surfaces. Our focus lies on aspects of modularity, Picard number and rational points. Throughout we emphasise connections to geometry. 
0808.01062	Optimization of Location Management for PCS Networks with CTRW Mobility Model	Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)	Authors:Qinglin Zhao, Soung C. Liew	Abstract:  This paper considers the design of the optimal locationupdate area (LA) of the distance-based scheme for personal communication service (PCS) networks. We focus on the optimization of two design parameters associated with the LA: 1) initial position upon LA update; 2) distance threshold for triggering of LA update. Based on the popular continuous-time random walk (CTRW) mobility model, we propose a novel analytical framework that uses a diffusion equation to minimize the location management cost. In this framework, a number of measurable physical parameters, such as length of road section, angle between road sections, and road section crossing time, can be integrated into the system design. This framework allows us to easily evaluate the total cost under general call arrival distributions and LA of different shapes. For the particular case of circular LA and small Poisson call-arrival rate, we prove the following: (1) When the drift is weak, the optimal initial position approaches the center of the LA; when the drift is strong, it approaches the boundary of the LA. (2) Comparing the optimal initial-position and center-initial-position solutions (which is assumed in most prior work), when the drift is weak, the optimal distance threshold and the minimum total cost are roughly equal; when the drift is strong, the optimal distance threshold in the later is about 1.260 times that in the former, and the minimum total cost in the later is about 1.587 times that in the former. That is, optimizing on initial position, which previous work did not consider, has the potential of reducing the cost measure by 37%. 
0808.01063	Sheet Dependence on Superconducting Gap in Oxygen-Deficient Iron-based Oxypnictide Superconductors NdFeAs0.85	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Yoshihiro Aiura, Koji Sato, Hideaki Iwasawa, Yosuke Nakashima, Akihiro Ino, Masashi Arita, Kenya Shimada, Hirofumi Namatame, Masaki Taniguchi, Izumi Hase, Kiichi Miyazawa, Parasharam M. Shirage, Hiroshi Eisaki, Hijiri Kito, Akira Iyo	Abstract:  Photoemission spectroscopy with low-energy tunable photons on oxygen-deficient iron-based oxypnictide superconductors NdFeAsO0.85 (Tc=52K) reveals a distinct photon-energy dependence of the electronic structure near the Fermi level (EF). A clear shift of the leading-edge can be observed in the superconducting states with 9.5 eV photons, while a clear Fermi cutoff with little leading-edge shift can be observed with 6.0 eV photons. The results are indicative of the superconducting gap opening not on the hole-like ones around Gamma (0,0) point but on the electron-like sheets around M(pi,pi) point. 
0808.01064	On Strong Convergence to Equilibrium for the Boltzmann Equation with Soft Potentials	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Eric A. Carlen, Maria C. Carvalho, Xuguang Lu	Abstract:  The paper concerns $L^1$- convergence to equilibrium for weak solutions of the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann Equation for soft potentials $(-4\le \gm<0$), with and without angular cutoff. We prove the time-averaged $L^1$-convergence to equilibrium for all weak solutions whose initial data have finite entropy and finite moments up to order greater than $2+|\gm|$. For the usual $L^1$-convergence we prove that the convergence rate can be controlled from below by the initial energy tails, and hence, for initial data with long energy tails, the convergence can be arbitrarily slow. We also show that under the integrable angular cutoff on the collision kernel with $-1\le \gm<0$, there are algebraic upper and lower bounds on the rate of $L^1$-convergence to equilibrium. Our methods of proof are based on entropy inequalities and moment estimates. 
0808.01065	Infinite log-concavity: developments and conjectures	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Peter R. W. McNamara, Bruce E. Sagan	Abstract:  Given a sequence (a_k) = a_0, a_1, a_2,... of real numbers, define a new sequence L(a_k) = (b_k) where b_k = a_k^2 - a_{k-1} a_{k+1}. So (a_k) is log-concave if and only if (b_k) is a nonnegative sequence. Call (a_k) "infinitely log-concave" if L^i(a_k) is nonnegative for all i >= 1. Boros and Moll conjectured that the rows of Pascal's triangle are infinitely log-concave. Using a computer and a stronger version of log-concavity, we prove their conjecture for the nth row for all n <= 1450. We also use our methods to give a simple proof of a recent result of Uminsky and Yeats about regions of infinite log-concavity. We investigate related questions about the columns of Pascal's triangle, q-analogues, symmetric functions, real-rooted polynomials, and Toeplitz matrices. In addition, we offer several conjectures. 
0808.01066	Alexander and Thurston norms of graph links	Algebraic Topology (math.AT)	Authors:David G. Long	Abstract:  We show that the Alexander and Thurston norms are the same for all irreducible Eisenbud-Neumann graph links in homology 3-spheres. These are the links obtained by splicing Seifert links in homology 3-spheres together along tori. By combining this result with previous results, we prove that the two norms coincide for all links in S^3 if either of the following two conditions are met; the link is a graph link, so that the JSJ decomposition of its complement in S^3 is made up of pieces which are all Seifert-fibered, or the link is alternating and not a (2,n)-torus link, so that the JSJ decomposition of its complement in S^3 is made up of pieces which are all hyperbolic. We use the E-N obstructions to fibrations for graph links together with the Thurston cone theorem on link fibrations to deduce that every facet of the reduced Thurston norm unit ball of a graph link is a fibered facet. 
0808.01067	Classification of Swift's gamma-ray bursts	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:I. Horvath, L. G. Balazs, Z. Bagoly, P. Veres	Abstract:  Two classes of gamma-ray bursts have been identified in the BATSE catalogs characterized by durations shorter and longer than about 2 seconds. There are, however, some indications for the existence of a third class. Swift satellite detectors have different spectral sensitivity than pre-Swift ones for gamma-ray bursts. Therefore, it is worth to reanalyze the durations and their distribution. We analyze, the maximum likelihood estimation, the bursts duration distribution, published in The First BAT Catalog, whether it contains two, three or more groups. The three log-normal fit is significantly (99.54% probability) better than the two for the duration distribution. Monte-Carlo simulations also confirm this probability (99.2%). Similarly, in previous results we found that the fourth component is not needed. The relative frequencies of the distribution of the groups are 7% short 35% intermediate and 58% long. Although the relative frequencies of the groups are different than in the BATSE GRB sample, the difference in the instrument spectral sensitivities can explain this bias on a natural way. This means theoretical models may be needed to explain three different type of gamma-ray bursts. 
0808.01068	Symplectic approach to quantum constraints	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Dorje C. Brody, Anna C. T. Gustavsson, Lane P. Hughston	Abstract:  A general prescription for the treatment of constrained quantum motion is outlined. We consider in particular constraints defined by algebraic submanifolds of the quantum state space. The resulting formalism is applied to obtain solutions to the constrained dynamics of systems of multiple spin-1/2 particles. When the motion is constrained to a certain product space containing all of the energy eigenstates, the dynamics thus obtained are quasi-unitary in the sense that the equations of motion take a form identical to that of unitary motion, but with different boundary conditions. When the constrained subspace is a product space of disentangled states, the associated motion is more intricate. Nevertheless, the equations of motion satisfied by the dynamical variables are obtained in closed form. 
0808.01069	The unusual pre-main-sequence star V718 Per (HMW 15)	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:V. Grinin, H. C. Stempels, G. F. Gahm, S. Sergeev, A. Arkharov, O. Barsunova, L. Tambovtseva	Abstract:  The remarkable pre-main-sequence object V718 Per (HMW 15, H187) in the young cluster IC 348 periodically undergoes long-lasting eclipses caused by variable amounts of circumstellar dust in the line-of-sight to the star. It has been speculated that the star is a close binary and similar to another unusual eclipsing object, KH 15D. We have submitted V718 Per to a detailed photometric and spectroscopic study to find out more about the properties of the stellar object and the occulting circumstellar material, and to look for signatures of a possible binary component. Our photometric data show that the eclipses are very symmetric and persistent, and that the extinction deviates only little from what is expected for normal interstellar material. The spectroscopic data, obtained at minimum as well as at maximum brightness, indicate a primordial abundance of Li and a surface effective temperature of about 5200 K. Remarkably, the in-eclipse spectrum shows a significant broadening of the photospheric absorption lines, as well as a weak increase in emission components of H-alpha and the Ca II IR triplet. We did not detect any atomic or molecular features from to the occulting body in the in-eclipse spectrum. We also found no evidence of radial velocity changes in V718 Per to within about +/- 80 m/s, which for an edge-on system corresponds to a maximum companion mass of 6 Jupiter masses. Our observations suggest that V718 Per is a single star, and thus very different from KH 15D. We conclude that V718 Per is surrounded by an edge-on circumstellar disk with an irregular mass distribution orbiting at a distance of 3.3 AU from the star, presumably at the inner disk edge. We ascribe the broadening of photospheric absorption lines during the eclipse to forward scattering of stellar light in the circumstellar dust feature. 
0808.01070	Hopf algebras and the combinatorics of connected graphs in quantum field theory	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Angela Mestre, Robert Oeckl	Abstract:  In this talk, we are concerned with the formulation and understanding of the combinatorics of time-ordered n-point functions in terms of the Hopf algebra of field operators. Mathematically, this problem can be formulated as one in combinatorics or graph theory. It consists in finding a recursive algorithm that generates all connected graphs in their Hopf algebraic representation. This representation can be used directly and efficiently in evaluating Feynman graphs as contributions to the n-point functions. 
0808.01071	On the equilibrium rotation of Earth-like extra-solar planets	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Alexandre C.M. Correia, Benjamin Levrard, Jacques Laskar	Abstract:  The equilibrium rotation of tidally evolved "Earth-like" extra-solar planets is often assumed to be synchronous with their orbital mean motion. The same assumption persisted for Mercury and Venus until radar observations revealed their true spin rates. As many of these planets follow eccentric orbits and are believed to host dense atmospheres, we expect the equilibrium rotation to differ from the synchronous motion. Here we provide a general description of the allowed final equilibrium rotation states of these planets, and apply this to already discovered cases in which the mass is lower than twelve Earth-masses. At low obliquity and moderate eccentricity, it is shown that there are at most four distinct equilibrium possibilities, one of which can be retrograde. Because most presently known "Earth-like" planets present eccentric orbits, their equilibrium rotation is unlikely to be synchronous. 
0808.01072	Mass-loss and diffusion in subdwarf B stars and hot white dwarfs: do weak winds exist?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Klaus Unglaub	Abstract:  The effect of diffusion on the chemical composition of subdwarf B (sdB) stars and of hot white dwarfs strongly depends on the presence of weak winds. In the paper, for stars with half a solar mass, for various effective temperatures between 25000 K and 50000 K, and for various metallicities between solar and 1/100 solar, the mass loss rates are predicted as a function of the surface gravity. With assumptions similar to the original theory of radiatively driven winds, the method of solution of the momentum equation has been modified, because the usual parametrization of the line force multiplier leads to complications in the case of weak winds. According to the results, weak winds with mass-loss rates of the order E-11 solar masses per year may exist only for the most luminous sdB stars. For the more compact ones, the decoupling of the metals from the bulk matter (hydrogen and helium) is expected in the wind region, because the momentum exchange via Coulomb collisions is not effective enough. Thus multicomponent effects are of great importance. For the case of white dwarfs no wind solution exists at all, if multicomponent effects are neglected. 
0808.01073	Entropy flow of a perfect fluid in (1+1) hydrodynamics	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Guillaume Beuf, Robi Peschanski, Emmanuel N. Saridakis	Abstract:  Using the formalism of the Khalatnikov potential, we derive exact general formulae for the entropy flow dS/dy, where y is the rapidity, as a function of temperature for the (1+1) relativistic hydrodynamics of a perfect fluid. We study in particular flows dominated by a sufficiently long hydrodynamic evolution, and provide an explicit analytical solution for dS/dy. We discuss the theoretical implications of our general formulae and some phenomenological applications for heavy-ion collisions. 
0808.01074	Three-dimensional models of metal-poor stars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:R. Collet	Abstract:  I present here the main results of recent realistic, 3D, hydrodynamical simulations of convection at the surface of metal-poor red giant stars. I discuss the application of these convection simulations as time-dependent, 3D, hydrodynamical model atmospheres to spectral line formation calculations and abundance analyses. The impact of 3D models on derived elemental abundances is investigated by means of a differential comparison of the line strengths predicted in 3D under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) with the results of analogous line formation calculations performed with classical, 1D, hydrostatic model atmospheres. The low surface temperatures encountered in the upper photospheric layers of 3D model atmospheres of very metal-poor stars cause spectral lines of neutral metals and molecules to appear stronger in 3D than in 1D calculations. Hence, 3D elemental abundances derived from such lines are significantly lower than estimated by analyses with 1D models. In particular, differential 3D$-$1D LTE abundances for C, N, and O derived from CH, NH, and OH lines are found to be in the range -0.5 to -1 dex. Large negative differential 3D-1D corrections to the Fe abundance are also computed for weak low-excitation neutral Fe lines. The application of metal-poor 3D models to the spectroscopic analysis of extremely iron-poor halo stars is discussed. 
0808.01075	Statistical physics of cerebral embolization leading to stroke	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:J.P.Hague, E.M.L.Chung	Abstract:  We discuss the physics of embolic stroke using a minimal model of emboli moving through the cerebral arteries. Our model of the blood flow network consists of a bifurcating tree, into which we introduce particles (emboli) that halt flow on reaching a node of similar size. Flow is weighted away from blocked arteries, inducing an effective interaction between emboli. We justify the form of the flow weighting using a steady flow (Poiseuille) analysis and a more complicated nonlinear analysis. We discuss free flowing and heavily congested limits and examine the transition from free flow to congestion using numerics. The correlation time is found to increase significantly at a critical value, and a finite size scaling is carried out. An order parameter for non-equilibrium critical behavior is identified as the overlap of blockages' flow shadows. Our work shows embolic stroke to be a feature of the cerebral blood flow network on the verge of a phase transition. 
0808.01076	Power-law scaling in protein synthesis of a stochastic regulon	Cell Behavior (q-bio.CB)	Authors:Emily Chapman-McQuiston, Chuck Yeung, X.L. Wu	Abstract:  We investigate the protein expression pattern of the lamB gene in Escherichia coli LE392. The gene product LamB is an important membrane protein for maltose transport into cells but it is also exploited by bacteriophage lambda for infection. Although our bacterial population is clonal, stochastic gene expression leads to a majority population with a large receptor number and a minority population with a small receptor number. We find that the LamB receptor distribution p(n) of the small-n population is scale invariant with the exponent depending on growth conditions. A heuristic model is proposed that relates the observed exponent to the protein production rate. 
0808.01077	Bottomonium masses, decay rates and scalar charge radii	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:J N Pandya, Ajay Kumar Rai, P C Vinodkumar	Abstract:  The masses of bottomonium s and p-states, decay constants, leptonic as well as radiative decay widths are computed in the framework of extended harmonic confinement model without any additional parameters. 
0808.01078	Rapid Molecular Cloud and Star Formation: Mechanisms and Movies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Fabian Heitsch, Lee Hartmann (U of Michigan)    	Abstract:  We demonstrate that the observationally inferred rapid onset of star formation after parental molecular clouds have assembled can be achieved by flow-driven cloud formation of atomic gas, using our previous three-dimensional numerical simulations. We post-process these simulations to approximate CO formation, which allows us to investigate the times at which CO becomes abundant relative to the onset of cloud collapse. We find that global gravity in a finite cloud has two crucial effects on cloud evolution. (a) Lateral collapse (perpendicular to the flows sweeping up the cloud) leads to rapidly increasing column densities above the accumulation from the one-dimensional flow. This in turn allows fast formation of CO, allowing the molecular cloud to ``appear'' rapidly. (b) Global gravity is required to drive the dense gas to the high pressures necessary to form solar-mass cores, in support of recent analytical models of cloud fragmentation. While the clouds still appear ``supersonically turbulent'', this turbulence is relegated to playing a secondary role, in that it is to some extent a consequence of gravitational forces. 
0808.01079	Chern-Simons theory, exactly solvable models and free fermions at finite temperature	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Miguel Tierz	Abstract:  We show that matrix models in Chern-Simons theory admit an interpretation as 1D exactly solvable models, paralleling the relationship between the Gaussian matrix model and the Calogero model. We compute the corresponding Hamiltonians, ground-state wavefunctions and ground-state energies and point out that the models can be interpreted as quasi-1D Coulomb plasmas. We also study the relationship between Chern-Simons theory on $S^3$ and a system of N one-dimensional fermions at finite temperature with harmonic confinement. In particular we show that the Chern-Simons partition function can be described by the density matrix of the free fermions in a very particular, crystalline, configuration. For this, we both use the Brownian motion and the matrix model description of Chern-Simons theory and find several common features with c=1 theory at finite temperature. Finally, using the exactly solvable model result, we show that the finite temperature effect can be described with a specific two-body interaction term in the Hamiltonian, with 1D Coulombic behavior at large separations. 
0808.01080	Luminosity distance in "Swiss cheese" cosmology with randomized voids: I. Single void size	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:R. Ali Vanderveld, Eanna E. Flanagan, Ira Wasserman	Abstract:  Recently there have been suggestions that the Type Ia supernova data can be explained using only general relativity and cold dark matter with no dark energy. In "Swiss cheese" models of the Universe, the standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker picture is modified by the introduction of mass compensating spherical inhomogeneities, typically described by the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi metric. If these inhomogeneities correspond to underdense cores surrounded by mass-compensating overdense shells, then they can modify the luminosity distance-redshift relation in a way that can mimic accelerated expansion. It has been argued that this effect could be large enough to explain the supernova data without introducing dark energy or modified gravity. We show that the large apparent acceleration seen in some models can be explained in terms of standard weak field gravitational lensing together with insufficient randomization of void locations. The underdense regions focus the light less than the homogeneous background, thus dimming supernovae in a way that can mimic the effects of acceleration. With insufficient randomization of the spatial location of the voids and of the lines of sight, coherent defocusing can lead to anomalously large demagnification effects. We show that a proper randomization of the voids and lines of sight reduces the effect to the point that it can no longer explain the supernova data. 
0808.01081	The kinematic origin of the cosmological redshift	Popular Physics (physics.pop-ph)	Authors:Emory F. Bunn, David W. Hogg	Abstract:  A common belief about big-bang cosmology is that the cosmological redshift cannot be properly viewed as a Doppler shift (that is, as evidence for a recession velocity), but must be viewed in terms of the stretching of space. We argue that, contrary to this view, the most natural interpretation of the redshift is as a Doppler shift, or rather as the accumulation of many infinitesimal Doppler shifts. The stretching-of-space interpretation obscures a central idea of relativity, namely that it is always valid to choose a coordinate system that is locally Minkowskian. We show that an observed frequency shift in any spacetime can be interpreted either as a kinematic (Doppler) shift or a gravitational shift by imagining a suitable family of observers along the photon's path. In the context of the expanding universe the kinematic interpretation corresponds to a family of comoving observers and hence is more natural. 
0808.01082	Spin Waves and Quantum Criticality in the Frustrated XY Pyrochlore Antiferromagnet Er2Ti2O7	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:J.P.C. Ruff, J.P. Clancy, A. Bourque, M.A. White, M. Ramazanoglu, J.S. Gardner, Y. Qiu, J.R.D. Copley, H.A. Dabkowska, B.D. Gaulin	Abstract:  We report detailed measurements of the low temperature magnetic phase diagram of Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$. Heat capacity and time-of-flight neutron scattering studies of single crystals, subject to magnetic fields applied along the crystallographic [110] direction, reveal unconventional low energy states. Er$^{3+}$ magnetic ions reside on a pyrochlore lattice in Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, where local XY anisotropy and antiferromagnetic interactions give rise to a unique frustrated system. In zero field, the ground state exhibits coexisting short and long range order, accompanied by soft collective spin excitations previously believed to be absent. The application of finite magnetic fields tunes the ground state continuously through a landscape of non-collinear phases, divided by a zero temperature phase transition at $μ_0 H_c \sim$ 1.5 T. The characteristic energy scale for spin fluctuations is seen to vanish at the critical point, as expected for a second order quantum phase transition driven by quantum fluctuations. 
0808.01083	The general relativistic Poynting-Robertson effect	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Donato Bini, Robert T. Jantzen, Luigi Stella	Abstract:  The general relativistic version is developed for Robertson's discussion of the Poynting-Robertson effect that he based on special relativity and Newtonian gravity for point radiation sources like stars. The general relativistic model uses a test radiation field of photons in outward radial motion with zero angular momentum in the equatorial plane of the exterior Schwarzschild or Kerr spacetime. 
0808.01084	Homogenization procedure for a metamaterial and local violation of the second principle of thermodynamics	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Nadia Mattiucci, Giuseppe D'Aguanno, Neset Akozbek, Michael Scalora, Mark J. Bloemer	Abstract:  Classical theory of crystals states that a medium to be considered homogeneous must satisfy the following requirements: a) the dimension of the elementary cell must be much smaller than the incident wavelength; b) the sample must contain a large number of elementary cells, i.e. it must be macroscopic with respect to wavelength. Under these conditions, macroscopic quantities can be introduced in order to describe the optical response of the medium. We analytically demonstrate that for a symmetric elementary cell those requirements can be relaxed, and it is possible to assign a permittivity and a permeability to a composite structure, even if the metamaterial cannot be considered homogeneous under the requirements stated above. However, the effective permittivity and permeability in some cases may give rise to unphysical, effective behaviors inside the medium, notwithstanding the fact that they satisfy requirements like being Kramers-Kronig pairs, for example, and are consistent with all the linear properties outside the structure (i.e. reflection, transmission, and absorption at all frequencies). In some situations the medium is assigned a magnetic response even though the medium is not magnetically active. In particular, we demonstrate that the homogenization procedure can lead to a medium that locally violates the second principle of thermodynamics. We also show that, in the non-homogeneous regime, it is not possible to describe the nonlinear behavior of the structure using an effective parameters approach, despite the possibility to assign an effective linear refractive index. 
0808.01085	An intermediate regime for exit phenomena driven by non-Gaussian Levy noises	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Zhihui Yang, Jinqiao Duan	Abstract:  A dynamical system driven by non-Gaussian Lévy noises of small intensity is considered. The first exit time of solution orbits from a bounded neighborhood of an attracting equilibrium state is estimated. For a class of non-Gaussian Lévy noises, it is shown that the mean exit time is asymptotically faster than exponential (the well-known Gaussian Brownian noise case) but slower than polynomial (the stable Lévy noise case), in terms of the reciprocal of the small noise intensity. 
0808.01086	Electron-phonon Interaction in Non-polar Quantum Dots Induced by the Amorphous Polar Environment	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:A.N. Poddubny, S. V. Goupalov, V.I. Kozub, I. N. Yassievich	Abstract:  We propose a mechanism of energy relaxation for carriers confined in a non-polar quantum dot surrounded by an amorphous polar environment. The carrier transitions are due to their interaction with the oscillating electric field induced by the local vibrations in the surrounding amorphous medium. We demonstrate that this mechanism controls energy relaxation for electrons in Si nanocrystals embedded in a SiO$_2$ matrix, where conventional mechanisms of electron-phonon interaction are not efficient. 
0808.01087	Extending Soft-Collinear-Effective-Theory to describe hard jets in dense QCD media	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Ahmad Idilbi, Abhijit Majumder	Abstract:  An extension to the Soft-Collinear-Effective Theory (SCET) description of hard jets is motivated to include the leading contributions between the propagating partons within the jet with partons radiated from a dense extended medium. The resulting effective Lagrangian, containing both a leading and a power suppressed (in the hard scale $Q^2$) contribution, arises primarily from interactions between the hard collinear modes in the jet with Glauber modes from the medium. In this first attempt, the interactions between the hard jet and soft and collinear partonic modes have been ignored, in an effort to focus solely on the interactions with the Glauber modes. While the effect of such modes on vacuum cross sections are suppressed by powers of the hard scale compared to the terms from the SCET Lagrangian, such sub-leading contributions are enhanced by the extent of the medium and result in measurable corrections. The veracity of the derived Lagrangian is checked by direct comparison with known results from full QCD calculations of two physical observables: the transverse momentum broadening of hard jets in dense media and a reanalysis of the transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF). 
0808.01088	Nonlinear resonances in δ-kicked Bose-Einstein Condensates	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:T. S. Monteiro, A Rancon, J. Ruostekoski	Abstract:  We investigate the Quantum Resonance (QR) regime of a periodically kicked atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. We find that the clearest indicator of the nonlinear dynamics is a surprisingly abrupt cut-off which appears on the main "Talbot time" QR. We show that this is due and excitation path combining both Beliaev and Landau processes, with some analogies to nonlinear self-trapping. Investigation of dynamical instability reveals further symptoms of nonlinearity such as a regime of exponential oscillations. 
0808.01089	Combination of CDF and D0 Results on the Mass of the Top Quark	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The Tevatron Electroweak Working Group, for the CDF, D0 Collaborations	Abstract:  We summarize the top-quark mass measurements from the CDF and D0 experiments at Fermilab. We combine published Run-I (1992-1996) measurements with the most recent preliminary Run-II (2001-present) measurements using up to 2.8 fb^-1 of data. Taking correlated uncertainties properly into account the resulting preliminary world average mass of the top quark is M_t = 172.4 +/- 0.7 (stat.) +/- 1.0 (syst.) GeV/c^2, assuming Gaussian systematic uncertainties. Adding in quadrature yields a total uncertainty of 1.2 GeV/c^2, corresponding to a relative precision of 0.7% on the top-quark mass. 
0808.01090	Changes in the Distribution of Income Volatility	Statistical Finance (q-fin.ST)	Authors:Shane T. Jensen, Stephen H. Shore	Abstract:  Recent research has documented a significant rise in the volatility (e.g., expected squared change) of individual incomes in the U.S. since the 1970s. Existing measures of this trend abstract from individual heterogeneity, effectively estimating an increase in average volatility. We decompose this increase in average volatility and find that it is far from representative of the experience of most people: there has been no systematic rise in volatility for the vast majority of individuals. The rise in average volatility has been driven almost entirely by a sharp rise in the income volatility of those expected to have the most volatile incomes, identified ex-ante by large income changes in the past. We document that the self-employed and those who self-identify as risk-tolerant are much more likely to have such volatile incomes; these groups have experienced much larger increases in income volatility than the population at large. These results color the policy implications one might draw from the rise in average volatility. While the basic results are apparent from PSID summary statistics, providing a complete characterization of the dynamics of the volatility distribution is a methodological challenge. We resolve these difficulties with a Markovian hierarchical Dirichlet process that builds on work from the non-parametric Bayesian statistics literature. 
0808.01091	Explosive Events and the Evolution of the Photospheric Magnetic Field	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:K. Muglach	Abstract:  Transition region explosive events have long been suggested as direct signatures of magnetic reconnection in the solar atmosphere. In seeking further observational evidence to support this interpretation, we study the relation between explosive events and the evolution of the solar magnetic field as seen in line-of-sight photospheric magnetograms. We find that about 38% of events show changes of the magnetic structure in the photosphere at the location of an explosive event over a time period of 1 h. We also discuss potential ambiguities in the analysis of high sensitivity magnetograms. 
0808.01092	The homotopy fixed point spectra of profinite Galois extensions	Algebraic Topology (math.AT)	Authors:Mark Behrens, Daniel G. Davis	Abstract:  Let E be a k-local profinite G-Galois extension of an E_infty-ring spectrum A (in the sense of Rognes). We show that E may be regarded as producing a discrete G-spectrum. Also, we prove that if E is a profaithful k-local profinite extension which satisfies certain extra conditions, then the forward direction of Rognes's Galois correspondence extends to the profinite setting. We show the function spectrum F_A((E^hH)_k, (E^hK)_k) is equivalent to the homotopy fixed point spectrum ((E[[G/H]])^hK)_k where H and K are closed subgroups of G. Applications to Morava E-theory are given, including showing that the homotopy fixed points defined by Devinatz and Hopkins for closed subgroups of the extended Morava stabilizer group agree with those defined with respect to a continuous action and in terms of the derived functor of fixed points. 
0808.01093	Quantum interference and spin-charge separation in a disordered Luttinger liquid	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:A.G. Yashenkin, I.V. Gornyi, A.D. Mirlin, D.G. Polyakov	Abstract:  We study the influence of spin on the quantum interference of interacting electrons in a single-channel disordered quantum wire within the framework of the Luttinger liquid (LL) model. The nature of the electron interference in a spinful LL is particularly nontrivial because the elementary bosonic excitations that carry charge and spin propagate with different velocities. We extend the functional bosonization approach to treat the fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom in a disordered spinful LL on an equal footing. We analyze the effect of spin-charge separation at finite temperature both on the spectral properties of single-particle fermionic excitations and on the conductivity of a disordered quantum wire. We demonstrate that the notion of weak localization, related to the interference of multiple-scattered electron waves and their decoherence due to electron-electron scattering, remains applicable to the spin-charge separated system. The relevant dephasing length, governed by the interplay of electron-electron interaction and spin-charge separation, is found to be parametrically shorter than in a spinless LL. We calculate both the quantum (weak localization) and classical (memory effect) corrections to the conductivity of a disordered spinful LL. The classical correction is shown to dominate in the limit of high temperature. 
0808.01094	Handling jets + missing E_T channel using inclusive mT2	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Mihoko M. Nojiri, Kazuki Sakurai, Yasuhiro Shimizu, Michihisa Takeuchi	Abstract:  The ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may discover the squarks (\tilde{q}) and gluino (\tilde{g}) of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) in the early stage of the experiments if their masses are lighter than 1.5 TeV. In this paper we propose the sub-system m_{T2} variable, which is sensitive to the gluino mass when m_{\tilde{q}}>m_{\tilde{g}}. Using it with the inclusive m_{T2} distribution proposed earlier, \tilde{q} and \tilde{g} masses can be determined simultaneously in the early stage of the experiments. Results of Monte Carlo simulations at sample MSSM model points are presented both for signal and background. 
0808.01095	On finite and elementary generation of SL_2(R)	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Peter Abramenko	Abstract:  Motivated by a question of A. Rapinchuk concerning general reductive groups, we are investigating the following question: Given a finitely generated integral domain $R$ with field of fractions $F$, is there a \emph{finitely generated subgroup} $Γ$ of $SL_2(F)$ containing $SL_2(R)$? We shall show in this paper that the answer to this question is negative for any polynomial ring $R$ of the form $R = R_0[s,t]$, where $R_0$ is a finitely generated integral domain with infinitely many (non--associate) prime elements. The proof applies Bass--Serre theory and reduces to analyzing which elements of $SL_2(R)$ can be generated by elementary matrices with entries in a given finitely generated $R$--subalgbra of $F$. Using Bass--Serre theory, we can also exhibit new classes of rings which do not have the $GE_2$ property introduced by P.M. Cohn. 
0808.01096	The chiral critical point of Nf=3 QCD at finite density to the order (mu/T)^4	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Philippe de Forcrand (ETH & CERN), Owe Philipsen (Muenster)    	Abstract:  QCD with three degenerate quark flavours at zero baryon density exhibits a first order thermal phase transition for small quark masses, which changes to a smooth crossover for some critical quark mass m^c_0, i.e. the chiral critical point. It is generally believed that as an (even) function of quark chemical potential, m_c(mu), the critical point moves to larger quark masses, constituting the critical endpoint of a first order phase transition in theories with m\geq m^c_0. To test this, we consider a Taylor expansion of m_c(mu) around mu=0 and determine the first two coefficients from lattice simulations with staggered fermions on N_t=4 lattices. We employ two different techniques: a) calculating the coefficients directly from a mu=0 ensemble using a novel finite difference method, and b) fitting them to simulation data obtained for imaginary chemical potentials. The mu^2 and mu^4 coefficients are found to be negative by both methods, with consistent absolute values. Combining both methods gives evidence that also the mu^6 coefficient is negative. Hence, on coarse N_t=4 lattices a three-flavour theory with m > m^c_0 does not possess a chiral critical endpoint for quark chemical potentials mu\lsim T. Simulations on finer lattices are required for reliable continuum physics. Possible implications for the QCD phase diagram are discussed.

Craig, Daniel Green	Abstract:  In conventional models of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is invariably the gravitino. However, if the supersymmetry breaking sector is strongly coupled, conformal sequestering may raise the mass of the gravitino relative to the remaining soft supersymmetry-breaking masses. In this letter, we demonstrate that such conformal dynamics in gauge-mediated theories may give rise to satisfactory neutralino dark matter while simultaneously solving the flavor and mu/ B mu problems.

Haxton	Abstract:  I discuss two of Edward Teller's contributions to nuclear physics, the introduction of the Gamow-Teller operator in beta decay and the formulation of the Goldhaber-Teller model for electric dipole transitions, in the context of efforts to understand the weak interaction and the nature of the neutrino. 
0808.01099	The TEXES Survey For H2 Emission From Protoplanetary Disks	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M.A. Bitner, M.J. Richter, J.H. Lacy, G.J. Herczeg, T.K. Greathouse, D.T. Jaffe, C. Salyk, G.A. Blake, D.J. Hollenbach, G.W. Doppmann, J.R. Najita, T. Currie	Abstract:  We report the results of a search for pure rotational molecular hydrogen emission from the circumstellar environments of young stellar objects with disks using the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES) on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and the Gemini North Observatory. We searched for mid-infrared H2 emission in the S(1), S(2), and S(4) transitions. Keck/NIRSPEC observations of the H2 S(9) transition were included for some sources as an additional constraint on the gas temperature. We detected H2 emission from 6 of 29 sources observed: AB Aur, DoAr 21, Elias 29, GSS 30 IRS 1, GV Tau N, and HL Tau. Four of the six targets with detected emission are class I sources that show evidence for surrounding material in an envelope in addition to a circumstellar disk. In these cases, we show that accretion shock heating is a plausible excitation mechanism. The detected emission lines are narrow (~10 km/s), centered at the stellar velocity, and spatially unresolved at scales of 0.4 arcsec, which is consistent with origin from a disk at radii 10-50 AU from the star. In cases where we detect multiple emission lines, we derive temperatures > 500 K from ~1 M_earth of gas. Our upper limits for the non-detections place upper limits on the amount of H2 gas with T > 500 K of less than a few Earth masses. Such warm gas temperatures are significantly higher than the equilibrium dust temperatures at these radii, suggesting that the gas is decoupled from the dust in the regions we are studying and that processes such as UV, X-ray, and accretion heating may be important. 
0808.01100	High-Redshift Galaxy Kinematics: Constraints on Models of Disk Formation	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Brant E. Robertson (1, 3), James S. Bullock (2) ((1) UChicago/KICP/EFI, (2) UC Irvine, (3) Spitzer Fellow)    	Abstract:  Integral field spectroscopy of galaxies at redshift z~2 has revealed a population of early-forming, rotationally-supported disks. These high-redshift systems provide a potentially important clue to the formation processes that build disk galaxies in the universe. A particularly well-studied example is the z=2.38 galaxy BzK-15504, which was shown by Genzel et al. (2006) to be a rotationally supported disk despite the fact that its high star formation rate and short gas consumption timescale require a very rapid acquisition of mass. Previous kinematical analyses have suggested that z~2 disk galaxies like BzK-15504 did not form through mergers because their line-of-sight velocity fields display low levels of asymmetry. We perform the same kinematical analysis on a set of simulated disk galaxies formed in gas-rich mergers of the type that may be common at high redshift, and show that the remnant disks display low velocity field asymmetry and satisfy the criteria that have been used to classify high-redshift galaxies as disks observationally. Further, we compare one of our remnants to the bulk properties of BzK-15504 and show that it has a star formation rate, gas surface density, and a circular velocity-to-velocity dispersion ratio that matches BzK-15504 remarkably well. We suggest that observations of high-redshift disk galaxies like BzK-15504 are consistent with the hypothesis that gas-rich mergers play an important role in disk formation at high redshift. 
0808.01101	Scale Dependent Galaxy Bias in the SDSS as a function of Luminosity and Colour	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:James G. Cresswell, Will J. Percival	Abstract:  It has been known for a long time that the clustering of galaxies changes as a function of galaxy type. This galaxy bias acts as a hindrance to the extraction of cosmological information from the galaxy power spectrum or correlation function. Theoretical arguments show that a change in the amplitude of the clustering between galaxies and mass on large-scales is unavoidable, but cosmological information can be easily extracted from the shape of the power spectrum or correlation function if this bias is independent of scale. Scale-dependent bias is generally small on large scales, k<0.1 h.Mpc^{-1}, but on smaller scales can affect the recovery of Ω_m.h from the measured shape of the clustering signal, and have a small effect on the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. In this paper we investigate the transition from scale-independent to scale-dependent galaxy bias as a function of galaxy population. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR5 sample to fit various models, which attempt to parametrise the turn-off from scale-independent behaviour. For blue galaxies, we find that the strength of the turn-off is strongly dependent on galaxy luminosity, with stronger scale-dependent bias on larger scales for more luminous galaxies. For red galaxies, the scale-dependence is a weaker function of luminosity. Such trends need to be modelled in order to optimally extract the information available in future surveys, and can help with the design of such surveys. 
0808.01102	Quantum Feedback Control: How to use Verification Theorems and Viscosity Solutions to Find Optimal Protocols	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Kurt Jacobs, Alireza Shabani	Abstract:  While feedback control has many applications in quantum systems, finding optimal control protocols for this task is generally challenging. So-called "verification theorems" and "viscosity solutions" provide two useful tools for this purpose: together they give a simple method to check whether any given protocol is optimal, and provide a numerical method for finding optimal protocols. While treatments of verification theorems usually use sophisticated mathematical language, this is not necessary. In this article we give a simple introduction to feedback control in quantum systems, and then describe verification theorems and viscosity solutions in simple language. We also illustrate their use with a concrete example of current interest. 
0808.01103	Velocity Statistics Distinguish Quantum Turbulence from Classical Turbulence	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:M.S. Paoletti, Michael E. Fisher, K.R. Sreenivasan, D.P. Lathrop	Abstract:  By analyzing trajectories of solid hydrogen tracers, we find that the distributions of velocity in decaying quantum turbulence in superfluid $^4$He are strongly non-Gaussian with $1/v^3$ power-law tails. These features differ from the near-Gaussian statistics of homogenous and isotropic turbulence of classical fluids. We examine the dynamics of many events of reconnection between quantized vortices and show by simple scaling arguments that they produce the observed power-law tails. 
0808.01104	Flavour Violation in Gauge-Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking Models: Experimental Constraints and Phenomenology at the LHC	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:B. Fuks (Freiburg U.), B. Herrmann (LPSC Grenoble), M. Klasen (LPSC Grenoble)    	Abstract:  We present an extensive analysis of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking models with minimal and non-minimal flavour violation. We first demonstrate that low-energy, precision electroweak, and cosmological constraints exclude large "collider-friendly" regions of the minimal parameter space. We then discuss various possibilities how flavour violation, although naturally suppressed, may still occur in gauge-mediation models. The introduction of non-minimal flavour violation at the electroweak scale is shown to relax the stringent experimental constraints, so that benchmark points, that are also cosmologically viable, can be defined and their phenomenology, i.e. squark and gaugino production cross sections with flavour violation, at the LHC can be studied. 
0808.01105	Constraining Interactions in Cosmology's Dark Sector	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Rachel Bean, Eanna E. Flanagan, Istvan Laszlo, Mark Trodden	Abstract:  We consider the cosmological constraints on theories in which there exists a nontrivial coupling between the dark matter sector and the sector responsible for the acceleration of the universe, in light of the most recent supernovae, large scale structure and cosmic microwave background data. For a variety of models, we show that the strength of the coupling of dark matter to a quintessence field is constrained to be less than 7% of the coupling to gravity. We also show that long range interactions between fermionic dark matter particles mediated by a light scalar with a Yukawa coupling are constrained to be less than 5% of the strength of gravity at a distance scale of 10 Mpc. We show that all of the models we consider are quantum mechanically weakly coupled, and argue that some other models in the literature are ruled out by quantum mechanical strong coupling. 
0808.01106	Rotation and Turbulence of the Hot ICM in Galaxy Clusters	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Taotao Fang, Philip J. Humphrey, David A. Buote (UC Irvine)    	Abstract:  Cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters typically find that the weight of a cluster at a given radius is not balanced entirely by the thermal gas pressure of the hot ICM, with theoretical studies emphasizing the role of random turbulent motions to provide the necessary additional pressure support. Using a set of high-resolution, hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters that include radiative cooling and star formation, we find instead that in the most relaxed clusters rotational support exceeds that from random turbulent motions for radii 0.1 - 0.5 r_500, and that the observed clusters are much rounder than the simulated, relaxed clusters within ~ 0.4 r_500. Moreover, while the observed clusters display an average ellipticity profile that does not vary significantly with radius, the ellipticity of the relaxed CDM clusters declines markedly with increasing radius, suggesting that the ICM of the observed clusters rotates less rapidly than that of the relaxed CDM clusters out to ~ 0.6 r_500. We also find the ellipticity profile of a simulated cluster without radiative cooling is in much better agreement with the observations, implying that over-cooling has a substantial impact on the gas dynamics and morphology out to larger radii than previously recognized. It also suggests that the 10%-20% systematic errors from non-thermal gas pressure support reported for simulated cluster masses, obtained from fitting simulated X-ray data over large radial ranges within r_500, may need to be revised downward. These results demonstrate the utility of X-ray ellipticity profiles as a probe of ICM rotation and over-cooling which should be used to constrain future cosmological cluster simulations. 
0808.01107	Semiclassical regime of Regge calculus and spin foams	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Eugenio Bianchi, Alejandro Satz	Abstract:  Recent attempts to recover the graviton propagator from spin foam models involve the use of a boundary quantum state peaked on a classical geometry. The question arises whether beyond the case of a single simplex this suffices for peaking the interior geometry in a semiclassical configuration. In this paper we explore this issue in the context of quantum Regge calculus with a general triangulation. Via a stationary phase approximation, we show that the boundary state succeeds in peaking the interior in the appropriate configuration, and that boundary correlations can be computed order by order in an asymptotic expansion. Further, we show that if we replace at each simplex the exponential of the Regge action by its cosine -- as expected from the semiclassical limit of spin foam models -- then the contribution from the sign-reversed terms is suppressed in the semiclassical regime and the results match those of conventional Regge calculus. 
0808.01108	Cache oblivious storage and access heuristics for blocked matrix-matrix multiplication	Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)	Authors:Nicolas Bock, Emanuel H. Rubensson, Paweł Sałek, Anders M. N. Niklasson, Matt Challacombe	Abstract:  We investigate effects of ordering in blocked matrix--matrix multiplication. We find that submatrices do not have to be stored contiguously in memory to achieve near optimal performance. Instead it is the choice of execution order of the submatrix multiplications that leads to a speedup of up to four times for small block sizes. This is in contrast to results for single matrix elements showing that contiguous memory allocation quickly becomes irrelevant as the blocksize increases. 
0808.01109	Simulating High-Redshift Disk Galaxies: Applications to Long Duration Gamma-Ray Burst Hosts	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Brant E. Robertson (1, 2, 3) ((1) UChicago/KICP, (3) Enrico Fermi Institute, (4) Spitzer Fellow)    	Abstract:  The efficiency of star formation governs many observable properties of the cosmological galaxy population, yet many current models of galaxy formation largely ignore the important physics of star formation and the interstellar medium (ISM). Using hydrodynamical simulations of disk galaxies that include a treatment of the molecular ISM and star formation in molecular clouds (Robertson & Kravtsov 2008), we study the influence of star formation efficiency and molecular hydrogen abundance on the properties of high-redshift galaxy populations. In this work, we focus on a model of low-mass, star forming galaxies at 1<~z<~2 that may host long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Observations of GRB hosts have revealed a population of faint systems with star formation properties that often differ from Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) and more luminous high-redshift field galaxies. Observed GRB sightlines are deficient in molecular hydrogen, but it is unclear to what degree this deficiency owes to intrinsic properties of the galaxy or the impact the GRB has on its environment. We find that hydrodynamical simulations of low-stellar mass systems at high-redshifts can reproduce the observed star formation rates and efficiencies of GRB host galaxies at redshifts 1<~z<~2. We show that the compact structure of low-mass high-redshift GRB hosts may lead to a molecular ISM fraction of a few tenths, well above that observed in individual GRB sightlines. However, the star formation rates of observed GRB host galaxies imply molecular gas masses of 10^8 - 10^9 M_sun similar to those produced in the simulations, and may therefore imply fairly large average H_2 fractions in their ISM. 
0808.01110	Bogoliubov transformations and fermion condensates in lattice field theories	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Sergio Caracciolo, Fabrizio Palumbo, Giovanni Viola	Abstract:  We apply generalized Bogoliubov transformations to the transfer matrix of relativistic field theories regularized on a lattice. We derive the conditions these transformations must satisfy to factorize the transfer matrix into two terms which propagate fermions and antifermions separately, and we solve the relative equations under some conditions. We relate these equations to the saddle point approximation of a recent bosonization method and to the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformations which separate positive from negative energy states in the Dirac Hamiltonian. 
0808.01111	Total mass biases in X-ray galaxy clusters	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Rocco Piffaretti (SISSA, Trieste), Riccardo Valdarnini (SISSA, Trieste)    	Abstract:  The exploitation of clusters of galaxies as cosmological probes relies on accurate measurements of their total gravitating mass. X-ray observations provide a powerful means of probing the total mass distribution in galaxy clusters, but might be affected by observational biases and rely on simplistic assumptions originating from our limited understanding of the intracluster medium physics. This paper is aimed at elucidating the reliability of X-ray total mass estimates in clusters of galaxies by properly disentangling various biases of both observational and physical origin. We use N-body/SPH simulation of a large sample of ~100 galaxy clusters and investigate total mass biases by comparing the mass reconstructed adopting an observational-like approach with the true mass in the simulations. X-ray surface brightness and temperature profiles extracted from the simulations are fitted with different models and adopting different radial fitting ranges in order to investigate modeling and extrapolation biases. Different theoretical definitions of gas temperature are used to investigate the effect of spectroscopic temperatures and a power ratio analysis of the surface brightness maps allows us to assess the dependence of the mass bias on cluster dynamical state. Moreover, we perform a study on the reliability of hydrostatic and hydrodynamical equilibrium mass estimates using the full three-dimensional information in the simulation.[abridged] 
0808.01112	General Matrix-Valued Inhomogeneous Linear Stochastic Differential Equations and Applications	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Jinqiao Duan, Jia-an Yan	Abstract:  The expressions of solutions for general $n\times m$ matrix-valued inhomogeneous linear stochastic differential equations are derived. This generalizes a result of Jaschke (2003) for scalar inhomogeneous linear stochastic differential equations. As an application, some $\R^n$ vector-valued inhomogeneous nonlinear stochastic differential equations are reduced to random differential equations, facilitating pathwise study of the solutions. 
0808.01113	A constructive mean field analysis of multi population neural networks with random synaptic weights and stochastic inputs	Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)	Authors:Olivier Faugeras, Jonathan Touboul, Bruno Cessac	Abstract:  We deal with the problem of bridging the gap between two scales in neuronal modeling. At the first (microscopic) scale, neurons are considered individually and their behavior described by stochastic differential equations that govern the time variations of their membrane potentials. They are coupled by synaptic connections acting on their resulting activity, a nonlinear function of their membrane potential. At the second (mesoscopic) scale, interacting populations of neurons are described individually by similar equations. The equations describing the dynamical and the stationary mean field behaviors are considered as functional equations on a set of stochastic processes. Using this new point of view allows us to prove that these equations are well-posed on any finite time interval and to provide a constructive method for effectively computing their unique solution. This method is proved to converge to the unique solution and we characterize its complexity and convergence rate. We also provide partial results for the stationary problem on infinite time intervals. These results shed some new light on such neural mass models as the one of Jansen and Rit \cite{jansen-rit:95}: their dynamics appears as a coarse approximation of the much richer dynamics that emerges from our analysis. Our numerical experiments confirm that the framework we propose and the numerical methods we derive from it provide a new and powerful tool for the exploration of neural behaviors at different scales. 
0808.01114	Holographic quark gluon plasma with flavor	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Matthias Kaminski	Abstract:  In this work I explore theoretical and phenomenological implications of chemical potentials and charge densities inside a strongly coupled thermal plasma, using the gauge/gravity correspondence. Strong coupling effects discovered in this model theory are interpreted geometrically and may be taken as qualitative predictions for heavy ion collisions at RHIC and LHC. In particular I examine the thermodynamics, spectral functions, transport coefficients and the phase diagram of the strongly coupled plasma. For example stable mesons, which are the analogs of the QCD Rho-mesons, are found to survive beyond the deconfinement transition. This paper is based on partly unpublished work performed in the context of my PhD thesis. New results and ideas extending significantly beyond those published until now are stressed. 
0808.01115	Holographic Thermodynamics and Transport of Flavor Fields	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Andy O'Bannon	Abstract:  We use gauge-gravity duality to study a strongly-coupled non-Abelian gauge theory with flavor fields, i.e. fields transforming in the fundamental representation of the gauge group. We first study the thermodynamics of the flavor fields. In the grand canonical ensemble at zero temperature, we find a second-order transition when the mass of the flavor fields equals the chemical potential. We then study the transport properties of the flavor fields at finite temperature and density. We introduce external electric and magnetic fields and compute the resulting current of flavor charge. From this current we extract the conductivity, using Ohm's law. In addition, we compute the drag force on the flavor fields at large mass, in the presence of a finite baryon density and external electric and magnetic fields. 
0808.01116	Mott Transition in the Hubbard Model on Checkerboard Lattice	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Takuya Yoshioka, Akihisa Koga, Norio Kawakami	Abstract:  We investigate the bandwidth-controlled Mott transition in the Hubbard model on the checkerboard lattice at half filling using the path-integral renormalization group (PIRG) method. It is demonstrated that the system undergoes a first-order phase transition to the plaquette-singlet insulating phase at a finite Hubbard interaction. This conclusion is drawn via a detailed analysis of the spin and charge correlations around the phase transition point by means of the PIRG method aided with a new iteration scheme introduced in this paper. 
0808.01117	Is Detection of Fitzgerald-Lorentz Contraction Possible?	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:Robert D. Klauber	Abstract:  Visual perception of Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction is known to be theoretically impossible, and this can be demonstrated pedagogically with the aid of simple spacetime diagrams of one spatial dimension. Such diagrams also demonstrate, simply and directly, that the apparent length of a moving meter stick changes as it passes by and can even look elongated. In addition, measurement of a moving meter stick with instruments, as opposed to visual perception, must be inherently ambiguous, as the length measured depends on clock synchronization, which is widely considered to be conventional. In fact, for some synchronization choices, a moving meter stick would be measured as greater than one meter. Thus, the well known Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction factor $\sqrt {1-v^2/c^2} $ would generally not be seen visually, and would only be measured in a system employing one particular (Einstein) synchronization convention. 
0808.01118	Magnetic Fields In Astrophysical Objects	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:L. J. Silvers	Abstract:  Magnetic fields are known to reside in many astrophysical objects and are now believed to be crucially important for the creation of phenomena on a wide variety of scales. However, the role of the magnetic field in the bodies that we observe has not always been clear. In certain situations, the importance of a magnetic field has been over looked on the grounds that the large-scale magnetic field was believed to be too weak to play and important role in the dynamics. In this article I discuss some of the recent developments concerning magnetic fields in stars, planets and accretion discs. I choose to emphasise some of the situations where it has been suggested that weak magnetic fields may play a more significant role than previously thought. At the end of the article I list some of the questions to be answered in the future. 
0808.01119	Graham's Schedules and the Number Partition Problem	Computational Complexity (cs.CC)	Authors:Seenu S. Reddi	Abstract:  We show the equivalence of the Number Partition Problem and the two processor scheduling problem. We establish a priori bounds on the completion times for the scheduling problem which are tighter than Graham's but almost on par with a posteriori bounds of Coffman and Sethi. We conclude the paper with a characterization of the asymptotic behavior of the scheduling problem which relates to the spread of the processing times and the number of jobs. 
0808.01120	Lattice analysis for the energy scale of QCD phenomena	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Arata Yamamoto, Hideo Suganuma	Abstract:  We formulate a new framework in lattice QCD to study the relevant energy scale of QCD phenomena. By considering the Fourier transformation of link variable, we can investigate the intrinsic energy scale of a physical quantity nonperturbatively. This framework is broadly available for all lattice QCD calculations. We apply this framework for the quark-antiquark potential and meson masses in quenched lattice QCD. The gluonic energy scale relevant for the confinement is found to be less than 1 GeV in the Landau or Coulomb gauge. 
0808.01121	Measurement of the branching fraction B(tau- --> K0 pi- nu) using the BaBar detector	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  A preliminary measurement of the branching fraction B(tau- --> K0 pi- nu) is made using 384.6 fb-1 of e+e- collision data provided by the PEP-II collider, operating primarily at sqrt(s)=10.58 GeV, and recorded using the BaBar detector. From this we measure: B(tau- --> K0 pi- nu) = (0.840 +/- 0.004 (stat) +/- 0.023 (syst)) %. This result is the most precise measurement to date and is consistent with the world average. 
0808.01122	When Clusters Collide: Constraints On Antimatter On The Largest Scales	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Gary Steigman	Abstract:  Observations have ruled out the presence of significant amounts of antimatter in the Universe on scales ranging from the solar system, to the Galaxy, to groups and clusters of galaxies, and even to distances comparable to the scale of the present horizon. Except for the model-dependent constraints on the largest scales, the most significant upper limits to diffuse antimatter in the Universe are those on the Mpc scale of clusters of galaxies provided by the EGRET upper bounds to annihilation gamma-rays from galaxy clusters whose intra-cluster gas is revealed through its x-ray emission. On the scale of individual clusters of galaxies the upper bounds to the fraction of mixed matter and antimatter for the 55 clusters from a flux-limited x-ray survey range from < 5 x 10^(-9) to < 1 x 10^(-6), strongly suggesting that individual clusters of galaxies are made entirely of matter or, of antimatter. X-ray and gamma-ray observations of colliding clusters of galaxies, such as the Bullet Cluster, permit these constraints to be extended to even larger scales. If the observations of the Bullet Cluster, where the upper bound to the antimatter fraction is found to be < 3 x 10^-6, can be generalized to other colliding clusters of galaxies, cosmologically significant amounts of antimatter will be excluded on scales of order 20 Mpc (5 x 10^(15)M_Sun). 
0808.01123	Ferromagnetism and spin polarized charge carriers in In$_{2}$O$_{3}$ thin films	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Raghava P. Panguluri, P. Kharel, C. Sudakar, R. Naik, R. Suryanarayanan, V.M. Naik, A.G. Petukhov, B. Nadgorny, G. Lawes	Abstract:  We present evidence for spin polarized charge carriers in In$_2$O$_3$ films. Both In$_2$O$_3$ and Cr doped In$_2$O$_3$ films exhibit room temperature ferromagnetism after vacuum annealing, with a saturation moment of approximately 0.5 emu/cm$^3$. We used Point Contact Andreev Reflection measurements to directly determine the spin polarization, which was found to be approximately 50$\pm$5% for both compositions. These results are consistent with suggestions that the ferromagnetism observed in certain oxide semiconductors may be carrier mediated. 
0808.01124	Top-Antitop cross section measurement in the di-lepton decay channel with ATLAS	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Duc Bao Ta, for the ATLAS collaboration	Abstract:  We present simulations of the production cross-section measurement of top-antitop pairs in the di-leptonic decay channel with the ATLAS detector. This study uses the Commissioning Service Challenge (CSC) data, which is the latest and centrally produced Monte-Carlo data set to validate the detector simulation before the actual data taking. The signal process was generated with MC@NLO and important background processes were studied. A cut and count method and two likelihood methods were employed to measure the cross section and important systematic effects were investigated. The expected statistical and systematic errors for a luminosity of 100 $\ipb$ are also given. 
0808.01125	Verified Null-Move Pruning	Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)	Authors:Omid David-Tabibi, Nathan S. Netanyahu	Abstract:  In this article we review standard null-move pruning and introduce our extended version of it, which we call verified null-move pruning. In verified null-move pruning, whenever the shallow null-move search indicates a fail-high, instead of cutting off the search from the current node, the search is continued with reduced depth. Our experiments with verified null-move pruning show that on average, it constructs a smaller search tree with greater tactical strength in comparison to standard null-move pruning. Moreover, unlike standard null-move pruning, which fails badly in zugzwang positions, verified null-move pruning manages to detect most zugzwangs and in such cases conducts a re-search to obtain the correct result. In addition, verified null-move pruning is very easy to implement, and any standard null-move pruning program can use verified null-move pruning by modifying only a few lines of code. 
0808.01126	F-term SUSY Breaking and Moduli	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Albion Lawrence	Abstract:  We discuss the coupling of heavy moduli fields to light fields when the dynamics of the latter, absent such couplings, yields metastable vacua. We show that the survival of the vacuum structure of the local model depends nontrivially on the cross-couplings of the two sectors. In particular we find that for "local" models (such as those realized by D-branes in type II string theories) with metastable vacua breaking supersymmetry via F-terms, cross-coupling of the two sectors at an intermediate scale can push the metastable vacuum outside of the regime of the effective field theory. We parametrize the region in which the metastable vacua are safe. We the show that sufficiently small cross-couplings can be made natural. Finally, we briefly discuss the role of moduli in stringy realizations of "retrofitted" SUSY-breaking sectors. 
0808.01127	Correlation functions of the energy-momentum tensor in SU(2) gauge theory at finite temperature	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:K. Huebner, F. Karsch, C. Pica	Abstract:  We calculate correlation functions of the energy-momentum tensor in the vicinity of the deconfinement phase transition of (3+1)-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory and discuss their critical behavior in the vicinity of the second order deconfinement transition. We show that correlation functions of the trace of the energy momentum tensor diverge uniformly at the critical point in proportion to the specific heat singularity. Correlation functions of the pressure, on the other hand, stay finite at the critical point. We discuss the consequences of these findings for the analysis of transport coefficients, in particular the bulk viscosity, in the vicinity of a second order phase transition point. 
0808.01128	Dynamic Connectivity: Connecting to Networks and Geometry	Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)	Authors:Timothy M. Chan, Mihai Patrascu, Liam Roditty	Abstract:  Dynamic connectivity is a well-studied problem, but so far the most compelling progress has been confined to the edge-update model: maintain an understanding of connectivity in an undirected graph, subject to edge insertions and deletions. In this paper, we study two more challenging, yet equally fundamental problems. Subgraph connectivity asks to maintain an understanding of connectivity under vertex updates: updates can turn vertices on and off, and queries refer to the subgraph induced by "on" vertices. (For instance, this is closer to applications in networks of routers, where node faults may occur.) We describe a data structure supporting vertex updates in O (m^{2/3}) amortized time, where m denotes the number of edges in the graph. This greatly improves over the previous result [Chan, STOC'02], which required fast matrix multiplication and had an update time of O(m^0.94). The new data structure is also simpler. Geometric connectivity asks to maintain a dynamic set of n geometric objects, and query connectivity in their intersection graph. (For instance, the intersection graph of balls describes connectivity in a network of sensors with bounded transmission radius.) Previously, nontrivial fully dynamic results were known only for special cases like axis-parallel line segments and rectangles. We provide similarly improved update times, O (n^{2/3}), for these special cases. Moreover, we show how to obtain sublinear update bounds for virtually all families of geometric objects which allow sublinear-time range queries, such as arbitrary 2D line segments, d-dimensional simplices, and d-dimensional balls. 
0808.01129	Local Galois Symbols on E x E	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Jacob Murre, Dinakar Ramakrishnan	Abstract:  This article is the first part of a two-part work on the Albanese kernel T_F(E x E), for an elliptic curve E over F. The main result furnishes information, for any odd prime p, about the kernel and image of the Galois symbol map from T_F(E \times E)/p to the Galois cohomology group H^2(F, E[p] (x) E[p]), for F a p-adic field and E/F ordinary, without requiring that the p-torsion points are F-rational. A key step is to show that the image is zero when the Galois module E[p] is non-semisimple. The forthcoming second part will deal with global questions. 
0808.01130	Large-wavelength instabilities in free-surface Hartmann flow at low magnetic Prandtl numbers	Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)	Authors:D. Giannakis, R. Rosner, P. Fischer	Abstract:  We study the linear stability of the flow of a viscous electrically conducting capillary fluid on a planar fixed plate in the presence of gravity and a uniform magnetic field. We first confirm that the Squire transformation for MHD is compatible with the stress and insulating boundary conditions at the free surface, but argue that unless the flow is driven at fixed Galilei and capillary numbers, the critical mode is not necessarily two-dimensional. We then investigate numerically how a flow-normal magnetic field, and the associated Hartmann steady state, affect the soft and hard instability modes of free surface flow, working in the low magnetic Prandtl number regime of laboratory fluids. Because it is a critical layer instability, the hard mode is found to exhibit similar behaviour to the even unstable mode in channel Hartmann flow, in terms of both the weak influence of Pm on its neutral stability curve, and the dependence of its critical Reynolds number Re_c on the Hartmann number Ha. In contrast, the structure of the soft mode's growth rate contours in the (Re, alpha) plane, where alpha is the wavenumber, differs markedly between problems with small, but nonzero, Pm, and their counterparts in the inductionless limit. As derived from large wavelength approximations, and confirmed numerically, the soft mode's critical Reynolds number grows exponentially with Ha in inductionless problems. However, when Pm is nonzero the Lorentz force originating from the steady state current leads to a modification of Re_c(Ha) to either a sublinearly increasing, or decreasing function of Ha, respectively for problems with insulating and conducting walls. In the former, we also observe pairs of Alfven waves, the upstream propagating wave undergoing an instability at large Alfven numbers. 
0808.01131	Correlated pressure effects on structure and superconductivity in LaFeAsO0.9F0.1	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:G. Garbarino, P. Toulemonde, M. Alvarez-Murga, A. Sow, M. Mezouar, M. Nunez-Regueiro	Abstract:  We have studied the structural and superconductivity properties of the compound LaFeAsO0.9F0.1 under pressures up to 32GPa using synchrotron radiation and diamond anvil cells. We obtain an ambient pressure bulk modulus K_0 = 78(2)GPa, compressibility comparable to some cuprates. At high pressures, the sample is in the overdoped region, with a linear decrease with pressure variation of the superconducting transition temperature. 
0808.01132	Kinetic energy sum spectra in nonmesonic weak decay of hypernuclei	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Cesar Barbero, Alfredo P. Galeao, Mahir S. Hussein, Francisco Krmpotic	Abstract:  We evaluate the coincidence spectra in the nonmesonic weak decay (NMWD) $ΛN\go nN$ of $Λ$ hypernuclei $^{4}_Λ$He, $^{5}_Λ$He, $^{12}_Λ$C, $^{16}_Λ$O, and $^{28}_Λ$Si, as a function of the sum of kinetic energies $E_{nN}=E_n+E_N$ for $N=n,p$. The strangeness-changing transition potential is described by the one-meson-exchange model, with commonly used parameterization. Two versions of the Independent-Particle Shell Model (IPSM) are employed to account for the nuclear structure of the final residual nuclei. They are: (a) IPSM-a, where no correlation, except for the Pauli principle, is taken into account, and (b) IPSM-b, where the highly excited hole states are considered to be quasi-stationary and are described by Breit-Wigner distributions, whose widths are estimated from the experimental data. All $np$ and $nn$ spectra exhibit a series of peaks in the energy interval 110 MeV $<E_{nN}<170$ MeV, one for each occupied shell-model state. The IPSM-a could be a pretty fair approximation for the light $^{4}_Λ$He and $^{5}_Λ$He hypernuclei. For the remaining, heavier, hypernuclei it is very important, however, to take into account the spreading in strength of the deep-hole states, and bring into play the IPSM-b approach. Notwithstanding the nuclear model that is employed the results depend only very weakly on the details of the dynamics involved in the decay process proper. We propose that the IPSM is the appropriate lowest-order approximation for the theoretical calculations of the of kinetic energy sum spectra in the NMWD. It is in comparison to this picture that one should appraise the effects of the final state interactions and of the two-nucleon-induced decay mode. 
0808.01133	Universal bounds and semiclassical estimates for eigenvalues of abstract Schroedinger operators	Spectral Theory (math.SP)	Authors:Evans M. Harrell II, Joachim Stubbe	Abstract:  We prove trace inequalities for a self-adjoint operator on an abstract Hilbert space. These inequalities lead to universal bounds on spectral gaps and on moments of eigenvalues lambda_k that are analogous to those known for Schroedinger operators and the Dirichlet Laplacian, on which the operators of interest are modeled. In addition we produce inequalities that are new even in the model case. These include a family of differential inequalities for generalized Riesz means and theorems stating that arithmetic means of lambda_k^p for p <= 3 are universally bounded from above by multiples of the geometric mean of the lambda_k. For Schroedinger operators and the Dirichlet Laplacian these bounds are Weyl-sharp, i.e., saturated by the standard semiclassical estimates for lambda_k at large k. 
0808.01134	A biophysical model of prokaryotic diversity in geothermal hot springs	Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)	Authors:Anna Klales, James Duncan, Elizabeth Janus Nett, Suzanne Amador Kane (Physics Department, Haverford College, Haverford PA)    	Abstract:  Recent field investigations of photosynthetic bacteria living in geothermal hot spring environments have revealed surprisingly complex ecosystems, with an unexpected level of genetic diversity. One case of particular interest involves the distribution along hot spring thermal gradients of genetically distinct bacterial strains that differ in their preferred temperatures for reproduction and photosynthesis. In such systems, a single variable, temperature, defines the relevant environmental variation. In spite of this, each region along the thermal gradient exhibits multiple strains of photosynthetic bacteria adapted to several distinct thermal optima, rather than the expected single thermal strain adapted to the local environmental temperature. Here we analyze microbiology data from several ecological studies to show that the thermal distribution field data exhibit several universal features independent of location and specific bacterial strain. These include the distribution of optimal temperatures of different thermal strains and the functional dependence of the net population density on temperature. Further, we present a simple population dynamics model of these systems that is highly constrained by biophysical data and by physical features of the environment. This model can explain in detail the observed diversity of different strains of the photosynthetic bacteria. It also reproduces the observed thermal population distributions, as well as certain features of population dynamics observed in laboratory studies of the same organisms. 
0808.01135	Functional gradients through the cortex, multisensory integration and scaling laws in brain dynamics	Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)	Authors:Isabel Gonzalo-Fonrodona	Abstract:  In the context of the increasing number of works on multisensory and cross-modal effects in cerebral processing, a review is made on the functional model of human brain proposed by Justo Gonzalo (1910-1986), in relation to what he called central syndrome (caused by unilateral lesion in the parieto-occipital cortex, equidistant from the visual, tactile and auditory projection areas). The syndrome is featured by a bilateral, symmetric and multisensory involvement, and by a functional depression with dynamic effects dependent on the neural mass lost and related to physiological laws of nervous excitability. Inverted or tilted vision as well as tactile and auditive inversion, under minimum stimulus, appears as a stage of incomplete integration, being almost corrected under higher stimulus or facilitation by multisensory integration. The syndrome reveals aspects of the brain dynamics that suggest a functional continuity and unity of the cortex. A functional gradients scheme was proposed in which the specificity of the cortex is distributed with a continuous variation. This syndrome is interpreted as a scale reduction in the nervous excitability of the system, the different sensory qualities being affected allometricaly according to scaling laws. A continuity from lower to higher sensory functions was proposed. The sensory growth by an increase of the stimulus or by multisensory facilitation is found to follow approximately power laws, that would reflect basic laws of biological neural networks. We restrict the analysis to the visual system. 
0808.01136	Thermal strain-induced enhancement of electromagnetic properties in SiC-MgB2 composites	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:R. Zeng S.X. Dou, L. Lu, W. X. Li, J.H. Kim, P. Munroe, R.K. Zheng, S.P. Ringer	Abstract:  Strain engineering has been used to modify materials properties in ferroelectric, superconducting, and ferromagnetic thin films. The advantage of strain engineering is that it can achieve unexpected enhancement in certain properties, such as an increase in ferroelectric critical temperature, Tc, by 300 to 500K, with a minimum detrimental effect on the intrinsic properties of the material. The strain engineering has been largely applied to the materials in thin film form, where the strain is generated as a result of lattice mismatch between the substrate and component film or between layers in multilayer structures. Here, we report the observation of residual thermal stress/strain in dense SiC-MgB2 superconductor composites prepared by a diffusion method. We demonstrate that the thermal strain caused by the different thermal expansion coefficients between the MgB2 and SiC phases is responsible for the significant improvement in the critical current density, Jc, the irreversibility field, Hirr, and the upper critical field, Hc2, in the SiC-MgB2 composite where the carbon substitution level is low. In contrast to the common practice of improving the Jc and Hc2 of MgB2 through chemical substitution, by taking advantage of residual thermal strains we are able to design a composite, which shows only a small drop in Tc and little increase in resistivity, but a significant improvement over the Jc and Hc2 of MgB2. The present findings open up a new direction for manipulation of materials properties through strain engineering for materials in various forms. 
0808.01137	Lawson Method for Obtaining Wave Functions and $g$ Factors of Ar Isotopes	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:L. Zamick, S. Yeager, Y. Y. Sharon	Abstract:  Lawson has shown that one can obtain sensible wave functions even in the weak deformation limit of the Nilsson model as long as one projects out states of good total angular momentum. We apply this method to obtain wave functions and magnetic $g$ factors of excited states of select even-even Ar isotopes. 
0808.01138	A Complete Grammar for Decomposing a Family of Graphs into 3-connected Components	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Guillaume Chapuy, Eric Fusy, Mihyun Kang, Bilyana Shoilekova	Abstract:  Tutte has described in the book "Connectivity in graphs" a canonical decomposition of any graph into 3-connected components. In this article we translate (using the language of symbolic combinatorics) Tutte's decomposition into a general grammar expressing any family of graphs (with some stability conditions) in terms of the 3-connected subfamily. A key ingredient we use is an extension of the so-called dissymmetry theorem, which yields negative signs in the grammar. As a main application we recover in a purely combinatorial way the analytic expression found by Giménez and Noy for the series counting labelled planar graphs (such an expression is crucial to do asymptotic enumeration and to obtain limit laws of various parameters on random planar graphs). Besides the grammar, an important ingredient of our method is a recent bijective construction of planar maps by Bouttier, Di Francesco and Guitter.

0808.01140	The Micro-Arcsecond Scintillation-Induced Variability (MASIV) Survey II: The First Four Epochs	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. E. J. Lovell, B. J. Rickett, J-P. Macquart, D. L. Jauncey, H. E. Bignall, L. Kedziora-Chudczer, R. Ojha, T. Pursimo, M. Dutka, C. Senkbeil, S. Shabala	Abstract:  We report on the variability of 443 flat spectrum, compact radio sources monitored using the VLA for 3 days in 4 epochs at ~ 4 month intervals at 5 GHz as part of the Micro-Arcsecond Scintillation-Induced Variability (MASIV) survey. Over half of these sources exhibited 2-10% rms variations on timescales over 2 days. We analyzed the variations by two independent methods, and find that the rms variability amplitudes of the sources correlate with the emission measure in the ionized Interstellar Medium along their respective lines of sight. We thus link the variations with interstellar scintillation of components of these sources, with some (unknown) fraction of the total flux density contained within a compact region of angular diameter in the range 10-50 micro-arcseconds. We also find that the variations decrease for high mean flux density sources and, most importantly, for high redshift sources. The decrease in variability is probably due either to an increase in the apparent diameter of the source, or a decrease in the flux density of the compact fraction beyond z ~ 2. Here we present a statistical analysis of these results, and a future paper will the discuss the cosmological implications in detail. 
0808.01141	Scaling limit for subsystems and Doplicher-Roberts reconstruction	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Roberto Conti, Gerardo Morsella	Abstract:  Given an inclusion $B \subset F$ of (graded) local nets, we analyse the structure of the corresponding inclusion of scaling limit nets $B_0 \subset F_0$, giving conditions, fulfilled in free field theory, under which the unicity of the scaling limit of $F$ implies that of the scaling limit of $B$. As a byproduct, we compute explicitly the (unique) scaling limit of the fixpoint nets of scalar free field theories. In the particular case of an inclusion $A \subset B$ of local nets with the same canonical field net $F$, we find sufficient conditions which entail the equality of the canonical field nets of $A_0$ and $B_0$.

Hochsch.), Zong-Guo Si (Shandong U.)    	Abstract:  We report on our recent work on electroweak corrections to $t\bar{t}$ production at hadron colliders. Specifically, we discuss the weak-interaction contributions to the top quark transverse momentum and $t \bar{t}$ invariant mass distributions and an induced parity-violating top-spin asymmetry. 
0808.01143	The effect of gluon condensate on holographic heavy quark potential	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Youngman Kim, Bum-Hoon Lee, Chanyong Park, Sang-Jin Sin	Abstract:  The gluon condensate is very sensitive to the QCD deconfinement transition since its value changes drastically with the deconfinement transition. We calculate the gluon condensate dependence of the heavy quark potential in AdS/CFT to study how the property of the heavy quarkonium is affected by a relic of the deconfinement transition. We observe that the heavy quark potential becomes deeper as the value of the gluon condensate decreases. We interpret this as a dropping of the heavy quarkonium mass just above the deconfinement transition, which is similar to the results obtained from QCD sum rule and from a bottom-up AdS/QCD model. 
0808.01144	Yukawa Interactions and Supersymmetric Electroweak Baryogenesis	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Daniel J. H. Chung, Bjorn Garbrecht, Michael J. Ramsey-Musolf, Sean Tulin	Abstract:  We analyze the quantum transport equations for supersymmetric electroweak baryogenesis including previously neglected bottom and tau Yukawa interactions and show that they imply the presence of a previously unrecognized dependence of the cosmic baryon asymmetry on the spectrum of third generation quark and lepton superpartners. For fixed values of the CP-violating phases in the supersymmetric theory, the baryon asymmetry can vary in both magnitude and sign as a result of the squark and slepton mass dependence. For light, right-handed top and bottom quark superpartners, the baryon number creation can be driven primarily by interactions involving third generation leptons and their superpartners. 
0808.01145	Bulk viscosity and r-modes of neutron stars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Debarati Chatterjee, Debades Bandyopadhyay	Abstract:  The bulk viscosity due to the non-leptonic process involving hyperons in $K^-$ condensed matter is discussed here. We find that the bulk viscosity is modified in a superconducting phase. Further, we demonstrate how the exotic bulk viscosity coefficient influences $r$-modes of neutron stars which might be sources of detectable gravitational waves. 
0808.01146	Biflatness and biprojectivity of the Fourier algebra	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Volker Runde	Abstract:  We show that the biflatness - in the sense of A. Ya. Helemskii - of the Fourier algebra $A(G)$ of a locally compact group $G$ forces $G$ to either have an abelian subgroup of finite index or to be non-amenable without containing $F_2$, the free group in two generators, as a closed subgroup. An analogous dichotomy is obtained for biprojectivity. 
0808.01147	Sufficient and Necessary Condition of Separability for Generalized Werner States	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Dong-Ling Deng, Jing-Ling Chen	Abstract:  We introduce a sufficient and necessary condition for the separability of a specific class of $N$ $d$-dimensional system (qudits) states, namely special generalized Werner state (SGWS): $W^{[d^N]}(v)=(1-v)\frac{I^{(N)}}{d^N}+v|ψ _d^N><ψ_d^N|$, where $ |ψ_d^N>=\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}α_i|i... i>$ is an entangled pure state of $N$ qudits system and $α_i$ satisfys two restrictions: (i) $\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}α_iα_i^*=1$; (ii) Matrix $\frac{1}{d}(I^{(1)}+\mathcal{T}\sum_{i\neq j}α_i|i>< j|α_j^*)$, where $\mathcal{T}=\texttt{Min}_{i\neq j}\{1/|α_iα_j|\}$, is a density matrix. Our condition gives quite a simple and efficiently computable way to judge whether a given SGWS is separable or not and previously known separable conditions are shown to be special cases of our approach. 
0808.01148	Avalanche-Induced Current Enhancement in Semiconducting Carbon Nanotubes	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Albert Liao, Yang Zhao, Eric Pop	Abstract:  Semiconducting carbon nanotubes under high electric field stress (~10 V/um) display a striking, exponential current increase due to avalanche generation of free electrons and holes. Unlike in other materials, the avalanche process in such 1D quantum wires involves access to the third sub-band, is insensitive to temperature, but strongly dependent on diameter ~exp(-1/d^2). Comparison with a theoretical model yields a novel approach to obtain the inelastic optical phonon emission length, L_OP,ems ~ 15d nm. The combined results underscore the importance of multi-band transport in 1D molecular wires. 
0808.01149	Relations among conditional probabilities	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Jason Morton	Abstract:  We describe a Groebner basis of relations among conditional probabilities in a discrete probability space, with any set of conditioned-upon events. They may be specialized to the partially-observed random variable case, the purely conditional case, and other special cases. We also investigate the connection to generalized permutohedra and describe a conditional probability simplex.

0808.01151	VLBI Astrometry of AGB Variables with VERA -- A Semiregular Variable S Crateris --	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Akiharu Nakagawa, Miyuki Tsushima, Kazuma Ando, Takeshi Bushimata, Yoon Kyung Choi, Tomoya Hirota, Mareki Honma, Hiroshi Imai, Kenzaburo Iwadate, Takaaki Jike, Seiji Kameno, Osamu Kameya, Ryuichi Kamohara, Yukitoshi Kan-Ya, Noriyuki Kawaguchi, Masachika Kijima, Mi Kyoung Kim, Hideyuki Kobayashi, Seisuke Kuji, Tomoharu Kurayama, Toshihisa Maeda, Seiji Manabe, Kenta Maruyama, Makoto Matsui, Naoko Matsumoto, Takeshi Miyaji, Takumi Nagayama, Kayoko Nakamura, Daisuke Nyu, Chung Sik Oh, Toshihiro Omodaka, Tomoaki Oyama, Nicolas Pradel, Satoshi Sakai, Tetsuo Sasao, Katsuhisa Sato, Mayumi Sato, Katsunori M. Shibata, Hiroshi Suda, Yoshiaki Tamura, Kousuke Ueda, Yuji Ueno, Kazuyoshi Yamashita	Abstract:  We present a distance measurement for the semiregular variable S Crateris (S Crt) based on its annual parallax. With the unique dual beam system of the VLBI Exploration for Radio Astrometry (VERA) telescopes, we measured the absolute proper motion of a water maser spot associated with S Crt, referred to the quasar J1147-0724 located at an angular separation of 1.23$^{\circ}$. In observations spanning nearly two years, we have detected the maser spot at the LSR velocity of 34.7 km s$^{-1}$, for which we measured the annual parallax of 2.33$\pm$0.13 mas corresponding to a distance of 430$^{+25}_{-23}$ pc. This measurement has an accuracy one order of magnitude better than the parallax measurements of HIPPARCOS. The angular distribution and three-dimensional velocity field of maser spots indicate a bipolar outflow with the flow axis along northeast-southwest direction. Using the distance and photospheric temperature, we estimate the stellar radius of S Crt and compare it with those of Mira variables. 
0808.01152	Charged Black Holes in Phantom Cosmology	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Mubasher Jamil, Muneer Ahmad Rashid, Asghar Qadir	Abstract:  In the classical relativistic regime, the accretion of phantom-like dark energy onto a stationary black hole reduces the mass of black hole. Here we have investigated the accretion of phantom energy onto a stationary charged black hole and have determined the condition under which this accretion is possible. This condition restricts the mass to charge ratio in a narrow limit. This condition also challenges the validity of the cosmic censorship conjecture since a naked singularity is eventually produced as magnitude of charge increases compared to mass of black hole. 
0808.01153	In-medium modification of P-wave charmonia from QCD sum rules	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Young-Ho Song, Su Houng Lee, Kenji Morita	Abstract:  We investigate the changes of the masses and widths of $χ_{c0}$ and $χ_{c1}$ in hot gluonic matter near $T_c$ and in nuclear medium using QCD sum rules. As in the previous works for the $J/ψ$ and $η_c$, in-medium effects are incorporated through the changes of gluon condensates. Twist-2 terms for the $^3 P_0 (χ_{c0})$ and $^3 P_1 (χ_{c1})$ are also included for the first time. The results show that larger mass shifts and width broadenings take place as compared to the $S$-wave states. As the critical change take place near $T_c$, related measurements can reveal critical phenomenon in QCD. 
0808.01154	Elastic flexibility, fast-ion conduction, boson and floppy modes in AgPO3-AgI glasses examined in Raman scattering, IR reflectance, MDSC, ac electrical conductivity and molar volume experiments	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:Deassy I. Novita, P. Boolchand, Mohammed Malki, Matthieu Micoulaut	Abstract:  Raman scattering, IR reflectance and modulated DSC measurements are performed on specifically prepared dry (AgI)x(AgPO3)1-x glasses over a wide range of compositions 0 < x < 0.60. A reversibility window is observed in the 0.095< x < 0.378 range, which fixes the elastically rigid but unstressed regime also known as the Intermediate Phase. Glass compositions at x < 0.095 are stressed-rigid, while those at x > 0.378 elastically flexible. Raman optical elasticity power-laws, trends in the nature of the glass transition endotherms corroborate the three elastic phase assignments. Ionic conductivities reveal a step-like increase when glasses become stress-free at x > xc(1) = 0.095, and a logarithmic increase in conductivity (sigma ~ (x-xc(2)t) once they become flexible at x > xc(2) = 0.378 with a power-law t = 1.78. The power-law is consistent with percolation of 3D filamentary conduction pathways. Traces of water doping lower Tg and narrow the reversibility window, and can also completely collapse it. Ideas on network flexibility promoting ion-conduction are in harmony with the unified approach of Ingram et al., who have emphasized the similarity of process compliance or elasticity relating to ion-transport and structural relaxation in decoupled systems. Boson mode frequency and scattering strength display thresholds that coincide with the two elastic phase boundaries. In particular, the scattering strength of the boson mode increases almost linearly with glass composition x, with a slope that tracks the floppy mode fraction as a function of mean coordination number r predicted by mean-field rigidity theory. These data suggest that the excess low frequency vibrations contributing to boson mode in flexible glasses come largely from floppy modes. 
0808.01155	Loop series expansion with propagation diagrams	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Yusuke Watanabe, Kenji Fukumizu	Abstract:  The Bethe approximation is a successful method for approximating partition functions of probabilistic models associated with a graph. Recently, Chertkov and Chernyak derived an interesting formula called Loop Series Expansion, which is an expansion of the partition function. The main term of the series is the Bethe approximation while other terms are labelled by subgraphs called generalized loops. In this paper, we derive a loop series expansion of binary pairwise Markov random fields with propagation diagrams, which describe rules how first messages and secondary messages propagate. Our approach allows to express the Loop Series in the form of a polynomial with coefficients positive integers. Using the propagation diagrams, we establish a new formula that shows a relation between the exact marginal probabilities and their Bethe approximations. 
0808.01156	On algebraic models of relativistic scattering	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:G. A. Kerimov, A. Ventura	Abstract:  In this paper we develop an algebraic technique for building relativistic models in the framework of direct-interaction theories. The interacting mass operator M in the Bakamjian-Thomas construction is related to a quadratic Casimir operator C of a non-compact group G. As a consequence, the S matrix can be gained from an intertwining relation between Weyl-equivalent representations of G. The method is illustrated by explicit application to a model with SO(3,1) dynamical symmetry. 
0808.01157	Enumeration of $(k,2)$-noncrossing partitions	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Toufik Mansour, Simone Severini	Abstract:  A set partition is said to be $(k,d)$-noncrossing if it avoids the pattern $12... k12... d$. We find an explicit formula for the ordinary generating function of the number of $(k,d)$-noncrossing partitions of $\{1,2,...,n\}$ when $d=1,2$. 
0808.01158	Chemistry of layered d-metal pnictide oxides and their potential as candidates for new superconductors	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Tadashi C. Ozawa, Susan M. Kauzlarich	Abstract:  Layered d-metal pnictide oxides are a unique class of compounds which consists of characteristic d-metal pnictide layers and metal oxide layers. More than 100 of these layered compounds, including the recently discovered Fe-based superconducting pnictide oxides, can be classified into 9 structure types. These structure types and the chemical and physical properties of the characteristic d-metal pnictide layers and metal oxide layers of the layered d-metal pnictide oxides are reviewed and discussed. Furthermore, possible approaches to design new superconductors based on these layered d-metal pnictide oxides are proposed. 
0808.01159	Effect of material stiffness on hardness: a computational study based on model potentials	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Gerolf Ziegenhain, Herbert M. Urbassek	Abstract:  We investigate the dependence of the hardness of materials on their elastic stiffness. This is possible by constructing a series of model potentials of the Morse type; starting on modelling natural Cu, the model potential exhibit an increased elastic modulus, while keeping all other potential parameters (lattice constant, bond energy) unchanged. Using molecular-dynamics simulation, we perform nanoindentation experiments on these model crystals. We find that the crystal hardness scales with the elastic stiffness. Also the load drop, which is experienced when plasticity sets in, increases in proportion to the elastic stiffness, while the yield point, i.e., the indentation at which plasticity sets in, is independent of the elastic stiffness. 
0808.01160	Nonlinear Optical Response Functions of Mott Insulators Based on Dynamical Mean Field Approximation	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Takanobu Jujo	Abstract:  We investigate the nonlinear optical susceptibilities of Mott insulators with the dynamical mean field approximation. The two-photon absorption (TPA) and the third-harmonic generation (THG) spectra are calculated, and the classification by the types of coupling to external fields shows different behavior from conventional semiconductors. The direct transition terms are predominant both in the TPA and THG spectra, and the importance of taking all types of interaction with the external field into account is illustrated in connection with the THG spectrum and dcKerr effect. The dependence of the TPA and THG spectra on the Coulomb interaction indicate a scaling relation. We apply this relation to the quantitative evaluation and obtain results comparable to those of experiments. 
0808.01161	Testing backreaction effects with observations	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Julien Larena, Jean--Michel Alimi, Thomas Buchert, Martin Kunz, Pier-Stefano Corasaniti	Abstract:  In order to quantitatively test the ability of averaged inhomogeneous cosmologies to correctly describe observations of the large scale properties of the Universe, we introduce a smoothed template metric corresponding to a constant spatial curvature model at any time, but with an evolving curvature parameter. This metric is used to compute quantities along an approximate effective lightcone of the averaged model of the Universe. As opposed to the standard Friedmann model, we parameterize this template metric by exact scaling properties of an averaged inhomogeneous cosmology, and we also motivate this form of the metric by results on a geometrical smoothing of inhomogeneous cosmological hypersurfaces. We test our hypothesis for the template metric against supernova data and the position of the CMB peaks, and infer the goodness--of--fit and parameter uncertainties. We find that averaged inhomogeneous models can reproduce the observations without requiring an additional Dark Energy component (though a volume acceleration is still needed), and that current data do not disfavour our main assumption on the effective lightcone structure. We also show that the experimental uncertainties on the angular diameter distance and the Hubble parameter from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations measurements -- forseen in future surveys like the proposed EUCLID satellite project -- are sufficiently small to distinguish between a FLRW template geometry and the template geometry with consistently evolving curvature.

0808.01162	New Insight into the Properties of Proton Conducting Oxides from Neutron Total Scattering	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Lorenzo Malavasi, Hyunjeong Kim, Thomas Proffen, Giorgio Flor	Abstract:  In this paper we investigated the most important family of proton conducting oxides, i.e. cerates, by means of pair distribution function analysis (PDF) obtained from total neutron scattering data. The results clearly demonstrates that the local structure plays a fundamental role in the protonation process. Oxygen vacancy creation by acceptor doping reduces the local structure symmetry which is then restored upon water uptake. This mechanism mainly involves the Ba-O shell which flexibility seems to be at the basis of the proton conduction mechanism, thus providing a direct insight on the design of optimal proton conducting materials. 
0808.01163	Photoemission signatures of valence-bond stripes in cuprates: Long-range vs. short-range order	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Alexander Wollny, Matthias Vojta	Abstract:  Recent experiments indicate that the tendency toward the formation of unidirectional charge density waves ("stripes") is common to various underdoped cuprates. We discuss momentum-resolved spectral properties of valence-bond stripes, comparing the situations of ideal and short-range stripe order, the latter being relevant for weak and/or disorder-pinned stripes. We find clear signatures of ordered stripes, although matrix element effects suppress most shadow band features. With decreasing stripe correlation length, stripe signatures are quickly washed out, the only remaining effect being a broadening of antinodal quasiparticles. This insensitivity of photoemission to short-range stripe order may be employed to distinguish it from nematic order, e.g. in underdoped YBCO. 
0808.01164	A trivial formalization of the theory of grossone	General Mathematics (math.GM)	Authors:A. E. Gutman, S. S. Kutateladze	Abstract:  A trivial formalization is given for the informal reasonings presented in a series of papers by Ya.D.Sergeyev on a positional numeral system with an infinitely large base, grossone; the system which is groundlessly opposed by its originator to the classical nonstandard analysis. 
0808.01165	Baryon octupole moments	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:A.J. Buchmann, E.M. Henley	Abstract:  We report on a calculation of higher electromagnetic multipole moments of baryons in a non-covariant quark model approach. The employed method is based on the underlying spin-flavor symmetry of the strong interaction and its breaking.We present results on magnetic octupole moments of decuplet baryons and discuss their implications. 
0808.01166	Heat flow on Finsler manifolds	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Shin-ichi Ohta, Karl-Theodor Sturm	Abstract:  We present two approaches to the heat flow on a Finsler manifold $(M,F)$: either as gradient flow on $L^2(M,m)$ for the energy; or as gradient flow on the reverse $L^2$-Wasserstein space $\mathcal{P}_2(M)$ of probability measures on $M$ for the relative entropy. Both approaches depend on the choice of a measure $m$ on $M$ and then lead to the same nonlinear evolution semigroup. We prove $\mathcal{C}^{1,α}$-regularity for solutions to the (nonlinear) heat equation on the Finsler space $(M,F,m)$. Typically, solutions to the heat equation will not be $\mathcal{C}^2$. Moreover, we derive pointwise comparison results a la Cheeger-Yau and integrated upper Gaussian estimates a la Davies. 
0808.01167	Rank of 3-tensors with 2 slices and Kronecker canonical forms	Rings and Algebras (math.RA)	Authors:Toshio Sumi, Mitsuhiro Miyazaki, Toshio Sakata	Abstract:  Tensor type data are becoming important recently in various application fields. We determine a rank of a tensor T so that A+T is diagonalizable for a given 3-tensor A with 2 slices over the complex and real number field. 
0808.01168	Curvaton Dynamics and the Non-Linearity Parameters in Curvaton Model	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Qing-Guo Huang, Yi Wang	Abstract:  We investigate the curvaton dynamics and the non-linearity parameters in curvaton model with potential slightly deviating from the quadratic form in detail. The non-linearity parameter $g_{NL}$ will show up due to the curvaton self-interaction. We also point out that the leading order of non-quadratic term in the curvaton potential can be negative, for example in the axion-type curvaton model. If a large positive $g_{NL}$ is detected, the axion-type curvaton model will be preferred. 
0808.01169	Fano-like Anti-resonances in Nanomechanical and Optomechanical Systems	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:D. A. Rodrigues	Abstract:  We study a resonator coupled to a generic detector and calculate the noise spectra of the two sub-systems. We describe the coupled system by a closed, linear, set of Langevin equations and derive a general form for the finite frequency noise of both the resonator and the detector. The resonator spectrum is the well-known thermal form with an effective damping, frequency shift and diffusion term. In contrast, the detector noise shows a rather striking Fano-like resonance, i.e. there is a resonance at the renormalized frequency, and an anti-resonance at the bare resonator frequency. As examples of this effect, we calculate the spectrum of a normal state single electron transistor coupled capacitively to a resonator and of a cavity coupled parametrically to a resonator. 
0808.01170	Hole spin relaxation in $p$-type GaAs quantum wires	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:C. Lü, U. Zülicke, M. W. Wu	Abstract:  We investigate the spin relaxation of $p$-type GaAs quantum wires by numerically solving the fully microscopic kinetic spin Bloch equations. We find that the quantum-wire size influences the spin relaxation time effectively by modulating the energy spectrum and the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing of wire states. The effects of quantum-wire size, temperature, hole density, and initial polarization are investigated in detail. We show that, depending on the situation, the spin relaxation time can either increase or decrease with hole density. Due to the different subband structure and effects arising from spin-orbit coupling, many spin-relaxation properties are quite different from those of holes in the bulk or in quantum wells, and the inter-subband scattering makes a marked contribution to the spin relaxation. 
0808.01171	Oscillations of the large-scale circulation in turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection: the off-center mode and its relationship with the torsional mode	Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)	Authors:Quan Zhou, Heng-Dong Xi, Sheng-Qi Zhou, Chao Sun, Ke-Qing Xia	Abstract:  We report an experimental study of the large-scale circulation (LSC) in a turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection cell with aspect ratio unity. The temperature-extremum-extraction (TEE) method for obtaining the dynamic information of the LSC is presented. With this method, the azimuthal angular positions of the hot ascending and cold descending flows along the sidewall are identified from the measured instantaneous azimuthal temperature profile. The motion of the LSC is then decomposed into two different modes: the azimuthal mode and the translational or off-center mode. Comparing to the previous sinusoidal-fitting (SF) method, it is found that both methods give the same information about the azimuthal motion of the LSC, but the TEE method in addition can provide information about the off-center motion of the LSC, which is found to oscillate time-periodically around the cell's central vertical axis with an amplitude being nearly independent of the turbulent intensity. It is further found that the azimuthal angular positions of the hot ascending flow near the bottom plate and the cold descending flow near the top plate oscillate periodically out of phase by $π$, leading to the torsional mode of the LSC. These oscillations are then propagated vertically along the sidewall by the hot ascending and cold descending fluids. When they reach the mid-height plane, the azimuthal positions of the hottest and coldest fluids again oscillate out of phase by $π$. It is this out-of-phase horizontal positional oscillation of the hottest and coldest fluids at the same horizontal plane that produces the off-center oscillation of the LSC. A direct velocity measurement further confirms the existence of the bulk off-center mode of the flow field near cell center. 
0808.01172	GRB 060206: hints of precession of the central engine?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:X.W. Liu, X.F. Wu, T. Lu	Abstract:  Aims. The high-redshift (z = 4:048) gamma-ray burst GRB 060206 showed unusual behavior, with a significant rebrightening by a factor of ~ 4 at about 3000 s after the burst. We argue that this rebrightening implies that the central engine became active again after the main burst produced by the first ejecta, then drove another more collimated jet-like ejecta with a larger viewing angle. The two ejecta both interacted with the ambient medium, giving rise to forward shocks that propagated into the ambient medium and reverse shocks that penetrated into the ejecta. The total emission was a combination of the emissions from the reverse- and forward- shocked regions. We discuss how this combined emission accounts for the observed rebrightening. Methods. We apply numerical models to calculate the light curves from the shocked regions, which include a forward shock originating in the first ejecta and a forward-reverse shock for the second ejecta. Results. We find evidence that the central engine became active again 2000 s after the main burst. The combined emission produced by interactions of these two ejecta with the ambient medium can describe the properties of the afterglow of this burst. We argue that the rapid rise in brightness at ~ 3000 s in the afterglow is due to the off-axis emission from the second ejecta. The precession of the torus or accretion disk of the central engine is a natural explanation for the departure of the second ejecta from the line of sight. 
0808.01173	Frame and wavelet systems on the sphere	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Margit Pap (P\'ecs, Hungary)    	Abstract:  In this paper we formulate a weighted version of minimum problem (1.4) on the sphere and we show that, for $K\le L$, if $\set{φ_k}^K_{k=1}$ consists of the spherical functions with degree less than $N$ we can localize the points $(ξ_1,...,ξ_L)$ on the sphere so that the solution of this problem is the simplest possible. This localization is connected to the discrete orthogonality of the spherical functions which was proved in [3]. Using these points we construct a frame system and a wavelet system on the sphere and we study the properties of these systems. For $K>L$ a similar construction was made in paper [4], but in that case the solution of the minimum problem (1.4) is not as efficient as it is in our case. The analogue of Fejér and de la Valée-Poussin summation methods introduced in [3] can be expressed by the frame system introduced in this paper. 
0808.01174	Orbital ordering in undoped manganites via a generalized Peierls instability	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:S. Yarlagadda, P. B. Littlewood, M. Mitra, R. K. Monu	Abstract:  We study the ground state orbital ordering of $LaMnO_3$, at weak electron-phonon coupling, when the spin state is A-type antiferromagnet. We determine the orbital ordering by extending to our Jahn-Teller system a recently developed Peierls instability framework for the Holstein model [1]. By using two-dimensional dynamic response functions corresponding to a mixed Jahn-Teller mode, we establish that the $Q_2$ mode determines the orbital order. 
0808.01175	Theory of defect production in nonlinear quench across a quantum critical point	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Shreyoshi Mondal, K. Sengupta, Diptiman Sen	Abstract:  We study defect production in a quantum system subjected to a nonlinear power law quench which takes it either through a quantum critical or multicritical point or along a quantum critical line. We elaborate on our earlier work [D. Sen, K. Sengupta, S. Mondal, \prl 101, 016806 (2008)] and present a detailed analysis of the scaling of the defect density $n$ with the quench rate $τ$ and exponent $\al$ for each of the above-mentioned cases. We also compute the correlation functions for defects generated in nonlinear quenches through a quantum critical point and discuss the dependence of the amplitudes of such correlation functions on the exponent $\al$. We discuss several experimental systems where these theoretical predictions can be tested. 
0808.01176	The maximal number of exceptional Dehn surgeries	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Marc Lackenby, Robert Meyerhoff	Abstract:  We prove two conjectures of C. Gordon. We show that the maximal number of exceptional Dehn surgeries on a 1-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold is 10, and that the maximal intersection number between exceptional slopes is 8. The proof uses a combination of new geometric techniques and a rigorous computer-assisted calculation. 
0808.01177	Microscopic concavity and fluctuation bounds in a class of deposition processes	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:M. Balázs, J. Komjáthy, T. Seppäläinen	Abstract:  We prove fluctuation bounds for the particle current in totally asymmetric zero range processes in one dimension with nondecreasing, concave jump rates whose slope decays exponentially. Fluctuations in the characteristic directions have order of magnitude $t^{1/3}$. This is in agreement with the expectation that these systems lie in the same KPZ universality class as the asymmetric simple exclusion process. The result is via a robust argument formulated for a broad class of deposition-type processes. Besides this class of zero range processes, hypotheses of this argument have also been verified in the authors' earlier papers for the asymmetric simple exclusion and the constant rate zero range processes, and are currently under development for a bricklayers process with exponentially increasing jump rates. 
0808.01178	On the Time Dependent Gross Pitaevskii- and Hartree Equation	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Peter Pickl	Abstract:  We are interested in solutions $Ψ_t$ of the Schrödinger equation of $N$ interacting bosons under the influence of a time dependent external field, where the range and the coupling constant of the interaction scale with $N$ in such a way, that the interaction energy per particle stays more or less constant. Let $\mathcal{N}^{φ_0}$ be the particle number operator with respect to some $φ_0\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{C})$. Assume that the relative particle number of the initial wave function $N^{-1}< Ψ_0,\mathcal{N}^{φ_0}Ψ_0>$ converges to one as $N\to\infty$. We shall show that we can find a $φ_t\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{C})$ such that $\lim_{N\to\infty}N^{-1}< Ψ_t,\mathcal{N}^{φ_t}Ψ_t>=1$ and that $φ_t$ is -- dependent of the scaling of the range of the interaction -- solution of the Gross-Pitaevskii or Hartree equation. We shall also show that under additional decay conditions of $φ_t$ the limit can be taken uniform in $t<\infty$ and that convergence of the relative particle number implies convergence of the $k$-particle density matrices of $Ψ_t$. 
0808.01179	Heat conductivity from molecular chaos hypothesis in locally confined billiard systems	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Thomas Gilbert, Raphael Lefevere	Abstract:  We study the transport properties of a large class of locally confined Hamiltonian systems, in which neighboring particles interact through hard core elastic collisions. When these collisions become rare and the systems large, we derive a Boltzmann-like equation for the evolution of the probability densities. We solve this equation in the linear regime and compute the heat conductivity from a Green-Kubo formula. The validity of our approach is demonstated by comparing our predictions to the results of numerical simulations performed on a new class of high-dimensional defocusing chaotic billiards. 
0808.01180	A Pilot Survey of HI in Field Galaxies at Redshift z~0.2	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Barbara Catinella, Martha P. Haynes, Riccardo Giovanelli, Jeffrey P. Gardner, Andrew J. Connolly	Abstract:  We present the first results of a targeted survey carried out with the 305 m Arecibo telescope to detect HI-line emission from galaxies at redshift z>0.16. The targets, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey database, are non-interacting disk galaxies in relatively isolated fields. We present here the HI spectra and derived HI parameters for ten objects detected in this pilot program. All are massive disk galaxies in the redshift interval 0.17-0.25 (i.e. 2-3 Gyr look-back time), with HI masses M_HI=3-8 x 10^10 Msun and high gas mass fractions (HI - to - stellar mass ratios ~10-30%). Our results demonstrate the efficacy of exploiting Arecibo's large collecting area to measure the HI mass and rotational velocity of galaxies above redshift z=0.2. In particular, this sample includes the highest redshift detections of HI emission from individual galaxies made to date. Extension of this pilot program will allow us to study the HI properties of field galaxies at cosmological distances, thus complementing ongoing radio synthesis observations of cluster samples at z~0.2. 
0808.01181	Analog Grover search by adiabatic passage in a cavity-laser-atom system	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:D. Daems, S. Guérin	Abstract:  A physical implementation of the adiabatic Grover search is theoretically investigated in a system of N identical three-level atoms trapped in a single mode cavity. Some of the atoms are marked through the presence of an energy gap between their two ground states. The search is controlled by two partially delayed lasers which allow a deterministic adiabatic transfer from an initially entangled state to the marked states. Pulse schemes are proposed to satisfy the Grover speedup either exactly or approximately, and the success rate of the search is calculated.

Here, we present the Colour-Magnitude Diagrams(CMDs) resulting from HST/ACS photometry, aimed at deriving the star formation history (SFH) in six fields of the SMC. The fields are located in the central regions, in the stellar halo, and in the wing toward the LMC. The CMDs are very deep, well beyond the oldest Main Sequence Turn-Off, and will allow us to derive the SFH over the entire Hubble time. 
0808.01183	Thorough analysis of the Oseen system in 2D exterior domains	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Paweł Konieczny	Abstract:  We construct $L_p$-estimates for the inhomogeneous Oseen system studied in a two dimensional exterior domain $Ω$ with inhomogeneous slip boundary conditions. The kernel of the paper is a result for the half space $\mathbb{R}^2_+$. Analysis of this model system shows us a parabolic character of the studied problem, resulting as an appearance of the wake region behind the obstacle. Main tools are given by the Fourier analysis to obtain the maximal regularity estimates. The results imply the solvability for the Navier-Stokes system for small velocity at infinity. 
0808.01184	The GRB-Supernova Connection	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Li-Xin Li	Abstract:  Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to be produced by the core collapse of massive stars and hence to be connected with supernovae (SNe). Indeed, for four pairs of GRBs and SNe, spectroscopically confirmed connection has been firmly established. For more than a dozen of GRBs the SN signature (the `red bump') has been detected in the afterglow lightcurves. Based on the four pairs of GRBs and SNe with spectroscopically confirmed connection a tight correlation was found between the peak spectral energy of GRBs and the peak bolometric luminosity of the underlying SNe. The recent discovery of X-ray flash 080109 associated with a normal core-collapse SN 2008D confirmed this relation and extended the GRB-SN connection. Progress on the GRB-SN connection is briefly reviewed. 
0808.01185	Manifolds with weighted Poincaré inequality and uniqueness of minimal hypersurfaces	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Xu Cheng, Detang Zhou	Abstract:  In this paper, we obtain results on rigidity of complete Riemannian manifolds with weighted Poincaré inequality. As an application, we prove that if $M$ is a complete $\frac{n-2}{n}$-stable minimal hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ with $n\geq 3$ and has bounded norm of the second fundamental form, then $M$ must either have only one end or be a catenoid. 
0808.01186	Molecular Gas in NUclei of GAlaxies (NUGA). X. The Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 3147	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:V. Casasola (1,2,4), F. Combes (2), S. Garcia-Burillo (3), L. K. Hunt (4), S. Leon (5), A. J. Baker (6) ((1) Padova University, (2) Obs. de Paris LERMA, (3) OAN Madrid, (4) INAF/IRA Firenze, (5) CSIC Granada, (6) Dept. Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Rutgers, Piscataway)    	Abstract:  We present CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) observations of the SA(rs)bc Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 3147, obtained with the IRAM interferometer at 1\farcs9 $\times$1\farcs6 and 1\farcs6 $\times$1\farcs4 resolutions, respectively. A central peak seen mainly in CO(2-1) and a ring-like structure at $r \simeq 10$\arcsec $\sim$2 kpc dominate the CO maps. In CO(1-0) an outer spiral at $r \simeq 20$\arcsec $\sim$4 kpc is also detected, not visible in CO(2-1) emission because it falls outside the field-of-view of the primary beam. The kinematics of the molecular structures are quite regular, although there is evidence for local non-circular or streaming motions. We show that the molecular gas distribution is similar but not exactly identical to those of star formation tracers. Using a NIR image obtained with adaptive optics at the CFHT Telescope, we identify a weak bar in NGC 3147, which is classified as non-barred galaxy in the optical. We then compute the gravity torques exerted by this stellar bar on the gas. We find that the gas inside the inner CO ring is subject to a net negative torque and loses angular momentum. This is expected for gas at the UHR, just inside the corotation resonance of the stellar bar. In contrast, the gas outside corotation, in the spiral arms comprising the outer spiral structure, suffers positive torques and is driven outwards. We conclude that some molecular gas is presently flowing into the central region, since we find negative torques down to the resolution limit of our images. 
0808.01187	On approximability by embeddings of cycles in the plane	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Mikhail Skopenkov	Abstract:  We obtain a criterion for approximability by embeddings of piecewise linear maps of a circle to the plane, analogous to the one proved by Minc for maps of a segment to the plane. Theorem. Let S be a triangulation of a circle with s vertices. Let f be a simplicial map of the graph S to the plane. The map f is approximable by embeddings if and only if for each i=0,...,s the i-th derivative of the map f (defined by Minc) neither contains transversal self-intersections nor is the standard winding of degree greater than 1. We deduce from the Minc result the completeness of the van Kampen obstruction to approximability by embeddings of piecewise linear maps of a segment to the plane. We also generalize these criteria to simplicial maps of a graph without vertices of degree >3 to a circle. 
0808.01188	Quadrupole Stark Effect in Superfluid	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:L.A. Melnikovsky	Abstract:  The roton energy depends on applied electric field gradient due to its quadrupole moment. This may explain absorption line splitting recently observed experimentally. 
0808.01189	Interpolation sequences for the Bernstein algebra	Complex Variables (math.CV)	Authors:Xavier Massaneda, Joaquim Ortega-Cerdà	Abstract:  We give a description, in analytic and geometric terms, of the interpolation sequences for the algebra of entire functions of exponential type which are bounded on the real line. 
0808.01190	Restricted Open-Shell Kohn-Sham Theory IV: Expressions for N Unpaired Electrons	Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)	Authors:Marius Schulte, Irmgard Frank	Abstract:  We present an energy expression for restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham theory for N unpaired electrons and single-electron operators for all multiplets formed from up to five unpaired electrons. It is shown that it is possible to derive an explicit energy expression for all low-spin multiplets of systems that exhibit neither radial nor cylindrical symmetry. 
0808.01191	Smoothing effects of dispersive equations on real rank one symmetric spaces	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Koichi Kaizuka	Abstract:  In this article we prove time-global smoothing effects of dispersive pseudodifferential equations with constant coefficient radially symmetric symbols on real rank one symmetric spaces of noncompact type. We also discuss gain of regularities according to decay rates of initial values for the Schroedinger evolution equation. We introduce some isometric operators and reduce the arguments to the well-known Euclidean case. In our proof, Helgason's Fourier transform and the Radon transform as an elliptic Fourier integral operator play crucial roles. 
0808.01192	Electronic states and pairing symmetry in the two-dimensional 16 band d-p model for iron-based superconductor	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Y. Yanagi, Y. Yamakawa, Y. Ōno	Abstract:  The electronic states of the FeAs plane in iron-based superconductors are investigated on the basis of the two-dimensional 16-band d-p model, where the tight-binding parameters are determined so as to fit the band structure obtained by the density functional calculation for LaFeAsO. The model includes the Coulomb interaction on a Fe site: the intra- and inter-orbital direct terms U and U', the exchange coupling J and the pair-transfer J'. Within the random phase approximation (RPA), we discuss the pairing symmetry of possible superconducting states including s-wave and d-wave pairing on the U'-J plane. 
0808.01193	Charged membrane as a source for repulsive gravity	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:V. Belinski, M. Pizzi, A. Paolino	Abstract:  We demonstrate an alternative (with respect to the ones existing in literature) and more habitual for physicists derivation of exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations for the motion of a charged spherical membrane with tangential tension. We stress that the physically acceptable range of parameters for which the static and stable state of the membrane producing the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) repulsive gravity effect exists. The concrete realization of such state for the Nambu-Goto membrane is described. The point is that membrane are able to cut out the central naked singularity region and at the same time to join in appropriate way the RN repulsive region. As result we have a model of an everywhere-regular material source exhibiting a repulsive gravitational force in the vicinity of its surface: this construction gives a more sensible physical status to the RN solution in the naked singularity case. 
0808.01194	A fractional diffusion equation for two-point probability distributions of a continuous-time random walk	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:A. Baule, R. Friedrich	Abstract:  Continuous time random walks are non-Markovian stochastic processes, which are only partly characterized by single-time probability distributions. We derive a closed evolution equation for joint two-point probability density functions of a subdiffusive continuous time random walk, which can be considered as a generalization of the known single-time fractional diffusion equation to two-time probability distributions. The solution of this generalized diffusion equation is given as an integral transformation of the probability distribution of an ordinary diffusion process, where the integral kernel is generated by an inverse Lévy stable process. Explicit expressions for the two time moments of a diffusion process are given, which could be readily compared with the ones determined from experiments. 
0808.01195	Dynamics of path aggregation in the presence of turnover	Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)	Authors:Debasish Chaudhuri, Peter Borowski, P. K. Mohanty, Martin Zapotocky	Abstract:  We investigate the slow time scales that arise from aging of the paths during the process of path aggregation. This is studied using Monte-Carlo simulations of a model aiming to describe the formation of fascicles of axons mediated by contact axon-axon interactions. The growing axons are represented as interacting directed random walks in two spatial dimensions. To mimic axonal turnover, random walkers are injected and whole paths of individual walkers are removed at specified rates. We identify several distinct time scales that emerge from the system dynamics and can exceed the average axonal lifetime by orders of magnitude. In the dynamical steady state, the position-dependent distribution of fascicle sizes obeys a scaling law. We discuss our findings in terms of an analytically tractable, effective model of fascicle dynamics. 
0808.01196	Coupling MOAO with Integral Field Spectroscopy: specifications for the VLT and the E-ELT	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Puech, H. Flores, M. Lehnert, B. Neichel, T. Fusco, P. Rosati, J.-G. Cuby, G. Rousset	Abstract:  [Abridged] We have developed an end-to-end simulation to specify the science requirements of a MOAO-fed integral field spectrograph on either an 8m or 42m telescope. Our simulations re-scales observations of local galaxies or results from numerical simulations of disk or interacting galaxies. For the current analysis, we limit ourselves to a local disk galaxy which exhibits simple rotation and a simulation of a merger. We have attempted to generalize our results by introducing the simple concepts of "PSF contrast" which is the amount of light polluting adjacent spectra which we find drives the smallest EE at a given spatial scale. The choice of the spatial sampling is driven by the "scale-coupling", i.e., the relationship between the IFU pixel scale and the size of the features that need to be recovered by 3D spectroscopy in order to understand the nature of the galaxy and its substructure. Because the dynamical nature of galaxies are mostly reflected in their large-scale motions, a relatively coarse spatial resolution is enough to distinguish between a rotating disk and a major merger. Although we used a limited number of morpho-kinematic cases, our simulations suggest that, on a 42m telescope, the choice of an IFU pixel scale of 50-75 mas seems to be sufficient. Such a coarse sampling has the benefit of lowering the exposure time to reach a specific signal-to-noise as well as relaxing the performance of the MOAO system. On the other hand, recovering the full 2D-kinematics of z~4 galaxies requires high signal-to-noise and at least an EE of 34% in 150 mas (2 pixels of 75 mas). Finally, we carried out a similar study at z=1.6 with a MOAO-fed spectrograph for an 8m, and find that at least an EE of 30% at 0.25 arcsec spatial sampling is required to understand the nature of disks and mergers. 
0808.01197	Radiation damage in biological material: electronic properties and electron impact ionization in urea	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:C. Caleman, C. Ortiz, E. Marklund, F. Bultmark, M. Gabrysch, F. G. Parak, J. Hajdu, M. Klintenberg, N. Timneanu	Abstract:  Radiation damage is an unavoidable process when performing structural investigations of biological macromolecules with X-ray sources. In crystallography this process can be limited through damage distribution in a crystal, while for single molecular imaging it can be outrun by employing short intense pulses. Secondary electron generation is crucial during damage formation and we present a study in urea, as model for biomaterial. From first principles we calculate the band structure and energy loss function, and subsequently the inelastic electron cross section in urea. Using Molecular Dynamics simulations, we quantify the damage and study the magnitude and spatial extent of the electron cloud coming from an incident electron, as well as the dependence with initial energy. 
0808.01198	Spectral properties of interacting magnetoelectric particles	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:E. O. Kamenetskii	Abstract:  The linear magnetoelectric (ME) effect provides a special route for linking magnetic and electric properties. In microwaves, a local ME effect appears due to the dynamical symmetry breakings of magnetic-dipolar modes (MDMs) in a ferrite disk particle. The fact that for MDMs in a ferrite disk one has evident both classical and quantum-like attributes, puts special demands on the methods used for study of interacting ME particles. A proper model for coupled particles should be based on the spectral characteristics of MDM oscillations and an analysis of the overlap integrals for interacting eigen oscillating ME elements. In this paper, we present theoretical studies of spectral properties of literally coupled of MDM ME disks. We show that there exists the "exchange" mechanism of interaction between the particles, which is distinctive from the magnetostatic interaction between magnetic dipoles. The spectral method proposed in this paper may further the development of a theory of ME "molecules" and realization of local ME composites. 
0808.01199	Embedding products of graphs into Euclidean spaces	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Mikhail Skopenkov	Abstract:  For any collection of graphs we find the minimal dimension d such that the product of these graphs is embeddable into the d-dimensional Euclidean space. In particular, we prove that the n-th powers of the Kuratowsky graphs are not embeddable into the 2n-dimensional Euclidean space. This is a solution of a problem of Menger from 1929. The idea of the proof is the reduction to a problem from so-called Ramsey link theory: we show that any embedding of L into the (2n-1)-dimensional sphere, where L is the join of n copies of a 4-point set, has a pair of linked (n-1)-dimensional spheres. 
0808.01200	Observation of the 5p Rydberg states of sulfur difluoride radical by resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization spectroscopy	Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)	Authors:Qun Zhang, Xiaoguo Zhou, Quanxin Li, Shuqin Yu, Xingxiao Ma	Abstract:  Sulfur difluoride radicals in their ground state have been produced by a "laser-free" pulsed dc discharge of the SF$_{6}$/Ar gas mixtures in a supersonic molecular beam and detected by mass-selective resonance-enhanced multilphoton ionization (REMPI) spectroscopy in the wavelength range of 408 - 420 nm. Analyses of the (3 + 1) REMPI excitation spectrum have enabled identification of three hitherto unknown Rydberg states of this radical. Following the Rydberg state labeling in our previous work [see J. Phys. Chem. A 102, 7233 (1998)], these we label the K(5p$_{1}$) [$nu_{0-0}$ = 71 837 cm$^{-1}$, $omega_{1}^{'}$(a$_{1}$ sym str) = 915 cm$^{-1}$], L(5p$_{2}$) [$nu_{0-0}$ = 72 134 cm$^{-1}$, $omega_{1}^{'}$(a$_{1}$ sym str) = 912 cm$^{-1}$], and M(5p$_{3}$) [$nu_{0-0}$ = 72 336 cm$^{-1}$, $omega_{1}^{'}$(a$_{1}$ sym str) = 926 cm$^{-1}$] Rydberg states, respectively. [Origins, relative to the lowest vibrational level of the X$^{1}$A$_{1}$ ground state, and vibrational frequencies of the symmetric S-F stretching mode are suggested by the numbers in brackets.] Photofragmentation process of SF$_{2}$$^{+}$--SF$^{+}$ + F that relates to the REMPI spectrum was discussed. 
0808.01201	Balanced Hermitian metrics from SU(2)-structures	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Marisa Fernández, Adriano Tomassini, Luis Ugarte, Raquel Villacampa	Abstract:  We study the intrinsic geometrical structure of hypersurfaces in 6-manifolds carrying a balanced Hermitian SU(3)-structure, which we call {\em balanced} SU(2)-{\em structures}. We provide conditions which imply that such a 5-manifold can be isometrically embedded as a hypersurface in a manifold with a balanced SU(3)-structure. We show that any 5-dimensional compact nilmanifold has an invariant balanced SU(2)-structure as well as new examples of balanced Hermitian SU(3)-metrics constructed from balanced SU(2)-structures. Moreover, for $n=3,4$, we present examples of compact manifolds, endowed with a balanced SU(n)-structure, such that the corresponding Bismut connection has holonomy equal to SU(n). 
0808.01202	Equidistribution of the Fekete points on the sphere	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Jordi Marzo, Joaquim Ortega-Cerdà	Abstract:  The Fekete points are the points that maximize a Vandermonde-type determinant that appears in the polynomial Lagrange interpolation formula. They are well suited points for interpolation formulas and numerical integration. We prove the asymptotic equidistribution of the Fekete points in the sphere. The way we proceed is by showing their connection with other array of points, the Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund arrays and the interpolating arrays, that have been studied recently. 
0808.01203	Hydrogen/silicon complexes in silicon from computational searches	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Andrew J. Morris, Chris J. Pickard, R. J. Needs	Abstract:  Defects in crystalline silicon consisting of a silicon self-interstitial atom and one, two, three, or four hydrogen atoms are studied within density-functional theory (DFT). We search for low-energy defects by starting from an ensemble of structures in which the atomic positions in the defect region have been randomized. We then relax each structure to a minimum in the energy. We find a new defect consisting of a self-interstitial and one hydrogen atom (denoted by {I,H}) which has a higher symmetry and a lower energy than previously reported structures. We recover the {I,H_2} defect found in previous studies and confirm that it is the most stable such defect. Our best {I,H_3} defect has a slightly different structure and lower energy than the one previously reported, and our lowest energy {I,H_4} defect is different to those of previous studies. 
0808.01204	The cohomology of lattices in SL(2,C)	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Tobias Finis, Fritz Grunewald, Paulo Tirao	Abstract:  This paper contains both theoretical results and experimental data on the behavior of the dimensions of the cohomology spaces H^1(G,E_n), where Gamma is a lattice in SL(2,C) and E_n is one of the standard self-dual modules. In the case Gamma = SL(2,O) for the ring of integers O in an imaginary quadratic number field, we make the theory of lifting explicit and obtain lower bounds linear in n. We have accumulated a large amount of experimental data in this case, as well as for some geometrically constructed and mostly non-arithmetic groups. The computations for SL(2,O) lead us to discover two instances with non-lifted classes in the cohomology. We also derive an upper bound of size O(n^2 / log n) for any fixed lattice Gamma in the general case. We discuss a number of new questions and conjectures suggested by our results and our experimental data. 
0808.01205	On the General Nature of Physical Objects and their Interactions, as Suggested by the Properties of Argumentally-Coupled Oscillating Systems	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:Danil Doubochinski, Jonathan Tennenbaum	Abstract:  The work reported here originates in the discovery, four decades ago, of a previously unknown type of self-organizing interaction among oscillating systems -- so-called argumental interactions -- and of "quantized" modes of behavior in macroscopic argumentally-coupled oscillators, having no equivalent in the classical theory of oscillations. Recently the present authors have been jointly pursuing new lines of investigation into argumental interactions and their possible significance for the foundations of physics. Among other things, the study of argumentally-coupled oscillators suggested to the authors a new general way of looking at physical objects, their interactions and their aggregative,"social" behavior as manifested on all scales of observation. We believe this new viewpoint, which differs significantly both from that of classical physics and from quantum theory as presently understood, might lead to a more coherent understanding of many natural phenomena which until now have been studied only in a piecemeal fashion. To make the authors' train of thought intelligible to the reader not familiar with the field of argumental interactions, we have combined the presentation of our ideas with an extended review of experimental and theoretical results on argumentally-coupled oscillators and the associated "Macroscopic Quantization Effect". Our review serves the additional purpose of introducing this little-known, but most interesting field of research to a broader scientific audience. 
0808.01206	Abrahamse's interpolation theorem and Fuchsian groups	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Mrinal Raghupathi	Abstract:  We generalize Abrahamse's interpolation theorem from the setting of a multiply connected domain to that of a more general Riemann surface. Our main result provides the scalar-valued interpolation theorem for the fixed-point subalgebra of $H^\infty$ associated to the action of a Fuchsian group. We rely on two results from a paper of Forelli. This allows us to prove the interpolation result using duality techniques that parallel Sarason's approach to the interpolation problem for $H^\infty$. In this process we prove a more general distance formula, very much like Nehari's theorem, and obtain relations between the kernel function for the character automorphic Hardy spaces and the Szegö kernel for the disk. Finally, we examine our interpolation results in the context of the two simplest examples of Fuchsian groups acting on the disk. 
0808.01207	Optimally Efficient Prefix Search and Multicast in Structured P2P Networks	Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)	Authors:Dirk Bradler, Jussi Kangasharju, Max Muehlhaeuser	Abstract:  Searching in P2P networks is fundamental to all overlay networks. P2P networks based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) are optimized for single key lookups, whereas unstructured networks offer more complex queries at the cost of increased traffic and uncertain success rates. Our Distributed Tree Construction (DTC) approach enables structured P2P networks to perform prefix search, range queries, and multicast in an optimal way. It achieves this by creating a spanning tree over the peers in the search area, using only information available locally on each peer. Because DTC creates a spanning tree, it can query all the peers in the search area with a minimal number of messages. Furthermore, we show that the tree depth has the same upper bound as a regular DHT lookup which in turn guarantees fast and responsive runtime behavior. By placing objects with a region quadtree, we can perform a prefix search or a range query in a freely selectable area of the DHT. Our DTC algorithm is DHT-agnostic and works with most existing DHTs. We evaluate the performance of DTC over several DHTs by comparing the performance to existing application-level multicast solutions, we show that DTC sends 30-250% fewer messages than common solutions. 
0808.01208	Physics of collisionless phase mixing	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:D. Tsiklauri, T. Haruki	Abstract:  Previous studies of phase mixing of ion cyclotron (IC), Alfvénic, waves in the collisionless regime have established the generation of parallel electric field and hence acceleration of electrons in the regions of transverse density inhomogeneity. However, outstanding issues were left open. Here we use 2.5D, relativistic, fully electromagnetic PIC (Particle-In-Cell) code and an analytic MHD (Magnetohydrodynamic) formulation, to establish the following points: (i) Using the generalised Ohm's law we find that the parallel electric field is supported mostly by the electron pressure tensor, with a smaller contribution from the electron inertia term. (ii) The generated parallel electric field and the fraction of accelerated electrons are independent of the IC wave frequency remaining at a level of six orders of magnitude larger than the Dreicer value and approximately 20% respectively. The generated parallel electric field and the fraction of accelerated electrons increase with the increase of IC wave amplitude. The generated parallel electric field seems to be independent of plasma beta, while the fraction of accelerated electrons strongly increases with the decrease of plasma beta (for plasma beta of 0.0001 the fraction of accelerated electrons can be as large as 47%). (iii) In the collisionless regime IC wave dissipation length (that is defined as the distance over which the wave damps) variation with the driving frequency shows a deviation from the analytical MHD result, which we attribute to a possible frequency dependence of the effective resistivity. (iv) Effective anomalous resistivity, inferred from our numerical simulations, is at least four orders of magnitude larger than the classical Spitzer value. 
0808.01209	On the Pontryagin-Steenrod-Wu theorem	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Dušan Repovš, Mikhail Skopenkov, Fulvia Spaggiari	Abstract:  This paper is on homotopy classification of maps of (n+1)-dimensional manifolds into the n-dimensional sphere. For a continuous map f of an (n+1)-manifold into the n-sphere define the degree deg f to be the class dual to f^*[S^n], where [S^n] is the fundamental class. We present a short and direct proof of the following specific case of the Pontryagin-Steenrod-Wu theorem: Theorem. Let M be a connected orientable closed smooth (n+1)-manifold, n>2. Then the map deg:π^n(M)\to H_1(M;Z) is 1-to-1 (i.e., bijective), if the product w_2(M) x r_2 H_2(M;Z) is nonzero, where r_2 is the mod2 reduction; 2-to-1 (i.e., each element of H_1(M;Z) has exactly 2 preimages) - otherwise. The proof is based on the Pontryagin-Thom construction and a geometric definition of the Stiefel-Whitney classes w_2(M). 
0808.01210	Improving Wang-Landau sampling with adaptive windows	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:A. G. Cunha-Netto, A. A. Caparica, Shan-Ho Tsai, Ronald Dickman, D. P. Landau	Abstract:  Wang-Landau sampling (WLS) of large systems requires dividing the energy range into "windows" and joining the results of simulations in each window. The resulting density of states (and associated thermodynamic functions) are shown to suffer from boundary effects in simulations of lattice polymers and the five-state Potts model. Here, we implement WLS using adaptive windows. Instead of defining fixed energy windows (or windows in the energy-magnetization plane for the Potts model), the boundary positions depend on the set of energy values on which the histogram is flat at a given stage of the simulation. Shifting the windows each time the modification factor f is reduced, we eliminate border effects that arise in simulations using fixed windows. Adaptive windows extend significantly the range of system sizes that may be studied reliably using WLS. 
0808.01211	Commonsense Knowledge, Ontology and Ordinary Language	Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)	Authors:Walid S. Saba	Abstract:  Over two decades ago a "quite revolution" overwhelmingly replaced knowledgebased approaches in natural language processing (NLP) by quantitative (e.g., statistical, corpus-based, machine learning) methods. Although it is our firm belief that purely quantitative approaches cannot be the only paradigm for NLP, dissatisfaction with purely engineering approaches to the construction of large knowledge bases for NLP are somewhat justified. In this paper we hope to demonstrate that both trends are partly misguided and that the time has come to enrich logical semantics with an ontological structure that reflects our commonsense view of the world and the way we talk about in ordinary language. In this paper it will be demonstrated that assuming such an ontological structure a number of challenges in the semantics of natural language (e.g., metonymy, intensionality, copredication, nominal compounds, etc.) can be properly and uniformly addressed. 
0808.01212	Gravity in the 3+1-Split Formalism I: Holography as an Initial Value Problem	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Diego S. Mansi, Anastasios C. Petkou, Giovanni Tagliabue	Abstract:  We present a detailed analysis of the 3+1-split formalism of gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant. The formalism helps revealing the intimate connection between holography and the initial value formulation of gravity. We show that the various methods of holographic subtraction of divergences correspond just to different transformations of the canonical variables, such that the initial value problem is properly set up at the boundary. The renormalized boundary energy momentum tensor is a component of the Weyl tensor. 
0808.01213	Gravity in the 3+1-Split Formalism II: Self-Duality and the Emergence of the Gravitational Chern-Simons in the Boundary	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Diego S. Mansi, Anastasios C. Petkou, Giovanni Tagliabue	Abstract:  We study self-duality in the context of the 3+1-split formalism of gravity with non-zero cosmological constant. Lorentzian self-dual configurations are conformally flat spacetimes and have boundary data determined by classical solutions of the three-dimensional gravitational Chern-Simons. For Euclidean self-dual configurations, the relationship between their boundary initial positions and initial velocity is also determined by the three-dimensional gravitational Chern-Simons. Our results imply that bulk self-dual configurations are holographically described by the gravitational Chern-Simons theory which can either viewed as a boundary generating functional or as a boundary effective action. 
0808.01214	Investigation of the kinetic equation of cascade fragmentation theory at not self-similar subdivision	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:R. E. Brodskii, Yu P. Virchenko	Abstract:  The cascade kinetic fragmentation process of solids is investigated when the condition probability density of splinter formation do not depends on time and has the property $P(ρ, r, t) = P(ρ/r)$. It is obtained the evolution equation for the probability distribution density in terms of its Mellin transformation. In the particular case $P(ρ/r) = C (ρ/r)^α$, the limit solution of this equation at $t \to \infty$ is found. It differs essentially from the Kolmogorov law. 
0808.01215	A Formal Foundation for XrML	Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)	Authors:Joseph Y. Halpern, Vicky Weissman	Abstract:  XrML is becoming a popular language in industry for writing software licenses. The semantics for XrML is implicitly given by an algorithm that determines if a permission follows from a set of licenses. We focus on a fragment of the language and use it to highlight some problematic aspects of the algorithm. We then correct the problems, introduce formal semantics, and show that our semantics captures the (corrected) algorithm. Next, we consider the complexity of determining if a permission is implied by a set of XrML licenses. We prove that the general problem is undecidable, but it is polynomial-time computable for an expressive fragment of the language. We extend XrML to capture a wider range of licenses by adding negation to the language. Finally, we discuss the key differences between XrML and MPEG-21, an international standard based on XrML. 
0808.01216	On the mean square of the error term for the two-dimensional divisor problems(II)	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Xiaodong Cao, Wenguang Zhai	Abstract:  Let $Δ(a,b;x)$ denote the error term of the general two-dimensional divisor problem. In this paper we shall study the relation between the discrete mean value $\sum_{n\leq T}Δ^2(a,b;n)$ and the continuous mean value $\int_1^TΔ^2(a,b;x)dx$. 
0808.01217	A short proof of the Twelve points theorem	Metric Geometry (math.MG)	Authors:Matija Cencelj, Dušan Repovš, Mikhail Skopenkov	Abstract:  We present a short elementary proof of the following Twelve Points Theorem: Let M be a convex polygon with vertices at the lattice points, containing a single lattice point in its interior. Denote by m (resp. m*) the number of lattice points in the boundary of M (resp. in the boundary of the dual polygon). Then m+m*=12. 
0808.01218	Resonant Excitation of Disk Oscillations in Deformed Disks III: Revision of Mathematical Treatment	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Shoji Kato	Abstract:  In previous studies, we have examined a resonant excitation of disk oscillations in deformed disks. In these studies, however, mathematical treatment around the resonant points was not rigorous. In this paper the inadequate point is corrected, with no essential changes in the final results. For this excitation process to work, disks must be general relativistic. That is, the non-monotonic radial distribution of epicyclic frequency in relativistic disks is essential for the presence of the resonance and for trapping of oscillations. In this paper, the growth rate of resonant oscillations is expressed in a form more suitable for numerical calculations. 
0808.01219	Teichmüller's problem in space	Complex Variables (math.CV)	Authors:R. Klén, V. Todorčević, M. Vuorinen	Abstract:  Quasiconformal homeomorphisms of the whole space Rn, onto itself normalized at one or two points are studied. In particular, the stability theory, the case when the maximal dilatation tends to 1, is in the focus. Our main result provides a spatial analogue of a classical result due to Teichmüller. Unlike Teichmüller's result, our bounds are explicit. Explicit bounds are based on two sharp well-known distortion results: the quasiconformal Schwarz lemma and the bound for linear dilatation. Moreover, Bernoulli type inequalities and asymptotically sharp bounds for special functions involving complete elliptic integrals are applied to simplify the computations. Finally, we discuss the behavior of the quasihyperbolic metric under quasiconformal maps and prove a sharp result for quasiconformal maps of R^n \ {0} onto itself. 
0808.01220	Heavy hadron spectroscopy and the bag model	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Andrius Bernotas, Vytautas Šimonis	Abstract:  Some time ago a slightly improved variant of bag model (the modified bag model) suitable for the unified description of light and heavy hadrons was developed. The main goal of the present work was to calculate the masses of the ground state baryons containing bottom quarks in the framework of this model. For completeness the predictions for other heavy hadrons are also given. The reasonable agreement of our results with other theoretical calculations and available experimental data suggests that our predictions could serve as a useful complementary tool for the interpretation of heavy hadron spectra. 
0808.01221	Neutral Current induced $π^0$ production and neutrino magnetic moment	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:M. Sajjad Athar, S. Chauhan, S. K. Singh	Abstract:  We have studied the total cross section, $Q^2$, momentum and angular distributions for pions in the $ν$($\bar ν$) induced $π^0$ production from nucleons. The calculations have been done for the weak production induced by the neutral current in the standard model and the electromagnetic production induced by neutrino magnetic moment. It has been found that with the present experimental limits on the muon neutrino magnetic moment $μ_{ν_μ}$, the electromagnetic contribution to the cross section for the $π^0$ production is small. The neutrino induced neutral current production of $π^{0}$, while giving an alternative method to study the magnetic moment of neutrino $μ_{ν_μ}$, does not provide any improvement over the present experimental limit on $μ_{ν_μ}$ from the observation of this process in future experiments at T2K and NO$ν$A.

Emtsev, Aaron Bostwick, Karsten Horn, Johannes Jobst, Gary L. Kellogg, Lothar Ley, Jessica L. McChesney, Taisuke Ohta, Sergey A. Reshanov, Eli Rotenberg, Andreas K. Schmid, Daniel Waldmann, Heiko B. Weber, Thomas Seyller	Abstract:  We have investigated epitaxial graphene films grown on SiC(0001) by annealing in an atmosphere of Ar instead of vacuum. Using AFM and LEEM we observe a significantly improved surface morphology and graphene domain size. Hall measurements on monolayer graphene films show a carrier mobility of around 1000 cm^2/Vs at room temperature and 2000 cm^2/Vs at 27K. The growth process introduced here establishes the synthesis of graphene films on a technologically viable basis. 
0808.01223	Constraints and gauge transformations: Dirac's theorem is not always valid	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Julian Barbour, Brendan Z. Foster	Abstract:  A standard tenet of canonical quantum gravity is that evolution generated by a Hamiltonian constraint is just a gauge transformation on the phase space and therefore does not change the physical state. The basis for this belief is a theorem of Dirac that identifies primary first-class constraints as generators of physically irrelevant motions. We point out that certain assumptions on which Dirac based his argument do not hold for reparametrization invariant systems, and show that the primary Hamiltonian constraint of these systems does generate physical motion. We show explicitly how the argument fails for systems described by Jacobi's principle, which has a structure closely resembling that of general relativity. We defer discussion of general relativity and the implications for quantum gravity to a later paper.

0808.01225	Optics-less smart sensors and a possible mechanism of cutaneous vision in nature	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Leonid Yaroslavsky, Chad Goerzen, Stanislav Umansky, H. John Caulfield	Abstract:  Optics-less cutaneous (skin) vision is not rare among living organisms, though its mechanisms and capabilities have not been thoroughly investigated. This paper demonstrates, using methods from statistical parameter estimation theory and numerical simulations, that an array of bare sensors with a natural cosine-law angular sensitivity arranged on a flat or curved surface has the ability to perform imaging tasks without any optics at all. The working principle of this type of optics-less sensor and the model developed here for determining sensor performance may be used to shed light upon possible mechanisms and capabilities of cutaneous vision in nature. 
0808.01226	On the incidence-prevalence relation and length-biased sampling	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:Vittorio Addona, Masoud Asgharian, David B. Wolfson	Abstract:  For many diseases, logistic and other constraints often render large incidence studies difficult, if not impossible, to carry out. This becomes a drawback, particularly when a new incidence study is needed each time the disease incidence rate is investigated in a different population. However, by carrying out a prevalent cohort study with follow-up it is possible to estimate the incidence rate if it is constant. In this paper we derive the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the overall incidence rate, $λ$, as well as age-specific incidence rates, by exploiting the well known epidemiologic relationship, prevalence = incidence $\times$ mean duration ($P = λ \times μ$). We establish the asymptotic distributions of the MLEs, provide approximate confidence intervals for the parameters, and point out that the MLE of $λ$ is asymptotically most efficient. Moreover, the MLE of $λ$ is the natural estimator obtained by substituting the marginal maximum likelihood estimators for P and $μ$, respectively, in the expression $P = λ\times μ$. Our work is related to that of Keiding (1991, 2006), who, using a Markov process model, proposed estimators for the incidence rate from a prevalent cohort study \emph{without} follow-up, under three different scenarios. However, each scenario requires assumptions that are both disease specific and depend on the availability of epidemiologic data at the population level. With follow-up, we are able to remove these restrictions, and our results apply in a wide range of circumstances. We apply our methods to data collected as part of the Canadian Study of Health and Ageing to estimate the incidence rate of dementia amongst elderly Canadians. 
0808.01227	A Semi-Analytic Model for the Co-evolution of Galaxies, Black Holes, and Active Galactic Nuclei	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Rachel S. Somerville, Philip F. Hopkins, Thomas J. Cox, Brant E. Robertson, Lars Hernquist	Abstract:  We present a new semi-analytic model that self-consistently traces the growth of supermassive black holes (BH) and their host galaxies within the context of the LCDM cosmological framework. In our model, the energy emitted by accreting black holes regulates the growth of the black holes themselves, drives galactic scale winds that can remove cold gas from galaxies, and produces powerful jets that heat the hot gas atmospheres surrounding groups and clusters. We present a comprehensive comparison of our model predictions with observational measurements of key physical properties of low-redshift galaxies, such as cold gas fractions, stellar metallicities and ages, and specific star formation rates. We find that our new models successfully reproduce the exponential cutoff in the stellar mass function and the stellar and cold gas mass densities at z~0, and predict that star formation should be largely, but not entirely, quenched in massive galaxies at the present day. We also find that our model of self-regulated BH growth naturally reproduces the observed relation between BH mass and bulge mass. We explore the global formation history of galaxies in our models, presenting predictions for the cosmic histories of star formation, stellar mass assembly, cold gas, and metals. We find that models assuming the "concordance" LCDM cosmology overproduce star formation and stellar mass at high redshift (z>2). A model with less small-scale power predicts less star formation at high redshift, and excellent agreement with the observed stellar mass assembly history, but may have difficulty accounting for the cold gas in quasar absorption systems at high redshift (z~3-4). 
0808.01228	Similar Sublattices and Coincidence Rotations of the Root Lattice A4 and its Dual	Metric Geometry (math.MG)	Authors:Manuela Heuer	Abstract:  A natural way to describe the Penrose tiling employs the projection method on the basis of the root lattice A4 or its dual. Properties of these lattices are thus related to properties of the Penrose tiling. Moreover, the root lattice A4 appears in various other contexts such as sphere packings, efficient coding schemes and lattice quantizers. Here, the lattice A4 is considered within the icosian ring, whose rich arithmetic structure leads to parametrisations of the similar sublattices and the coincidence rotations of A4 and its dual lattice. These parametrisations, both in terms of a single icosian, imply an index formula for the corresponding sublattices. The results are encapsulated in Dirichlet series generating functions. For every index, they provide the number of distinct similar sublattices as well as the number of coincidence rotations of A4 and its dual. 
0808.01229	Simulation of Growth of Graded Bandgap Solid Solutions of GaAsxP1-x at Liquid Phase Electroepitaxy	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:V.V. Tsybulenko, Ye.A. Baganov, V.A. Krasnov, S.V. Shutov	Abstract:  The possibility of the composition control of the GaAs1-xPx solid solution on the GaAs substrate at liquid phase electroepitaxy from the Ga-As-P solution-melt is theoretically considered. By the simulation it was determined, that under steady-state conditions specifying such parameters of the process as the temperature and/or the thickness of the growth space it is possible to obtain graded bandgap layers of the GaAs1-xPx solid solution with increasing of the content of P towards the surface of the layer that possess the composition gradient from 0.5x10-4 mole fraction/nm to 2.0x10-3 mole fraction/nm. It was also shown that control of the composition of ternary solid solutions at liquid phase electroepitaxy can be realized by use of unsteady state electric field. 
0808.01230	Range Corrections to Three-Body Observables near a Feshbach Resonance	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Lucas Platter, Chen Ji, Daniel R. Phillips	Abstract:  A non-relativistic system of three identical particles will display a rich set of universal features known as Efimov physics if the scattering length a is much larger than the range l of the underlying two-body interaction. An appropriate effective theory facilitates the derivation of both results in the |a| goes to infinity limit and finite-l/a corrections to observables of interest. Here we use such an effective-theory treatment to consider the impact of corrections linear in the two-body effective range, r_s on the three-boson bound-state spectrum and recombination rate for |a| much greater than |r_s|. We do this by first deriving results appropriate to the strict limit |a| goes to infinity in coordinate space. We then extend these results to finite a using once-subtracted momentum-space integral equations. We also discuss the implications of our results for experiments that probe three-body recombination in Bose-Einstein condensates near a Feshbach resonance.

Latorre, Andrea Piccione, Juan Rojo, Maria Ubiali	Abstract:  We present the determination of a set of parton distributions of the nucleon, at next-to-leading order, from a global set of deep-inelastic scattering data: NNPDF1.0. The determination is based on a Monte Carlo approach, with neural networks used as unbiased interpolants. This method, previously discussed by us and applied to a determination of the nonsinglet quark distribution, is designed to provide a faithful and statistically sound representation of the uncertainty on parton distributions. We discuss our dataset, its statistical features, and its Monte Carlo representation. We summarize the technique used to solve the evolution equations and its benchmarking, and the method used to compute physical observables. We discuss the parametrization and fitting of neural networks, and the algorithm used to determine the optimal fit. We finally present our set of parton distributions. We discuss its statistical properties, test for its stability upon various modifications of the fitting procedure, and compare it to other recent parton sets. We use it to compute the benchmark W and Z cross sections at the LHC. We discuss issues of delivery and interfacing to commonly used packages such as LHAPDF.

0808.01233	Mechanism of thermal renaturation and hybridization of nucleic acids: Kramers process and universality in Watson-Crick base pairing	Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)	Authors:Jean-Louis Sikorav, Henri Orland, Alan Braslau	Abstract:  Renaturation and hybridization reactions lead to the pairing of complementary single-stranded nucleic acids. We present here a theoretical investigation of the mechanism of these reactions in vitro under thermal conditions (dilute solutions of single-stranded chains, in the presence of molar concentrations of monovalent salts and at elevated temperatures). The mechanism follows a Kramers' process, whereby the complementary chains overcome a potential barrier through Brownian motion. The barrier originates from a single rate-limiting nucleation event in which the first complementary base pairs are formed. The reaction then proceeds through a fast growth of the double helix. For the DNA of bacteriophages T7, T4 and $φ$X174 as well as for Escherichia coli DNA, the bimolecular rate $k_2$ of the reaction increases as a power law of the average degree of polymerization $<N>$ of the reacting single- strands: $k_2 \prop <N>^α$. This relationship holds for $100 \leq <N> \leq 50 000$ with an experimentally determined exponent $α= 0.51 \pm 0.01$. The length dependence results from a thermodynamic excluded-volume effect. The reacting single-stranded chains are predicted to be in universal good solvent conditions, and the scaling law is determined by the relevant equilibrium monomer contact probability. The value theoretically predicted for the exponent is $α= 1-νθ_2$, where $ν$ is Flory's swelling exponent ($nu approx 0.588$) and $θ_2$ is a critical exponent introduced by des Cloizeaux ($θ_2 \approx 0.82$), yielding $α= 0.52 \pm 0.01$, in agreement with the experimental results. 
0808.01234	Valley splitting in Si quantum dots embedded in SiGe	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:S. Srinivasan, G. Klimeck, L. P. Rokhinson	Abstract:  We examine energy spectra of Si quantum dots embedded into Si_{0.75}Ge_{0.25} buffers using atomistic numerical calculations for dimensions relevant to qubit implementations. The valley degeneracy of the lowest orbital state is lifted and valley splitting fluctuates with monolayer frequency as a function of the dot thickness. For dot thicknesses <6 nm valley splitting is found to be >150 ueV. Using the unique advantage of atomistic calculations we analyze the effect of buffer disorder on valley splitting. Disorder in the buffer leads to the suppression of valley splitting by a factor of 2.5, the splitting fluctuates with ~20 ueV for different disorder realizations. Through these simulations we can guide future experiments into regions of low device-to-device fluctuations. 
0808.01235	Hodographic Vortices	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Antonio Moro	Abstract:  Vortices are screw phase dislocations associated with helicoidal wave-fronts. In nonlinear optics, vortices arise as singular solutions to the phase-intensity equations of geometric optics. They exist for a general class of nonlinear response functions. In this sense, vortices possess a universal character. Analysis of geometric optics equations on the hodograph plane leads to deformed vortex type solutions that are sensitive to the form of the nonlinearity. The case of a Kerr type nonlinear response is discussed as a specific example. 
0808.01236	The beginning of cosmic ray astronomy	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Todor Stanev (Bartol Research Institute and Department of Physics and astronomy, University of Delaware)    	Abstract:  We discuss the anisotropic arrival directions of the ultra high energy cosmic rays detected by Auger which I consider one of the biggest discoverie in astrophysics during the last year. 
0808.01237	Energy dependence of particle ratio fluctuations in central Pb+Pb collisions from $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} =$~6.3 to 17.3 GeV	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:NA49 Collaboration	Abstract:  We present measurements of the energy dependence of event-by-event fluctuations in the K/pi and (p + \bar{p})/pi multiplicity ratios in heavy ion collisions at the CERN SPS. The particle ratio fluctuations were obtained for central Pb+Pb collisions at five collision energies, \sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}, between 6.3 and 17.3 GeV. After accounting for the effects of finite-number statistics and detector resolution, we extract the strength of non-statistical fluctuations at each energy. For the K/pi ratio, larger fluctuations than expected for independent particle production are found at all collision energies. The fluctuations in the (p + \bar{p})/pi ratio are smaller than expectations from independent particle production, indicating correlated pion and proton production from resonance decays. For both ratios, the deviation from purely statistical fluctuations shows an increase towards lower collision energies. The results are compared to transport model calculations, which fail to describe the energy dependence of the K/pi ratio fluctuations. 
0808.01238	Dynamics Groups of Asynchronous Cellular Automata	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Matthew Macauley, Jon McCammond, Henning S. Mortveit	Abstract:  We say that a finite asynchronous cellular automaton (or more generally, any sequential dynamical system) is pi-independent if its set of periodic points are independent of the order that the local functions are applied. In this case, the local functions permute the periodic points, and these permutations generate the dynamics group. We have previously shown that exactly 104 of the possible 256 cellular automaton rules are pi-independent. In this article, we classify the periodic states of these systems and describe their dynamics groups, which are quotients of Coxeter groups. The dynamics groups provide information about permissible dynamics as a function of update sequence and, as such, connect discrete dynamical systems, group theory, and algebraic combinatorics in a new and interesting way. We conclude with a discussion of numerous open problems and directions for future research. 
0808.01239	Homology and finiteness properties of SL_2(Z[t,t^{-1}])	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Kevin P. Knudson	Abstract:  We show that the group $H_2(\slzti;\zz)$ is not finitely generated, answering a question mentioned by Bux and Wortman in \cite{bux}. 
0808.01240	Transmission spectra of Fe/MgO (001) double-barrier tunnel junctions at finite bias	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:J. Peralta-Ramos, A. M. Llois	Abstract:  In this contribution, we calculate in a self-consistent way the ballistic transmission as a function of energy of one Fe/MgO (001) single-barrier and one double-barrier tunnel junction, relating them to their electronic structure. The transmission spectra of each kind of junction is calculated at different applied bias voltages. We focus on the impact that bias has on the resonant tunneling mediated by surface and quantum well states. The calculations are done in the coherent regime, using a combination of density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's functions, as implemented in the {\it ab initio} code {\it SMEAGOL}. We conclude that, for both kinds of junction, the transmission functions depend on the applied bias voltage. In the single-barrier junction, transport mediated by resonant Fe minority surface states is rapidly destroyed by bias. In the double-barrier junction, the appearance of resonant tunneling through majority quantum well states is strongly affected by bias. 
0808.01241	Non-Hermitian spectra and Anderson localization	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Luca Guido Molinari	Abstract:  The spectrum of exponents of the transfer matrix provides the localization lengths of Anderson's model for a particle in a lattice with disordered potential. I show that a duality identity for determinants and Jensen's identity for subharmonic functions, give a formula for the spectrum in terms of eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian with non-Hermitian boundary conditions. The formula is exact; it involves an average over a Bloch phase, rather than disorder. A preliminary investigation of non-Hermitian spectra of Anderson's model in D=1,2 and on the smallest exponent is presented. 
0808.01242	Contact interactions in low scale string models with intersecting $D6$-branes	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Marc Chemtob	Abstract:  We evaluate the tree level four fermion string amplitudes in the TeV string mass scale models with intersecting $D6$-branes. The coefficient functions of contact interactions subsuming the contributions of string Regge resonance and winding mode excitations are obtained by subtracting out the contributions from the string massless and massive momentum modes. Numerical applications are developed for the Standard Model like solution of Cremades, Ibanez, and Marchesano for a toroidal orientifold with four intersecting $D6$-brane stacks. The chirality conserving contact interactions of the quarks and leptons are considered in applications to high energy collider and flavor changing neutral current phenomenology. The two main free parameters consist of the string and compactification mass scales, $ m_s$ and $ M_c$. Useful constraints on these parameters are derived from predictions for the Bhabha scattering differential cross section and for the observables associated to the mass shifts of the neutral meson systems $ K-\bar K, B-\bar B, D-\bar D$ and the lepton number violating three-body leptonic decays of the charged leptons $μ$ and $ τ $. 
0808.01243	Pion in the Holographic Model with 5D Yang-Mills Fields	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Hovhannes R. Grigoryan, Anatoly V. Radyushkin	Abstract:  We study pion in the holographic model of Hirn and Sanz which contains two Yang-Mills fields defined in the background of the sliced AdS space. The infrared boundary conditions imposed on these fields generate the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry down to its vector subgroup. Within the framework of this model, we get an analytic expression for the pion form factor and a compact result for its radius. We also extend the holographic model to include Chern-Simons term which is required to reproduce the appropriate axial anomaly of QCD. As a result, we calculate the anomalous form factor of the pion and predict its Q^2-slope for the kinematics when one of the photons is almost on-shell. We also observe that the anomalous form factor with one real and one virtual photon is given by the same analytic expression as the electromagnetic form factor of a charged pion. One of the advantages of the present model is that it does not require an infrared boundary counterterm to correctly reproduce the anomaly of QCD. 
0808.01244	Tilings, Chern-Simons Theories and M2 Branes	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Amihay Hanany, Alberto Zaffaroni	Abstract:  A new infinite class of Chern-Simons theories is presented using brane tilings. The new class reproduces all known cases so far and introduces many new models that are dual to M2 brane theories which probe a toric non-compact CY 4-fold. The master space of the quiver theory is used as a tool to construct the moduli space for this class and the Hilbert Series is computed for a selected set of examples. 
0808.01245	Bohmian trajectories and the Path Integral Paradigm. Complexified Lagrangian Mechanics	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Valeriy I. Sbitnev	Abstract:  David Bohm shown that the Schr{ö}dinger equation, that is a "visiting card" of quantum mechanics, can be decomposed onto two equations for real functions - action and probability density. The first equation is the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation, a "visiting card" of classical mechanics, to be modified by the Bohmian quantum potential. And the second is the continuity equation. The latter can be transformed to the entropy balance equation. The Bohmian quantum potential is transformed to two Bohmian quantum correctors. The first corrector modifies kinetic energy term of the HJ equation, and the second one modifies potential energy term. Unification of the quantum HJ equation and the entropy balance equation gives complexified HJ equation containing complex kinetic and potential terms. Imaginary parts of these terms have order of smallness about the Planck constant. The Bohmian quantum corrector is indispensable term modifying the Feynman's path integral by expanding coordinates and momenta to imaginary sector. 
0808.01246	Minimum Dissatisfaction Personnel Scheduling	Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)	Authors:Mugurel Ionut Andreica, Romulus Andreica, Angela Andreica	Abstract:  In this paper we consider two problems regarding the scheduling of available personnel in order to perform a given quantity of work, which can be arbitrarily decomposed into a sequence of activities. We are interested in schedules which minimize the overall dissatisfaction, where each employee's dissatisfaction is modeled as a time-dependent linear function. For the two situations considered we provide a detailed mathematical analysis, as well as efficient algorithms for determining optimal schedules. 
0808.01247	Self-Motions of General 3-RPR Planar Parallel Robots	Robotics (cs.RO)	Authors:Sébastien Briot (DGMA), Ilian Bonev (GPA), Damien Chablat (IRCCyN), Philippe Wenger (IRCCyN), Vigen Arakelian (DGMA)    	Abstract:  This paper studies the kinematic geometry of general 3-RPR planar parallel robots with actuated base joints. These robots, while largely overlooked, have simple direct kinematics and large singularity-free workspace. Furthermore, their kinematic geometry is the same as that of a newly developed parallel robot with SCARA-type motions. Starting from the direct and inverse kinematic model, the expressions for the singularity loci of 3-RPR planar parallel robots are determined. Then, the global behaviour at all singularities is geometrically described by studying the degeneracy of the direct kinematic model. Special cases of self-motions are then examined and the degree of freedom gained in such special configurations is kinematically interpreted. Finally, a practical example is discussed and experimental validations performed on an actual robot prototype are presented. 
0808.01248	A dialectical view of the variational principles of mechanics	History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)	Authors:Qiuping A. Wang (ISMANS)    	Abstract:  The aim of this work is to provide a possible philosophical motivation to the variational principles of physics in general and a possible way to unify the axiomatizations of mechanics theories. The leitmotif of this work is a dialectical view of the world: any smooth motion in nature is the consequence of the interplay and dynamical balance between pairs of opposite elements of the motion. We stress that the opposite property here differs from the common sense of opposing elements (of conflicting appearance but of same nature) such action/reaction forces between two bodies. The opposite elements here are incompatible and mutual exclusive in nature, with contrasting and complementary characteristics such as active/passive, disorder/order, curvature/flatness, etc. The dynamical balance is defined by an invariant variational relationship between all the pairs of opposite elements active in the considered motion. From this idea, an axiomatization of quantum mechanics is proposed in addition to the derivation of several existing variational principles of mechanics. 
0808.01249	Modeling Carbon Chain Anions in L1527	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Nanase Harada, Eric Herbst	Abstract:  The low-mass protostellar region L1527 is unusual because it contains observable abundances of unsaturated carbon-chain molecules including CnH radicals, H2Cn carbenes, cyanopolyynes, and the negative ions C4H- and C6H-, all of which are more associated with cold cores than with protostellar regions. Sakai et al. suggested that these molecules are formed in L1527 from the chemical precursor methane, which evaporates from the grains during the heat-up of the region. With the gas-phase osu.03.2008 network extended to include negative ions of the families Cn-, and CnH-, as well as the newly detected C3N-, we modeled the chemistry that occurs following methane evaporation at T~ 25-30 K. We are able to reproduce most of the observed molecular abundances in L1527 at a time of ~5000 yr. At later times, the overall abundance of anions become greater than that of electrons, which has an impact on many organic species and ions. The anion-to-neutral ratio in our calculation is in good agreement with observation for C6H- but exceeds the observed ratio by more than three orders of magnitude for C4H-. In order to explain this difference, further investigation is needed on the rate coefficients for electron attachment and other reactions regarding anions. 
0808.01250	Recursion Relations from Space-time Supersymmetry	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Anirban Basu, Savdeep Sethi	Abstract:  We describe a method for obtaining relations between higher derivative interactions in supersymmetric effective actions. The method extends to all orders in the momentum expansion. As an application, we consider the string coupling dependence of the \hat{G}^{2k} λ^{16} interaction in type IIB string theory. Using supersymmetry, we show that each of these interactions satisfies a Poisson equation on the moduli space with sources determined by lower momentum interactions. We argue that these protected couplings are only renormalized by a finite number of string loops together with non-perturbative terms. Finally, we explore some consequences of the Poisson equation for low values of k. 
0808.01251	Coverings of Laura Algebras: the Standard Case	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Ibrahim Assem, Juan Carlos Bustamante, Patrick Le Meur (CMLA)    	Abstract:  In this paper, we study the covering theory of laura algebras. We prove that if a connected laura algebra is standard (that is, it is not quasi-tilted of canonical type and its connecting components are standard), then this algebra has nice Galois coverings associated to the coverings of the connecting component. As a consequence, we show that the first Hochschild cohomology group of a standard laura algebra vanishes if and only if it has no proper Galois coverings. 
0808.01252	Theoretical study of elastic electron scattering off stable and exotic nuclei	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:X. Roca-Maza, M. Centelles, F. Salvat, X. Vinas	Abstract:  Results for elastic electron scattering by nuclei, calculated with charge densities of Skyrme forces and covariant effective Lagrangians that accurately describe nuclear ground states, are compared against experiment in stable isotopes. Dirac partial-wave calculations are performed with an adapted version of the ELSEPA package. Motivated by the fact that studies of electron scattering off exotic nuclei are intended in future facilities in the commissioned GSI and RIKEN upgrades, we survey the theoretical predictions from neutron-deficient to neutron-rich isotopes in the tin and calcium isotopic chains. The charge densities of a covariant interaction that describes the low-energy electromagnetic structure of the nucleon within the Lagrangian of the theory are used to this end. The study is restricted to medium and heavy mass nuclei because the charge densities are computed in mean field approach. Since the experimental analysis of scattering data commonly involves parameterized charge densities, as a surrogate exercise for the yet unexplored exotic nuclei, we fit our calculated mean field densities with Helm model distributions. This procedure turns out to be helpful to study the neutron-number variation of the scattering observables and allows us to identify correlations of potential interest among some of these observables within the isotopic chains. 
0808.01253	Invariant quantities in shear flow	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:A. Baule, R. M. L. Evans	Abstract:  The dynamics of systems out of thermal equilibrium is usually treated on a case-by-case basis without knowledge of fundamental and universal principles. We address this problem for a class of driven steady states, namely those mechanically driven at the boundaries such as complex fluids under shear. From a nonequilibrium counterpart to detailed balance (NCDB) we derive a remarkably simple set of invariant quantities which remain unchanged when the system is driven. These new nonequilibrium relations are both exact and valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium. Furthermore, they enable the systematic calculation of transition rates in driven systems with state-spaces of arbitrary connectivity. 
0808.01254	The Co-evolution of Galaxies, Black Holes, and AGN in a Hierarchical Universe	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Rachel S. Somerville	Abstract:  The observational link between Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH) and galaxies at low redshift seems to be very tight, and statistically the global evolution of star formation activity and BH accretion activity also seem to trace each other closely. However, pinning down the co-evolution of galaxies and BH on an object-by-object basis remains elusive. I present results from new models for the joint evolution of galaxies, SMBH, and AGN, which may be able to help resolve some of the observational puzzles. A unique aspect of these models is our treatment of self-regulated BH growth based on hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy-galaxy mergers. Although these models do quite well at reproducing the observed evolution of galaxies, they do not reproduce the observed history of BH accretion, predicting too much early accretion and not enough at late times. I suggest two possible resolutions to this problem. 
0808.01255	Built-in surface field effect on the 180-degree domain wall structure in ferroics	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Eugene A. Eliseev	Abstract:  We consider the influence of the built-in surface field on the 180-degree domain wall profile in primary ferroics within Landau-Ginsburg-Devonshire phenomenological approach. We predict the effect of domain wall bending near the surface caused by the built-in field and derived corresponding approximate analytical expressions. At that the higher is the surface energy contribution (i.e. the smaller is corresponding extrapolation length) and/or the higher is the field, the stronger is the bending effect. Built-in surface field is one of the possible mechanisms of domain wall near surface broadening recently observed in the ferroics. 
0808.01256	Bulk asymptotics of skew-orthogonal polynomials for quartic double well potential and universality in the matrix model	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Saugata Ghosh	Abstract:  We derive bulk asymptotics of skew-orthogonal polynomials (sop) $π^{\bt}_{m}$, $β=1$, 4, defined w.r.t. the weight $\exp(-2NV(x))$, $V (x)=gx^4/4+tx^2/2$, $g>0$ and $t<0$. We assume that as $m,N \to\infty$ there exists an $ε> 0$, such that $ε\leq (m/N)\leq λ_{\rm cr}-ε$, where $λ_{\rm cr}$ is the critical value which separates sop with two cuts from those with one cut. Simultaneously we derive asymptotics for the recursive coefficients of skew-orthogonal polynomials. The proof is based on obtaining a finite term recursion relation between sop and orthogonal polynomials (op) and using asymptotic results of op derived in \cite{bleher}. Finally, we apply these asymptotic results of sop and their recursion coefficients in the generalized Christoffel-Darboux formula (GCD) \cite{ghosh3} to obtain level densities and sine-kernels in the bulk of the spectrum for orthogonal and symplectic ensembles of random matrices. 
0808.01257	Charge Imbalance and Bilayer 2D Electron Systems at $ν_T = 1$	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:A.R. Champagne, A.D.K. Finck, J.P. Eisenstein, L.N. Pfeiffer, K.W. West	Abstract:  We use interlayer tunneling to study bilayer 2D electron systems at $ν_T = 1$ over a wide range of charge density imbalance, $Δν=ν_1-ν_2$, between the two layers. We find that the strongly enhanced tunneling associated with the coherent excitonic $ν_T = 1$ phase at small layer separation can survive at least up to an imbalance of $Δν$ = 0.5, i.e $(ν_1, ν_2)$ = (3/4, 1/4). Phase transitions between the excitonic $ν_T = 1$ state and bilayer states which lack significant interlayer correlations can be induced in three different ways: by increasing the effective interlayer spacing $d/\ell$, the temperature $T$, or the charge imbalance, $Δν$. We observe that close to the phase boundary the coherent $ν_T = 1$ phase can be absent at $Δν$ = 0, present at intermediate $Δν$, but then absent again at large $Δν$, thus indicating an intricate phase competition between it and incoherent quasi-independent layer states. At zero imbalance, the critical $d/\ell$ shifts linearly with temperature, while at $Δν$ = 1/3 the critical $d/\ell$ is only weakly dependent on $T$. At $Δν$ = 1/3 we report the first observation of a direct phase transition between the coherent excitonic $ν_T = 1$ bilayer integer quantum Hall phase and the pair of single layer fractional quantized Hall states at $ν_1$ = 2/3 and $ν_2=1/3$. 
0808.01258	Simulating radiation and kinetic processes in relativistic plasmas	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:R. Belmont, J. Malzac, A. Marcowith	Abstract:  Modelling the emission properties of compact high energy sources such as X-ray binaries, AGN or gamma-ray bursts represents a complex problem. Contributions of numerous processes participate non linearly to produce the observed spectra: particle-particle, particle-photon and particle-wave interactions. In the past decades, numerical simulations have been widely used to address the key properties of the high energy plasmas present in these sources. This article presents a code that has been designed to investigate these questions. It includes most of the relevant processes needed to simulate the emission of high energy sources. This code solves the time-dependent kinetic equations for homogeneous, isotropic distributions of photons, electrons and positrons. No assumption is made on the shape of these distributions. Have been included so far: syn- chrotron self-absorbed radiation, Compton scattering, pair production/annihilation, e-e and e-p Coulomb collisions and some prescriptions for additional particle heating and acceleration. We also present comparisons with earlier works and some examples to illustrate the code computational capacities. Previous results are reproduced qualitatively but some differences are often found in the details of the particle As a first application of the code, we investigate acceleration by second order Fermi-like processes and we find that the energy threshold for acceleration has a crucial influence on the particle distribution and the emitted spectrum. 
0808.01259	Optics-less Sensors for Localization of Radiation Sources	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:H.J. Caulfield, L. P. Yaroslavsky, Ch. Goerzen, S. Umansky	Abstract:  A new family of radiation sensors is introduced which do not require any optics. The sensors consist of arrays of elementary sub-sensors with natural cosine-law or similar angular sensitivity supplemented with a signal processing unit that computes optimal statistical estimations of source parameters. We show, both theoretically and by computer simulation, that such sensors are capable of accurate localization and intensity estimation of a given number of radiation sources and of imaging of a given number of sources in known positions. The accuracy is found to be dependent only on the sub-sensors noise level, on the number of sub-sensors and on the spacing between radiation sources. 
0808.01260	From Inference to Physics	Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)	Authors:Ariel Caticha	Abstract:  Entropic dynamics, a program that aims at deriving the laws of physics from standard probabilistic and entropic rules for processing information, is developed further. We calculate the probability for an arbitrary path followed by a system as it moves from given initial to final states. For an appropriately chosen configuration space the path of maximum probability reproduces Newtonian dynamics. 
0808.01261	Spacetime Foam and Dark Energy	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Y. Jack Ng	Abstract:  Due to quantum fluctuations, spacetime is foamy on small scales. The degree of foaminess is found to be consistent with the holographic principle. One way to detect spacetime foam is to look for halos in the images of distant quasars. Applying the holographic foam model to cosmology we "predict" that the cosmic energy density takes on the critical value; and basing only on existing archived data on active galactic nuclei from the Hubble Space Telescope, we also "predict" the existence of dark energy which, we argue, is composed of an enormous number of inert "particles" of extremely long wavelength. We speculate that these "particles" obey infinite statistics. 
0808.01262	Trans-Planckian Physics from a Nonlinear Dispersion Relation	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:S. E. Joras, G. Marozzi	Abstract:  We study a particular nonlinear dispersion relation $ω_p(k_p)$ -- a series expansion in the physical wavenumber $k_p$ -- for modeling first-order corrections in the equation of motion of a test scalar field in a de Sitter spacetime from trans-Planckian physics in cosmology. Using both a numerical approach and a semianalytical one, we show that the WKB approximation previously adopted in the literature should be used with caution, since it holds only when the comoving wavenumber $k\gg aH$. We determine the amplitude and behavior of the corrections on the power spectrum for this test field. Furthermore, we consider also a more realistic model of inflation, the power-law model, using only a numerical approach to determine the corrections on the power spectrum. 
0808.01263	Impurity effects on the melting of Ni clusters	Atomic and Molecular Clusters (physics.atm-clus)	Authors:Andrey Lyalin, Adilah Hussien, Andrey V. Solov'yov, Walter Greiner	Abstract:  We demonstrate that the addition of a single carbon impurity leads to significant changes in the thermodynamic properties of Ni clusters consisting of more than a hundred atoms. The magnitude of the change induced is dependent upon the parameters of the Ni-C interaction. Hence, thermodynamic properties of Ni clusters can be effectively tuned by the addition of an impurity of a particular type. We also show that the presence of a carbon impurity considerably changes the mobility and diffusion of atoms in the Ni cluster at temperatures close to its melting point. The calculated diffusion coefficients of the carbon impurity in the Ni cluster can be used for a reliable estimate of the growth rate of carbon nanotubes. 
0808.01264	A Toy Model for Gauge-Mediation in Intersecting Brane Models	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Jason Kumar	Abstract:  We discuss the phenomenology of a toy intersecting brane model where supersymmetry is dynamically broken in an open string hidden sector and gauge-mediated to the visible sector. Scalar masses ~ TeV are easily realizable, and R-symmetry is broken. These ideas are easily generalizable to other intersecting brane models. 
0808.01265	Quantum bit error rate in modeled atmospheres	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Nicolo' Antonietti, Marina Mondin, Fred Daneshgaran, Giorgio Giovanelli, Ivan Kostadinov, Bruno Lunelli, Giorgio Brida, Marco Genovese, Marco Gramegna	Abstract:  The quantum bit error rate is a key quantity in quantum communications. If the quantum channel is the atmosphere, the information is usually encoded in the polarization of a photon. A link budget is required, which takes into account the depolarization of the photon after its interaction with the atmosphere as well as absorption, scattering and atmospheric emissions. An experimental setup for the reproduction of a simple model of the atmosphere is used to evaluate the quantum bit error rate in a BB84 protocol and the results are presented. This result represents a first step toward the realization of an optical bench experiment where atmospheric effects are simulated and controlled for reproducing the effects on a quantum channel in different meteorological situations. 
0808.01266	A search for the standard model Higgs boson in the missing energy and acoplanar b-jet topology at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:D0 Collaboration: V. Abazov, et al    	Abstract:  We report a search for the standard model Higgs boson in the missing energy and acoplanar b-jet topology, using an integrated luminosity of 0.93 inverse femtobarn recorded by the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The analysis includes signal contributions from pp->ZH->nu nu b b, as well as from WH production in which the charged lepton from the W boson decay is undetected. Neural networks are used to separate signal from background. In the absence of a signal, we set limits on the cross section of pp->VH times the branching ratio of H->bb at the 95% C.L. of 2.6 - 2.3 pb, for Higgs boson masses in the range 105 - 135 GeV, where V=W,Z. The corresponding expected limits range from 2.8 pb - 2.0 pb. 
0808.01267	On the Casimir energy for a massive quantum scalar field and the Cosmological constant	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:G. Gazzola, M. C. Nemes, W. F. Wreszinski	Abstract:  We present a rigorous, regularization independent local quantum field theoretic treatment of the Casimir effect for a quantum scalar field of mass $μ\ne0$ which yields closed form expressions for the energy density and pressure. As an application we show that there exist special states of the quantum field at fixed cosmic time, in which the expectation value of the renormalized energy-momentum tensor is independent of the space coordinate and is of the perfect fluid form $g_{μ,ν}ρ_{vac}$ with $ρ_{vac}>0$, thus providing a quantum field theoretic foundation of the Cosmological constant. Using some values of $μ$ suggested in the literature for the hypothetical axion particle, there results a model for dark energy which is consistent with past and future evolution and is also in good agreement with experimental data. 
0808.01268	Interface solitons in two-dimensional photonic lattices	Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)	Authors:Mario I. Molina, Yuri S. Kivshar	Abstract:  We analyze localization of light at the interface separating square and hexagonal photonic lattices, as recently realized experimentally in two-dimensional laser-written waveguide arrays in silica glass with self-focusing nonlinearity [A. Szameit {\em et al.}, Opt. Lett. {\bf 33}, 663 (2008)]. We reveal the conditions for the existence of {\em linear} and {\em nonlinear} surface states substantially influenced by the lattice topology, and study the effect of the different symmetries and couplings on the stability of two-dimensional interface solitons. 
0808.01269	Super-leading logarithms in non-global observables in QCD: Colour basis independent calculation	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:J.R. Forshaw, A. Kyrieleis, M.H. Seymour	Abstract:  In a previous paper we reported the discovery of super-leading logarithmic terms in a non-global QCD observable. In this short update we recalculate the first super-leading logarithmic contribution to the 'gaps between jets' cross-section using a colour basis independent notation. This sheds light on the structure and origin of the super-leading terms and allows them to be calculated for gluon scattering processes for the first time. 
0808.01270	A Hecke Correspondence Theorem for Automorphic Integrals with Symmetric Rational Period Functions on the Hecke Groups	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Wendell Ressler	Abstract:  Marvin Knopp developed the theory of automorphic integrals, which generalize automorphic forms; each automorphic integral has an additional period function in its automorphic relation. The period functions satisfy relations that arise from the underlying group relations. Knopp showed that entire automorphic integrals with rational period functions satisfy a Hecke correspondence theorem, provided the rational period functions have poles only at 0 or infinity. For other automorphic integrals each corresponding Dirichlet series has a functional equation with a remainder term that arises from the nonzero poles of the rational period function. In this paper we prove a Hecke correspondence theorem for a class of automorphic integrals with rational period functions on the Hecke groups. We restrict our attention to automorphic integrals of weight that is twice an odd integer and to rational period functions that satisfy a symmetry property we call "Hecke-symmetry." We explicate the relationship between the structure of the rational period functions and the corresponding remainder terms. Each remainder term satisfies two relations (the second of which is new in this paper) corresponding to the two relations for the rational period function. 
0808.01271	On deformed gauge theories and their string/M-theory duals	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Emiliano Imeroni	Abstract:  We present general formulae for the TsT transformation (T-duality, shift, T-duality) of type II string backgrounds and open string boundary conditions. The TsT transformation provides a systematic procedure to find string theory duals of gauge theories with deformed products of fields in the lagrangian, and the duals can be analyzed by using transformed D-brane probes. As examples illustrating some features of the deformed theories, we consider the known backgrounds dual to non-commutative, dipole and beta-deformed N=4 Super Yang-Mills as well as new backgrounds dual to deformations of the recently proposed N=6 Chern-Simons-matter theory living on multiple M2-branes on an orbifold. 
0808.01272	Spontaneous recoil effects of optical pumping on trapped atoms	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:S. Wallentowitz, P.E. Toschek	Abstract:  The recoil effects of spontaneous photon emissions during optical pumping of a trapped three-level atom are exactly calculated. Without resort to the Lamb-Dicke approximation, and considering arbitrary detuning and saturation of the pump laser, the density of recoil shifts in phase space is derived. It is shown that this density is not of Gaussian shape, and that it becomes isotropic in phase space only for a branching ratio corresponding to fluorescence scattering but unfavorable for optical pumping. The dependence of its anisotropy on the laser saturation is discussed in the resonant case, and the mapping of moments of the atom's center-of-mass motion due to the pumping is presented. Moreover, it is shown how optimum parameters for protecting the center-of-mass quantum state from pump-induced disturbance depend on the specific property to be protected. 
0808.01273	Extensions of positive definite functions on amenable groups	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:M. Bakonyi, D. Timotin	Abstract:  Let $S$ be a subset of a amenable group $G$ such that $e\in S$ and $S^{-1}=S$. The main result of the paper states that if the Cayley graph of $G$ with respect to $S$ has a certain combinatorial property, then every positive definite operator-valued function on $S$ can be extended to a positive definite function on $G$. Several known extension results are obtained as a corollary. New applications are also presented. 
0808.01274	Obstructions to the Existence and Squeezing of Lagrangian Cobordisms	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Joshua M. Sabloff, Lisa Traynor	Abstract:  Capacities that provide both qualitative and quantitative obstructions to the existence of a Lagrangian cobordism between two $(n-1)$-dimensional submanifolds in parallel hyperplanes of $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ are defined using the theory of generating families. Qualitatively, these capacities show that, for example, in $\mathbb R^4$ there is no Lagrangian cobordism between two $\infty$-shaped curves with a negative crossing when the lower end is "smaller". Quantitatively, when the boundary of a Lagrangian ball lies in a hyperplane of $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, the capacity of the boundary gives a restriction on the size of a rectangular cylinder into which the Lagrangian ball can be squeezed. 
0808.01275	Matrix Factorizations For Non-Abelian Orbifolds	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Eleonora Dell'Aquila	Abstract:  We discuss a prescription to construct fractional branes in Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds, with particular attention to the case of non-abelian orbifolds. We analyze in detail a S_3 orbifold and a D_n orbifold and show how the computation of the spectrum can be carried out explicitly even when the factorizations involve higher rank matrices. 
0808.01276	Linear systems and determinantal random point fields	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Gordon Blower	Abstract:  Tracy and Widom showed that fundamentally important kernels in random matrix theory arise from differential equations with rational coefficients. More generally, this paper considers symmetric Hamiltonian systems abd determines the properties of kernels that arise from them. The inverse spectral problem for self-adjoint Hankel operators gives a sufficient condition for a self-adjoint operator to be the Hankel operator on $L^2(0, \infty)$ from a linear system in continuous time; thus this paper expresses certain kernels as squares of Hankel operators. For a suitable linear system $(-A,B,C)$ with one dimensional input and output spaces, there exists a Hankel operator $Γ$ with kernel $φ_{(x)}(s+t)=Ce^{-(2x+s+t)A}B$ such that $\det (I+(z-1)ΓΓ^\dagger)$ is the generating function of a determinantal random point field. 
0808.01277	Density Matrix Renormalization Group study of $^{48}$Cr and $^{56}$Ni	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:B. Thakur, S. Pittel, N. Sandulescu	Abstract:  We discuss the development of an angular-momentum-conserving variant of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method for use in large-scale shell-model calculations of atomic nuclei and report a first application of the method to the ground state of $^{56}$Ni and improved results for $^{48}$Cr. In both cases, we see a high level of agreement with the exact results. A comparison of the two shows a dramatic reduction in the fraction of the space required to achieve accuracy as the size of the problem grows. 
0808.01278	The filled skutterudite CeOs$_{4}$As$_{12}$: a hybridization gap semiconductor	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:R. E. Baumbach, P. C. Ho, T. A. Sayles, M. B. Maple, R. Wawryk, T. Cichorek, A. Pietraszko, Z. Henkie	Abstract:  X-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, magnetization, specific heat, and thermoelectric power measurements are presented for single crystals of the new filled skutterudite compound {\CeOsAs}, which reveal phenomena that are associated with f - electron - conduction electron hybridization. Valence fluctuations or Kondo behavior dominates the physics down to $T$ $\sim$ 135 K. The correlated electron behavior is manifested at low temperatures as a hybridization gap insulating state. The small energy gap $Δ$$_1$/k$_B$ $\sim$ 73 K, taken from fits to electrical resistivity data, correlates with the evolution of a weakly magnetic or nonmagnetic ground state, which is evident in the magnetization data below a coherence temperature $T$$_{coh}$ $\sim$ 45 K. Additionally, the low temperature electronic specific heat coefficient is small, $γ$ $\sim$ 19 mJ/mol K$^2$. Some results for the nonmagnetic analogue compound {\LaOsAs} are also presented for comparison purposes. 
0808.01279	Constraints on the High-Density Nuclear Equation of State from Neutron Star Observables	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:David Blaschke (Uniwersytet Wroclawski, Wroclaw, Poland & Bogoliubov Laboratory for Theoretical Physics, JINR, Dubna, Russia), Thomas Klaehn (Physics Division, ANL, Argonne, Illinois, USA), Fridolin Weber (Department of Physics, San Diego State University, San Diego, California, USA)    	Abstract:  Depending on the density reached in the cores of neutron stars, such objects may contain stable phases of novel matter found nowhere else in the Universe. This article gives a brief overview of these phases of matter and discusses astrophysical constraints on the high-density equation of state associated with ultra-dense nuclear matter. 
0808.01280	Stability of Galactic Gaseous Disks and the Formation of Massive Clusters	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Andres Escala (KIPAC, Stanford University), Richard B. Larson (Yale University)    	Abstract:  We study gravitational instabilities in disks, with special attention to the most massive clumps that form because they are expected to be the progenitors of globular-type clusters. The maximum unstable mass is set by rotation and depends only on the surface density and orbital frequency of the disk. We propose that the formation of massive clusters is related to this largest scale in galaxies not stabilized by rotation. Using data from the literature, we predict that globular-like clusters can form in nuclear starburst disks and protogalactic disks but not in typical spiral galaxies, in agreement with observations. 
0808.01281	A Partial Ordering on Slices of Planar Lagrangians	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Phil Eiseman, Jonathan D. Lima, Joshua M. Sabloff, Lisa Traynor	Abstract:  A collection of simple closed curves in $\rr^3$ is called a negative slice if it is the intersection of a flat-at-infinity planar Lagrangian surface and $\{y_2 = a \}$ for some $a < 0$. Examples and non-examples of negative slices are given. Embedded Lagrange cobordisms define a relation on slices and in some (and perhaps all) cases this relation defines a partial order. The set of slices is a commutative monoid and the additive structure has an interesting relationship with the ordering relation. 
0808.01282	Superstrings on AdS_4 x CP^3 from Supergravity	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Riccardo D'Auria, Pietro Fre', Pietro Antonio Grassi, Mario Trigiante	Abstract:  We derive from a general formulation of pure spinor string theory on type IIA backgrounds the specific form of the action for the AdS_4 x P^3 background. We provide a complete geometrical characterization of the structure of the superfields involved in the action. 
0808.01283	Peptide strings clues to the genesis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: rebuilding self-protective immunity amid fungal ruins	Subcellular Processes (q-bio.SC)	Authors:Razvan Tudor Radulescu	Abstract:  A recent application of the peptide strings concept has yielded novel perceptions on cell growth regulation, for instance that of oncoprotein metastasis. Here, this interdisciplinary approach at the boundary between physics and biology has been applied to gain a more profound insight into rheumatoid arthritis. As a result of the present investigation, this disease could be viewed as due to a metabolic dysregulation/syndrome-associated breakdown in the immunoglobulin A-based surveillance of the potentially pathogenic fungus Candida albicans that subsequently engenders a widespread self-destruction through cross-reactive auto-epitopes, ultimately amounting to the systemic predominance of a pro-inflammatory peptide string. Its therapeutic counterpart equally proposed in this report might serve as a model for future strategies against autoimmunity. 
0808.01284	Delayed X-ray emission from fallback in compact-object mergers	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Elena M. Rossi, Mitchell C. Begelman (JILA, University of Colorado)    	Abstract:  When double neutron star or neutron star-black hole binaries merge, the final remnant may comprise a central solar-mass black hole surrounded by a 0.01-0.1 solar masses torus. The subsequent evolution of this disc may be responsible for short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). A comparable amount of mass is ejected into eccentric orbits and will eventually fall back to the merger site after approximately 0.01 seconds. In this Paper, we investigate analytically the fate of the fallback matter, which may provide a luminous signal long after the disc is exhausted. We find that matter in the eccentric tail returns at a super-Eddington rate and is eventually (0.1 sec) unable to cool via neutrino emission and accrete all the way to the black hole. Therefore, contrary to previous claims, our analysis suggests that fallback matter is not an efficient source of late time accretion power and is unlikely to cause the late flaring activity observed in SGRB afterglows. The fallback matter rather forms a radiation-driven wind or a bound atmosphere. In both cases, the emitting plasma is very opaque and photons are released with a degraded energy in the X-ray band. We therefore suggest that compact binary mergers could be followed by an "X-ray renaissance", as late as several days to weeks after the merger. This might be observed by the next generation of X-ray detectors. 
0808.01285	Adiabatic fluctuations from cosmic strings in a contracting universe	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Robert H. Brandenberger, Tomo Takahashi, Masahide Yamaguchi	Abstract:  We show that adiabatic, super-Hubble, and almost scale invariant density fluctuations are produced by cosmic strings in a contracting universe. An essential point is that isocurvature perturbations produced by topological defects such as cosmic strings on super-Hubble scales lead to a source term which seeds the growth of curvature fluctuations on these scales. Once the symmetry has been restored at high temperatures, the isocurvature seeds disappear, and the fluctuations evolve as adiabatic ones in the expanding phase. Thus, cosmic strings may be resurrected as a mechanism for generating the primordial density fluctuations observed today. 
0808.01286	Instantons and SUSY breaking in F-theory	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Jonathan J. Heckman, Joseph Marsano, Natalia Saulina, Sakura Schafer-Nameki, Cumrun Vafa	Abstract:  We study instanton contributions to the superpotential of local F-theory compactifications which could potentially be used to engineer models of dynamical supersymmetry breaking. These instantons correspond to Euclidean 3-branes which form a threshold bound state with spacetime filling 7-branes. In certain cases, their contributions to the effective 4d superpotential can be determined in both perturbative string theory as well as directly via the topologically twisted theory on the 3-brane worldvolume, and in all cases we observe an exact match between these results. We further present an instanton generated Polonyi-like model, and characterize subleading corrections to the superpotential which arise from multi-instantons. We also study instanton contributions to 4d pure N=1 SU(N) gauge theory realized by a stack of 7-branes wrapping a rigid 4-cycle and find that there is a non-trivial contribution to the glueball superpotential from the single instanton sector. This correction is absent in the purely 4d theory and could conceivably be used either to stabilize moduli or to break supersymmetry. 
0808.01287	The electronic structure of the Na$_x$CoO$_2$ surface	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:D. Pillay, M.D. Johannes, I.I. Mazin	Abstract:  The idea that surface effects may play an important role in suppressing $e_g'$ Fermi surface pockets on Na$_x$CoO$_2$ $(0.333 \le x \le 0.75)$ has been frequently proposed to explain the discrepancy between LDA calculations (performed on the bulk compound) which find $e_g$' hole pockets present and ARPES experiments, which do not observe the hole pockets. Since ARPES is a surface sensitive technique it is important to investigate the effects that surface formation will have on the electronic structure of Na$_{1/3}$CoO$_2$ in order to more accurately compare theory and experiment. We have calculated the band structure and Fermi surface of cleaved Na$_{1/3}$CoO$_2$ and determined that the surface non-trivially affects the fermiology in comparison to the bulk. Additionally, we examine the likelihood of possible hydroxyl cotamination and surface termination. Our results show that a combination of surface formation and contamination effects could resolve the ongoing controversy between ARPES experiments and theory. 
0808.01288	Fragmentation Function in Non-Equilibrium QCD Using Closed-Time Path Integral Formalism	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Gouranga C Nayak (UI, Chicago)    	Abstract:  In this paper we implement Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time path integral formalism in non-equilibrium QCD to the definition of Collins-Soper fragmentation function. We consider a high p_T parton in QCD medium at initial time t_0 with arbitrary non-equilibrium (non-isotropic) distribution function f(\vec{p}) fragmenting to hadron. We formulate parton to hadron fragmentation function in non-equilibrium QCD in the light-cone quantization formalism. It may be possible to include final state interactions with the medium via modification of the Wilson lines in this definition of the non-equilibrium fragmentation function. This may be relevant to study hadron production from quark-gluon plasma at RHIC and LHC. 
0808.01289	Emergent Exoplanet Flux: Review of the Spitzer Results	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Drake Deming	Abstract:  Observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope provided the first detections of photons from extrasolar planets. Spitzer observations are allowing us to infer the temperature structure, composition, and dynamics of exoplanet atmospheres. The Spitzer studies extend from many hot Jupiters, to the hot Neptune orbiting GJ436. Here I review the current status of Spitzer secondary eclipse observations, and summarize the results from the viewpoint of what is robust, what needs more work, and what the observations are telling us about the physical nature of exoplanet atmospheres. 
0808.01290	The Dark Top	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:David Poland, Jesse Thaler	Abstract:  We present a class of composite Higgs models in which the particle that regulates the top quark contribution to the Higgs potential is also a weakly-interacting dark matter candidate. This color-neutral "dark top" is related to the standard model top quark through a large global symmetry. Because the same couplings that control the Higgs potential also determine various dark matter cross sections, the dark top scenario is quite predictive once the dark top mass and various quantum numbers are specified. We construct two concrete examples of dark top models with plausible UV completions and study their dark matter properties and LHC signatures. 
0808.01291	The Riesz energy of the $N$-th roots of unity: an asymptotic expansion for large $N$	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:J. S. Brauchart, D. P. Hardin, E. B. Saff	Abstract:  We derive the complete asymptotic expansion in terms of powers of $N$ for the Riesz $s$-energy of $N$ equally spaced points on the unit circle as $N\to \infty$. For $s\ge -2$, such points form optimal energy $N$-point configurations with respect to the Riesz potential $1/r^{s}$, $s\neq0$, where $r$ is the Euclidean distance between points. By analytic continuation we deduce the expansion for all complex values of $s$. The Riemann zeta function plays an essential role in this asymptotic expansion. 
0808.01292	High-Resolution Spectroscopy of Long-Periodic Eclipsing Binary Epsilon Aurigae	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Alex Golovin, Yuliana Kuznyetsova, Maxim Andreev	Abstract:  The results of spectroscopic observations of long-periodic eclipsing binary Epsilon Aur are reported. The observations were carried out during 2 nights in 2007 at 2-meter telescope located at the peak Terskol, Northern Caucasus (Russia). Here we present series of Epsilon Aur spectra together with EW measurements of the most prominent absorption lines. 
0808.01293	Topological Entropy of Quantum Hall States in Rotating Bose Gases	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Alexis G. Morris, David L. Feder	Abstract:  Through exact numerical diagonalization, the von Neumann entropy is calculated for the Laughlin and Pfaffian quantum Hall states in rotating interacting Bose gases at zero temperature in the lowest Landau level limit. The particles comprising the states are indistinguishable, so the required spatial bipartitioning is effected by tracing over a subset of single-particle orbitals. The topological entropy is then extracted through a finite-size scaling analysis. The results for the Laughlin and the Pfaffian states agree with the expected values of $\ln\sqrt{2}$ and $\ln\sqrt{4}$, respectively. 
0808.01294	Landau Hydrodynamics Reexamined	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Cheuk-Yin Wong	Abstract:  We review the formulation of Landau hydrodynamics and find that the rapidity distribution of produced particles in the center-of-mass system should be more appropriately modified as dN/dy \exp[\sqrt{y_b^2-y^2}], where y_b=\ln[\sqrt{s_{NN}}/m_p] is the beam nucleon rapidity, instead of Landau's original distribution, dN/dy(Landau) \exp[\sqrt{L^2-y^2}], where L=\ln[\sqrt{s_{NN}}/2m_p]. The modified distribution agrees better with experimental dN/dy data than the original Landau distribution and can be represented well by the Gaussian distribution, dN/dy(Gaussian) \exp[-y^2/2L]. Past successes of the Gaussian distribution in explaining experimental rapidity data can be understood, not because it is an approximation of the original Landau distribution, but because it is in fact a close representation of the modified distribution. Predictions for pp and AA collisions at LHC energies in Landau hydrodynamics are presented. 
0808.01295	Trapping of Nonlinear Gravitational Waves by Two-Fluid Systems	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Merab Gogberashvili, Ramaz Khomeriki	Abstract:  We show that the coupled two-fluid gravitating system (e.g. stiff matter and 'vacuum energy') could trap nonlinear gravitational waves (e.g. Einstein-Rosen waves). The gravitational wave amplitude varies harmonically in time transferring the energy coherently to the stiff matter wave, and then the process goes to the backward direction. This process mimics the behaviour of trapped electromagnetic waves in two-level media. We have defined the limits for the frequency of this energy transfer oscillations. 
0808.01296	Measurement of differential Z/gamma*+jet+X cross sections in proton anti-proton collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:D0 Collaboration: V. Abazov, et al    	Abstract:  We present new measurements of differential cross sections for Z/gamma*(->mumu)+jet+X production in a 1 fb-1 data sample collected with the D0 detector in proton anti-proton collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV. Results include the first measurements differential in the Z/gamma* transverse momentum and rapidity, as well as new measurements differential in the leading jet transverse momentum and rapidity. Next-to-leading order perturbative QCD predictions are compared to the measurements, and reasonable agreement is observed, except in the region of low Z/gamma* transverse momentum. Predictions from two event generators based on matrix elements and parton showers, and one pure parton shower event generator are also compared to the measurements. These show significant overall normalization differences to the data and have varied success in describing the shape of the distributions. 
0808.01297	Averages of b-hadron and c-hadron Properties at the End of 2007	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:E. Barberio, R. Bernhard, S. Blyth, O. Buchmueller, G. Cavoto, P. Chang, F. Di Lodovico, H. Flaecher, T. Gershon, L. Gibbons, R. Godang, B. Golob, G. Gomez-Ceballos, R. Harr, R. Kowalewski, H. Lacker, C.-J. Lin, D. Lopes-Pegna, V. Luth, D. Pedrini, B. Petersen, M. Purohit, O. Schneider, C. Schwanda, A. J. Schwartz, J. Smith, A. Snyder, D. Tonelli, S. Tosi, K. Trabelsi, P. Urquijo, R. Van Kooten, C. Voena, C. Weiser (Heavy Flavor Averaging Group)    	Abstract:  This article reports world averages for measurements of b-hadron and c-hadron properties obtained by the Heavy Flavor Averaging Group (HFAG) using the results available at the end of 2007. For the averaging, common input parameters used in the various analyses are adjusted (rescaled) to common values, and known correlations are taken into account. The averages include branching fractions, lifetimes, neutral meson mixing parameters, CP violation parameters, and parameters of semileptonic decays. 
0808.01298	Non Commutative Metrics on Quantum Families of Maps	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Maysam Maysami	Abstract:  We show that any quantum family of maps from a non commutative space to a compact quantum metric space has a canonical quantum semi metric structure. 
0808.01299	Optimal control of a stochastic network driven by a fractional Brownian motion input	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Arka P. Ghosh, Alexander Roitershtein, Ananda Weerasinghe	Abstract:  We consider a stochastic control model driven by a fractional Brownian motion. This model is a formal approximation to a queueing network with an on-off input process. We study stochastic control problems associated with the long-run average cost, the infinite horizon discounted cost, and the finite horizon cost. In addition, we find a solution to a constrained minimization problem as an application of our solution to the long-run average cost problem. We also establish Abelian limit relationships among the value functions of the above control problems. 
0808.01300	Linearized model Fokker-Planck collision operators for gyrokinetic simulations. I. Theory	Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)	Authors:I. G. Abel (Imperial), M. Barnes (Maryland), S. C. Cowley (Culham), W. Dorland (Maryland), A. A. Schekochihin (Imperial)    	Abstract:  A new analytically and numerically manageable model collision operator is developed specifically for turbulence simulations. The like-particle collision operator includes both pitch-angle scattering and energy diffusion and satisfies the physical constraints required for collision operators: it conserves particles, momentum and energy, obeys Boltzmann's H-theorem (collisions cannot decrease entropy), vanishes on a Maxwellian, and efficiently dissipates small-scale structure in the velocity space. The process of transforming this collision operator into the gyroaveraged form for use in gyrokinetic simulations is detailed. The gyroaveraged model operator is shown to have more suitable behavior at small scales in phase space than previously suggested models. A model operator for electron-ion collisions is also presented. 
0808.01301	The Future Evolution of White Dwarf Stars Through Baryon Decay and Time Varying Gravitational Constant	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jacob A. Ketchum, Fred C. Adams	Abstract:  Motivated by the possibility that the fundamental ``constants'' of nature could vary with time, this paper considers the long term evolution of white dwarf stars under the combined action of proton decay and variations in the gravitational constant. White dwarfs are thus used as a theoretical laboratory to study the effects of possible time variations, especially their implications for the future history of the universe. More specifically, we consider the gravitational constant $G$ to vary according to the parametric relation $G = G_0 (1 + t/t_\ast)^{-p}$, where the time scale $t_\ast$ is the same order as the proton lifetime. We then study the long term fate and evolution of white dwarf stars. This treatment begins when proton decay dominates the stellar luminosity, and ends when the star becomes optically thin to its internal radiation. 
0808.01302	Testing the Dark-Energy-Dominated Cosmology by the Solar-System Experiments	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yurii V. Dumin (Theoretical Department, IZMIRAN, Russian Academy of Sciences, Troitsk, Russia)    	Abstract:  According to the recent astronomical data, the most part of energy in the Universe is in the 'dark' form, which is effectively described by Lambda-term in Einstein equations. All arguments in favor of the dark energy were obtained so far from the observational data related to very large (intergalactic) scales. Is it possible to find a manifestation of the dark energy at much less scales (e.g. inside the Solar system)? 
0808.01303	The Density Matrix Renormalization Group and the Nuclear Shell Model	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:S. Pittel, B. Thakur, N. Sandulescu	Abstract:  We summarize recent efforts to develop an angular-momentum-conserving variant of the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method into a practical truncation strategy for large-scale shell model calculations of atomic nuclei. Following a brief description of the key elements of the method, we report the results of test calculations for $^{48}$Cr and $^{56}$Ni. In both cases we consider nucleons limited to the 2p-1f shell and interacting via the KB3 interaction. Both calculations produce a high level of agreement with the exact shell-model results. Furthermore, and most importantly, the fraction of the complete space required to achieve this high level of agreement goes down rapidly as the size of the full space grows. 
0808.01304	Stability of the fermionic gases close to a p-wave Feshbach resonance	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:J. Levinsen, N. R. Cooper, V. Gurarie	Abstract:  We study the stability of the paired fermionic p-wave superfluid made out of identical atoms all in the same hyperfine state close to a p-wave Feshbach resonance. First we reproduce known results concerning the lifetime of a 3D superfluid, in particular, we show that it decays at the same rate as its interaction energy, thus precluding its equilibration before it decays. Then we proceed to study its stability in case when the superfluid is confined to 2D by means of an optical harmonic potential. We find that the relative stability is somewhat improved in 2D in the BCS regime, such that the decay rate is now slower than the appropriate interaction energy scale. The improvement in stability, however, is not dramatic and one probably needs to look for other mechanisms to suppress decay to create a long lived 2D p-wave fermionic superfluid. 
0808.01305	X-ray Spectral Identification of Three Candidate Quiescent Low-Mass X-ray Binaries in the Globular Cluster NGC 6304	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Sebastien Guillot, Robert E. Rutledge, Lars Bildsten, Edward F. Brown, George G. Pavlov, Vyacheslav E. Zavlin	Abstract:  We report the search for low-mass X-ray binaries in quiescence (qLMXBs) in the globular cluster NGC 6304 using XMM observations. We present the spectral analysis leading to the identification of three candidate qLMXBs within the field of this globular cluster (GC), each consistent with the X-ray spectral properties of previously identified qLMXBs in the field and in other globular clusters -- specifically, with a hydrogen atmosphere neutron star with radius between 5--20\km. One (source 4, with R=11.7^{+8.3}_{-0.4} (D/5.97 kpc) km and kT_eff=117^{+59}_{-44} eV) is located within one core radius (r_c) of the centre of NGC 6304. This candidate also presents a spectral power-law component contributing 49 per cent of the 0.5-10 keV flux. A second one (source 9 with R=15.3^{+11.2}_{-6.5} (D/5.97 kpc) km and kT_eff=100^{+24}_{-19} eV) is found well outside the optical core (at 32 r_c) but still within the tidal radius. From spatial coincidence, we identify a bright 2MASS infrared counterpart which, at the distance of NGC 6304, seems to be a post-asymptotic giant branch star. The third qLMXB (source 5 with R=23^{+38}_{-14} (D/5.97 kpc) km and kT_eff=70^{+28}_{-20} eV) is a low signal-to-noise candidate for which we also identify from spatial coincidence a bright 2MASS infrared counterpart, with 99.916 per cent confidence. Three qLMXBs from this GC is marginally consistent with that expected from the encounter rate of NGC 6304. We also report a low signal-to-noise source with an unusually hard photon index (α=-2.0^{+1.2}_{-2.2}). Finally, we present an updated catalogue of the X-ray sources lying in the field of NGC 6304, and compare this with the previous catalogue compiled from ROSAT observations. 
0808.01306	Measurement of sigma(ppbar -> Z + X) Br(Z -> tau+tau-) at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:D0 Collaboration: V. Abazov, et al    	Abstract:  We present a measurement of the cross section for Z boson production times the branching fraction to tau lepton pairs sigma(ppbar -> Z + X) Br(Z -> tau+ tau-) in proton-antiproton collisions at center of mass energy 1.96 TeV. The measurement is performed in the channel in which one tau lepton decays into a muon and neutrinos, and the other tau lepton decays hadronically or into an electron and neutrinos. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 inverse fb collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The sample contains 1511 candidate events with an estimated 20% background from jets or muons misidentified as tau leptons. We obtain sigma Br = 240 +/- 8 (stat) +/- 12 (sys) +/- 15 (lum) pb, which is consistent with the standard model prediction. 
0808.01307	Stability of multi-dimensional viscous shocks for symmetric systems with variable multiplicities	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Toan Nguyen	Abstract:  We establish long-time stability of multi-dimensional viscous shocks of a general class of symmetric hyperbolic--parabolic systems with variable multiplicities, notably including the equations of compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in dimensions $d\ge 2$. This extends the existing result established by K. Zumbrun for systems with characteristics of constant multiplicity to the ones with variable multiplicity, yielding the first such a stability result for (fast) MHD shocks. At the same time, we are able to drop a technical assumption on structure of the so--called glancing set that was necessarily used in previous analyses. The key idea to the improvements is to introduce a new simple argument for obtaining a $L^1\to L^p$ resolvent bound in low--frequency regimes by employing the recent construction of degenerate Kreiss' symmetrizers by O. Guès, G. Métivier, M. Williams, and K. Zumbrun. Thus, at the low-frequency resolvent bound level, our analysis gives an alternative to the earlier pointwise Green's function approach of K. Zumbrun. High--frequency solution operator bounds have been previously established entirely by nonlinear energy estimates. 
0808.01308	Local structural origins of the distinct electronic properties of Nb-substituted SrTiO$_3$ and BaTi$O_3$	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Katharine Page, Taras Kolodiazhnyi, Thomas Proffen, Anthony K. Cheetham, Ram Seshadri	Abstract:  Near or less than 10% Nb substitution on the Ti site in perovskite SrTiO$_3$ results in metallic behavior, in contrast to what is seen in BaTiO$_3$. Given the nearly identical structure and electron counts of the two materials, the distinct ground states for low substitution have been a long-standing puzzle. Here we find from neutron studies of average and local structure, the subtle yet critical difference that we believe underpins the distinct electronic properties in these fascinating materials. While SrTi$_{0.875}$Nb_${0.125}$O$_3$ possesses a distorted non-cubic structure at 15 K, the BO$_6$ octahedra in the structure are regular. BaTi$_{0.875}$Nb$_{0.125}$O$_3$ on the other hand shows evidence for local cation off-centering whilst retaining a cubic structure. 
0808.01309	Universal Cycles of Restricted Classes of Words	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Arielle Leitner, Anant Godbole	Abstract:  It is well known that Universal Cycles of $k$-letter words on an $n$-letter alphabet exist for all $k$ and $n$. In this paper, we prove that Universal Cycles exist for restricted classes of words, including: non-bijections, equitable words (under suitable restrictions), ranked permutations, and "passwords". 
0808.01310	Influence of Disorder on Electron-Hole Pair Condensation in Graphene Bilayers	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:R. Bistritzer, A.H. MacDonald	Abstract:  Graphene bilayers can condense into a state with spontaneous interlayer phase coherence that supports dissipationless counterflow supercurrents. Here we address the influence of disorder on the graphene bilayer mean-field and Kosterlitz-Thouless critical temperatures and report on a simple criteria for the survival of pair condensation. 
0808.01311	Periodic resolutions and self-injective algebras of finite type	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Alex Dugas	Abstract:  We say that an algebra A is periodic if it has a periodic projective resolution as an (A,A)-bimodule. We show that any self-injective algebra of finite representation type is periodic. To prove this, we first apply the theory of smash products to show that for a finite Galois covering B --> A, B is periodic if and only if A is. In addition, when A has finite representation type, we build upon results of Buchweitz to show that periodicity passes between A and its stable Auslander algebra. Finally, we use Asashiba's classification of the derived equivalence classes of self-injective algebras of finite type to compute bounds for the periods of these algebras, and give an application to stable Calabi-Yau dimensions. 
0808.01312	Understanding adsorption of hydrogen atoms on graphene	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Simone Casolo, Ole Martin Lovvik, Rocco Martinazzo, Gian Franco Tantardini	Abstract:  Adsorption of hydrogen atoms on a single graphite sheet (graphene) has been investigated by first-principles electronic structure means, employing plane-wave based, periodic density functional theory. A reasonably large 5x5 surface unit cell has been employed to study single and multiple adsorption of H atoms. Binding and barrier energies for sequential sticking have been computed for a number of configurations involving adsorption on top of carbon atoms. We find that binding energies per atom range from ~0.8 eV to ~1.9 eV, with barriers to sticking in the range 0.0-0.2 eV. In addition, depending on the number and location of adsorbed hydrogen atoms, we find that magnetic structures may form in which spin density localizes on a $\sqrt{3}{x}\sqrt{3}{R}30^{\circ}$ sublattice, and that binding (barrier) energies for sequential adsorption increase (decrease) linearly with the site-integrated magnetization. These results can be rationalized with the help of the valence-bond resonance theory of planar $π$ conjugated systems, and suggest that preferential sticking due to barrierless adsorption is limited to formation of hydrogen pairs. 
0808.01313	Directed Transport in classical and quantum chaotic billiards	Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)	Authors:Walter Acevedo, Thomas Dittrich	Abstract:  We construct an autonomous chaotic Hamiltonian ratchet as a channel billiard subdivided by equidistant walls attached perpendicularly to one side of the channel, leaving an opening on the opposite side. A static homogeneous magnetic field penetrating the billiard breaks time-reversal invariance and renders the classical motion partially chaotic. We show that the classical dynamics exhibits directed transport, owing to the asymmetric distribution of regular regions in phase space. The billiard is quantized by a numerical method based on a finite-element algorithm combined with the Landau gauge and the Bloch formalism for periodic potentials. We discuss features of the billiard eigenstates such as node lines and vortices in the probability flow. Evidence for directed quantum transport, inherited from the corresponding features of the classical dynamics, is presented in terms of level-velocity statistics. 
0808.01314	Superfluid density near the critical temperature in the presence of random planar defects	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:D. Dalidovich, A.J. Berlinsky, C. Kallin	Abstract:  The superfluid density near the superconducting transition is investigated in the presence of spatial inhomogeneity in the critical temperature. Disorder is accounted for by means of a random $T_c$ term in the conventional Ginzburg-Landau action for the superconducting order parameter. Focusing on the case where a low-density of randomly distributed planar defects are responsible for the variation of $T_c$, we derive the lowest order correction to the superfluid density in powers of the defect concentration. The correction is calculated assuming a broad Gaussian distribution for the strengths of the defect potentials. Our results are in a qualitative agreement with the superfluid density measurements in the underdoped regime of high-quality YBCO crystals by Broun and co-workers. 
0808.01315	AMBER Task Force February 2008 run report	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:F. Malbet, G. Duvert, A. Chelli, P. Kern	Abstract:  AMBER was installed in March 2004 in the VLTI focal lab of the VLT observatory in Cerro Paranal run by ESO. Since then, there have been 4 commissioning runs and additional VLTI infrastructure installed (IRIS, FINITO and ATs,...), but AMBER is not yet fulfilling all its initial specifications and some important primary science objectives cannot be achieved. At the consortium level, an action plan has been decided in Oct 2007 that created an AMBER Task Force (ATF) to understand and possibly cure the eventual technical issues. The objectives of the February 2008 run was mainly to bring AMBER into contractual specifications the accuracy of the absolute visibility, of the differential and of the closure phase through a fundamental analysis of the instrument status and limitations. This report is the official report of the AMBER Task Force. 
0808.01316	Growth factor parametrization and modified gravity	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yungui Gong	Abstract:  The growth rate of matter perturbation and the expansion rate of the Universe can be used to distinguish modified gravity and dark energy models in explaining the cosmic acceleration. The growth rate is parametrized by the growth index $γ$. We discuss the dependence of $γ$ on the matter energy density $Ω$ and its current value $Ω_0$ for a more accurate approximation of the growth factor. The observational data, including the data of the growth rate, are used to fit different models. The data strongly disfavor the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model. For the dark energy model with a constant equation of state, we find that $Ω_0=0.27\pm 0.02$ and $w=-0.97\pm 0.09$. For the $Λ$CDM model, we find that $γ=0.64^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$. For the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model, we find that $γ=0.55^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$. 
0808.01317	Neutrino/antineutrino-$^{12}$C charged cross sections in the projected QRPA formalism	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:A. R. Samana, C. A. Bertulani, F. Krmpotic	Abstract:  The $ν/\barν-^{12}$C cross sections are evaluated in the projected quasiparticle random phase approximation (PQRPA). The cross section for $ν_e$ as a function of the incident neutrino energy is compared with recent theoretical calculations of more sophisticated models. The $\barν-^{12}$C cross section is calculated for the first time with the PQRPA. The distribution of cross sections averaged with the Michel spectrum as well as with other estimated fluxes for future experiments is compared for both $ν_e$ and $\barν_e$. Some astrophysical implications are addressed. 
0808.01318	The rationality of the moduli space of genus four curves endowed with an order three subgroup of their Jacobian	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Ingrid Bauer, Alessandro Verra	Abstract:  Refereed version to appear in Michigan Mathematical Journal. A mistake in the last section of the previous version has been corrected. The new title exactly describes the main result obtained. Building on the geometry of cubic surfaces and on a theorem of Dolgachev, the rationality of the moduli space R mentioned in the title is proved. Let M be the moduli space of 6 points in the plane, modulo the natural involution induced by double-six configurations on cubic surfaces. It is proved that R is birational to a tower of locally trivial projective bundles ending onto M. The rationality of R then follows from Dolgachev's theorem that M is rational. 
0808.01319	Cohomology algebra of the orbit space of some free actions on spaces of cohomology type (a, b)	Algebraic Topology (math.AT)	Authors:Hemant Kumar Singh, Tej Bahadur Singh	Abstract:  Let X be a finitistic space with non-trivial cohomology groups H^in(X;Z)=Z with generators v_i, where i = 0, 1, 2, 3. We say that X has cohomology type (a, b) if v_1^2 = av_2 and v_1v_2 = bv_3 . In this note, we determine the mod 2 cohomology ring of the orbit space X/G of a free action of G = Z_2 on X, where both a and b are even. In this case, we observed that there is no equivariant map S^m --> X for m > 3n, where S^m has the antipodal action. Moreover, it is shown that G can not act freely on space X which is of cohomology type (a, b) where a is odd and b is even. We also obtain the mod 2 cohomology ring of the orbit space X/G of free action of G = S^1 on the space X of type (0, b). 
0808.01320	Presentations of Semigroup Algebras of Weighted Trees	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Christopher A. Manon	Abstract:  We find presentations for subalgebras of invariants of the coordinate algebras of binary symmetric models of phylogenetic trees studied by Buczynska and Wisniewski in \cite{BW}. These algebras arise as toric degenerations of rings of global sections of weight varieties of the Grassmanian of two planes associated to the Plücker embedding, and as toric degenerations of rings of invariants of Cox-Nagata rings. 
0808.01321	Caught in formation: the nuclear-cluster-to-be in NGC 2139	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:David R. Andersen, C. Jakob Walcher, Torsten Boeker, Luis C. Ho, Roeland P. van der Marel, Hans-Walter Rix, Joseph C. Shields	Abstract:  Close to its center, the bulgeless galaxy NGC 2139 hosts a star cluster that is younger and less massive than any actual nuclear star cluster (NC) studied so far. We have measured the H-alpha velocity field around the photometric center of this galaxy using the VLT ARGUS integral field unit and GIRAFFE spectrograph in order to constrain different proposed theories of NC formation. We observe that the best-fit kinematic center and the candidate NC appear to be separated by 2.8 arcsec (320 pc). Indeed, the kinematic center also is offset from the galaxy's photometric center and a possible bar or extended region of star formation in which the young cluster resides, implying that this galaxy is not in dynamic equilibrium. The H-alpha flux map also reveals other regions of strong star formation in the possible bar. These observations suggest that a nascent NC is forming away from the kinematic center of NGC 2139 which may come to rest there on a time scale of a few 100 Myr. 
0808.01322	Coulomb Drag in the Exciton Regime in Electron-Hole Bilayers	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:J. A. Seamons, C. P. Morath, J. L. Reno, M. P. Lilly	Abstract:  We report electrical transport measurements on GaAs/AlGaAs based electron-hole bilayers. These systems are expected to make a transition from a pair of weakly coupled two-dimensional systems to a strongly coupled exciton system as the barrier between the layers is reduced. Once excitons form, phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons could be observed. In our devices, electrons and holes are confined in double quantum wells, and carriers in the devices are induced with top and bottom gates leading to variable density in each layer. Separate contact to each layer allows Coulomb drag transport measurements where current is driven in one layer while voltage is measured in the other. Coulomb drag is sensitive to interlayer coupling and has been predicted to provide a strong signature of exciton condensation. Drag measurement on EHBLs with a 30 nm barrier are consistent with drag between two weakly coupled 2D Fermi systems where the drag decreases as the temperature is reduced. When the barrier is reduced to 20 nm, we observe a consistent increase in the drag resistance as the temperature is reduced. These results indicate the onset of a much stronger coupling between the electrons and holes which leads to exciton formation and possibly phenomena related to exciton condensation. 
0808.01323	An Isotopic Fingerprint of Electron-Phonon Coupling in High-Tc Cuprates	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:H. Iwasawa, J. F. Douglas, K. Sato, T. Masui, Y. Yoshida, Z. Sun, H. Eisaki, H. Bando, A. Ino, M. Arita, K. Shimada, H. Namatame, M. Taniguchi, S. Tajima, S. Uchida, T. Saitoh, D.S. Dessau, Y. Aiura	Abstract:  Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with low-energy tunable photons along the nodal direction of oxygen isotope substituted Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta reveals a distinct oxygen isotope shift near the electron-boson coupling "kink" in the electronic dispersion. The magnitude (a few meV) and direction of the kink shift are as expected due to the measured isotopic shift of phonon frequency, which are also in agreement with theoretical expectations. This demonstrates the participation of the phonons as dominant players, as well as pinpointing the most relevant of the phonon branches. 
0808.01324	Nanoconcentration of Terahertz Radiation in Plasmonic Waveguides	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Anastasia Rusina, Maxim Durach, Keith A. Nelson, Mark I. Stockman	Abstract:  Recent years have seen an explosive research and development of nanoplasmonics in the visible and near-infrared (near-ir) frequency regions. One of the most fundamental effects in nanoplasmonics is nano-concentration of optical energy. Plasmonic nanofocusing has been predicted and experimentally achieved. It will be very beneficial for the fundamental science, engineering, environmental, and defense applications to be able to nano-concentrate terahertz radiation (frequency 1 - 10 THz or vacuum wavelength 300 - 30 microns). This will allow for the nanoscale spatial resolution for THz imaging and introduce the THz spectroscopy on the nanoscale, taking full advantage of the rich THz spectra and submicron to nanoscale structures of many engineering, physical, and biological objects of wide interest: electronic components (integrated circuits, etc.), bacteria, their spores, viruses, macromolecules, carbon clusters and nanotubes, etc. In this Letter we establish the principal limits for the nanoconcentration of the THz radiation in metal/dielectric waveguides and determine their optimum shapes required for this nanoconcentration We predict that the adiabatic compression of THz radiation from the initial spot size of light wavelength to the final size of R = 100 - 250 nm can be achieved with the THz radiation intensity increased by a factor of 10 to 250. This THz energy nanoconcentration will not only improve the spatial resolution and increase the signal/noise ratio for the THz imaging and spectroscopy, but in combination with the recently developed sources of powerful THz pulses will allow the observation of nonlinear THz effects and a carrying out a variety of nonlinear spectroscopies (such as two-dimensional spectroscopy), which are highly informative. 
0808.01325	Search for Anomalous Production of Photon, b-jet, and Missing Transverse Energy at CDF	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Shin-Shan Yu	Abstract:  We report the results of two signature-based searches for new physics using 1.9- 2.0 fb-1 of data collected at the CDF experiment. Both analyses look in events containing a photon, a b-tagged jet, and missing transverse energy. The first search requires an additional jet. The second search requires an extra electron or muon. No significant excess of events over the Standard Model prediction is observed. We also describe the "CES/CPR" method which is used to estimate the amount of mis-identified photons. 
0808.01326	Orbital-Selective Mott transition out of band degeneracy lifting	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Luca de' Medici, S.R. Hassan, Massimo Capone, Xi Dai	Abstract:  We outline a general mechanism for Orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT), the coexistence of both itinerant and localized conduction electrons, and show how it can take place in a wide range of realistic situations, even for bands of identical width and correlation, provided a crystal field splits the energy levels in manifolds with different degeneracies and the exchange coupling is large enough to reduce orbital fluctuations. The mechanism relies on the different kinetic energy in manifolds with different degeneracy. This phase has Curie-Weiss susceptibility and non Fermi-liquid behavior, which disappear at a critical doping, all of which is reminiscent of the physics of the pnictides. 
0808.01327	Addendum to: "Knots, sutures and excision"	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Yi Ni	Abstract:  We observe that the main theorem in \cite{KMsuture} immediately implies its analogue for closed 3--manifolds. 
0808.01328	Disorder effect on 3-dimensional $Z_2$ quantum spin Hall systems	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:Ryuichi Shindou, Shuichi Murakami	Abstract:  In this paper, we studied the nonmagnetic disorder effects onto the quantum critical point (QCP) which intervenes an ordinary insulator and the 3-dimensional $Z_2$ quantum spin Hall insulator. The minimal model describing this QCP is the single-copy of the 3+1 Dirac fermion, whose topological mass $m$ induces the quantum phase transition. We derived the phase diagram spanned by this mass-term $m$, chemical potential $μ$ and strength of the disorder within the self-consistent Born approximation. To infer the structure of the low-energy effective theory, we further calculated the weak localization (WL) correction to the conductivity. By way of this, we have found that the diffuson consists of the two quasi-degenerate contributions having the diffusion pole; one always behaves as the diffusion mode. The other becomes the massless mode only at $m=0$. Based on this "two-mode picture", we will discuss the possible microscopic picture of the "levitation and pair annihilation" phenomena, recently discovered by Onoda et al. 
0808.01329	Schubert polynomials and Arakelov theory of symplectic flag varieties	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Harry Tamvakis	Abstract:  Let X be the flag variety of the symplectic group. We propose a theory of combinatorially explicit Schubert polynomials which represent the Schubert classes in the Borel presentation of the cohomology ring of X. We use these polynomials to describe the arithmetic Schubert calculus on X. Moreover, we give a method to compute the natural arithmetic Chern numbers on X, and show that they are all rational numbers. 
0808.01330	Dissipative Structures in Supersonic Turbulence	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Liubin Pan, Paolo Padoan, Alexei G. Kritsuk	Abstract:  We show that density-weighted moments of the dissipation rate, $ε_l$, averaged over a scale $l$, in supersonic turbulence can be successfully explained by the She and Lévêque model [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 72}, 336 (1994)]. A general method is developed to measure the two parameters of the model, $γ$ and $d$, based directly on their physical interpretations as the scaling exponent of the dissipation rate in the most intermittent structures ($γ$) and the dimension of the structures ($d$). We find that the best-fit parameters ($γ=0.71$ and $d=1.90$) derived from the $ε_l$ scalings in a simulation of supersonic turbulence at Mach 6 agree with their direct measurements, confirming the validity of the model in supersonic turbulence. 
0808.01331	Semistar dimension of polynomial rings and Prüfer-like domains	Commutative Algebra (math.AC)	Authors:Parviz Sahandi	Abstract:  Let $D$ be an integral domain and $\star$ a semistar operation stable and of finite type on it. In this paper we define the semistar dimension (inequality) formula and discover their relations with $\star$-universally catenarian domains and $\star$-stably strong S-domains. As an application we give new characterizations of $\star$-quasi-Prüfer domains and UM$t$ domains in terms of dimension inequality formula (and the notions of universally catenarian domain, stably strong S-domain, strong S-domain, and Jaffard domains). We also extend Arnold's formula to the setting of semistar operations. 
0808.01332	Electronic transport and specific heat of 1T- VSe2	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:C.S.Yadav, A.K.Rastogi	Abstract:  The results of low temperature thermoelectric power and the specific heat of 1T-VSe2 (Vanadium diselenide) have been reported along with the electrical resistivity, and Hall coefficient of the compound. The Charge Density Wave (CDW) transition is observed near 110K temperature in all these properties. The Thermoelectric power has been measured from 15K to 300K spanning the incommensurate and commensurate CDW regions. We observed a weak anomaly at the CDW transition for the first time in the specific heat of VSe2. The linear temperature dependence of resistivity and thermoelectric power at higher temperatures suggests a normal metallic behavior and electron-phonon scattering above the CDW transition. The positive thermoelectric power and negative Hall coefficient along with strongly temperature dependent behavior in the CDW phase suggest a mixed conduction related to the strongly hybridized s-p-d bands in this compound. 
0808.01333	Transport and Magnetic Properties of FexVse2 (x = 0 - 0.33)	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:C.S.Yadav, A.K.Rastogi	Abstract:  We present our results of the effect of Fe intercalation on the structural, transport and magnetic properties of 1T-VSe2. Intercalation of iron, suppresses the 110K charge density wave (CDW) transition of the 1T-VSe2. For the higher concentration of iron, formation of a new kind of first order transition at 160K takes place, which go on stronger for the 33% Fe intercalation. Thermopower of the FexVSe2 compounds (x = 0 - 0.33), however do not show any anomaly around the transition. The intercalation of Fe does not trigger any magnetism in the weak paramagnetic 1T-VSe2, and Fe is the low spin state of Fe3+. 
0808.01334	Transport and Magnetic properties of Fe1/3VSe2	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:C. S. Yadav, A. K. Rastogi	Abstract:  Electrical conductivity, thermopower and magnetic properties of Fe-intercalated Fe0.33VSe2 has been reported between 4.2K - 300K. We observe a first order transition in the resistivity of the sintered pellets around 160K on cooling. The electronic properties including the transitional hysteresis in the resistance anomaly (from 80K-160K) are found to be very sensitive to the structural details of the samples, which were prepared in different annealing conditions. The thermopower results on the sintered pellets are reported between 10K - 300K. The magnetic measurements between 2K - 300K and up to 14 Tesla field show the absence of any magnetic ordering in Fe0.33VSe2. The magnetic moment per Fe -atom at room temperature (between 1.4 to 1.7 Bohr Magneton) is much lower than in previously reported anti-ferromagnetic FeV2Se4. Furthermore, the Curie constant shows a rapid and continuous reduction and combined with the high field magnetization result at 2K suggests a rapid decrease in the paramagnetic moments on cooling to low temperatures and the absence of any magnetic order in Fe0.33VSe2 at low temperatures. 
0808.01335	$f(R)$ gravity constrained by PPN parameters and stochastic background of gravitational waves	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:S. Capozziello, M. De Laurentis, S. Nojiri, S. D. Odintsov	Abstract:  We analyze seven different viable $f(R)$-gravities towards the Solar System tests and stochastic gravitational waves background. The aim is to achieve experimental bounds for the theory at local and cosmological scales in order to select models capable of addressing the accelerating cosmological expansion without cosmological constant but evading the weak field constraints. Beside large scale structure and galactic dynamics, these bounds can be considered complimentary in order to select self-consistent theories of gravity working at the infrared limit. It is demonstrated that seven viable $f(R)$-gravities under consideration not only satisfy the local tests, but additionally, pass the above PPN-and stochastic gravitational waves bounds for large classes of parameters. 
0808.01336	Theoretical Review on CP Violation in Rare B decays	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Cheng-Wei Chiang	Abstract:  We discuss several issues related to direct CP violation in rare $B$ meson decays. We review the use of CP asymmetries in extracting information of strong and weak phases, how the experimental data fit into the overall picture, and the current status of the $K π$ puzzle. We also examine the flavor symmetry assumption using closely related decay modes and extract the weak phase $γ$ from certain $B \to K^* π$ and $ρK$ decays. 
0808.01337	Clustering Properties of Low-Luminosity Star-Forming galaxies at z = 0.24 and 0.40 in the Subaru Deep Field	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Aki Nakajima, Yasuhiro Shioya, Tohru Nagao, Tomoki Saito, Takashi Murayama, Shunji S. Sasaki, Asuka Yokouchi, Yoshiaki Taniguchi	Abstract:  We present our analysis on the clustering properties of star-forming galaxies selected by narrow-band excesses in the Subaru Deep Field. Specifically we focus on Halpha emitting galaxies at z = 0.24 and z = 0.40 in the same field, to investigate possible evolutionary signatures of clustering properties of star-forming galaxies. Based on the analysis on 228 Halpha emitting galaxies with 39.8 < log L(Halpha) < 40.8 at z = 0.40, we find that their two-point correlation function is estimated as xi = (r/1.62^{+0.64}_{-0.50} Mpc)^{-1.84 +/- 0.08}. This is similar to that of Halpha emitting galaxies in the same Halpha luminosity range at z = 0.24, xi = (r/1.88^{+0.60}_{-0.49} Mpc)^{-1.89 +/- 0.07}. These correlation lengths are smaller than those for the brighter galaxy sample studied by Meneux et al. (2006) in the same redshift range. The evolution of correlation length between z = 0.24 and z = 0.40 is interpreted by the gravitational growth of the dark matter halos. 
0808.01338	Search for B --> K* nu anti-nu decays	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B.Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We present a search for the decays $B \to K^{*} ν\barν$ using 454$\times10^{6}$ $B \bar{B}$ pairs collected at the $Υ(4S)$ resonance with the $mbox{\slshape B\kern-0.1em{\smaller A}\kern-0.1em B\kern-0.1em{\smaller A\kern-0.2em R}}$ detector at the SLAC PEP-II $B$-Factory. We first select an event sample where one $B$ is reconstructed in a semileptonic or hadronic mode with one charmed meson. The remaining particles in the event are then examined to search for a $B \to K^{*} ν\barν$ decay. The charged $K^{*}$ is reconstructed as $ K^{*+} \to K^0_{\scriptscriptstyle S} π^{+}$ or $ K^{*+} \to K^{+} π^{0}$; the neutral $K^{*}$ is identified in the $K^{*0} \to K^{+} π^{-}$ mode. We establish upper limits at 90% confidence level of $\matchal{B}(B^{+} \to K^{*+} ν \barν) < 8 \times 10^{-5}$, $\matchal{B}(B^{0} \to K^{*0} ν\barν) < 12 \times 10^{-5}$, and $\matchal{B}(B \to K^{*} ν\barν) < 8 \times 10^{-5}$. 
0808.01339	The Archaic Universe: Big Bang, Cosmological Term and the Quantum Origin of Time in Projective Cosmology	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Ignazio Licata, Leonardo Chiatti	Abstract:  This article proposes some cosmological reflections at the qualitative and conjectural level, suggested by the Fantappie & Arcidiacono projective relativity theory. The difference will firstly be discussed between two types of singularity in this theory: geometric (de Sitter horizon) and physical (big bang, big crunch). The reasons for the existence of geometric singularities are deeply rooted in the principle of inertia and in the principle of relativity, while physical singularities are associated with the creation or destruction of matter. In this framework, quantum mechanics is introduced through a particular interpretation of Bohm holomovement. Finally, a possible mechanism is discussed for the genesis of the cosmological term. No form of inflation appears in the scenario described. 
0808.01340	Massive Boson-Fermion Degeneracy and the Early Structure of the Universe	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Costas Kounnas	Abstract:  The existence of a new kind of massive boson-fermion symmetry is shown explicitly in the framework of the heterotic, type II and type II orientifold superstring theories. The target space-time is two-dimensional. Higher dimensional models are defined via large marginal deformations of JxJ-type. The spectrum of the initial undeformed two dimensional vacuum consists of massless boson degrees of freedom, while all massive boson and fermion degrees of freedom exhibit a new Massive Spectrum Degeneracy Symmetry (MSDS). This precise property, distinguishes the MSDS theories from the well known supersymmetric SUSY-theories. Some proposals are stated in the framework of these theories concerning the structure of: (i) The Early Non-singular Phase of the Universe, (ii) The two dimensional boundary theory of AdS3 Black-Holes, (iii) Plausible applications of the MSDS theories in particle physics, alternative to SUSY. 
0808.01341	A red supergiant nebula at 25 micron: arcsecond scale mass-loss asymmetries of mu Cep	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:W.J. de Wit, R.D. Oudmaijer, T. Fujiyoshi, M.G. Hoare, M. Honda, H. Kataza, T. Miyata, Y. K. Okamoto, T. Onaka, S. Sako, T. Yamashita	Abstract:  We present diffraction limited (0.6") 24.5micron Subaru/COMICS images of the red supergiant mu Cep. We report the detection of a circumstellar nebula, that was not detected at shorter wavelengths. It extends to a radius of at least 6" in the thermal infrared. On these angular scales, the nebula is roughly spherical, in contrast, it displays a pronounced asymmetric morphology closer in. We simultaneously model the azimuthally averaged intensity profile of the nebula and the observed spectral energy distribution using spherical dust radiative transfer models. The models indicate a constant mass-loss process over the past 1000 years, for mass-loss rates a few times 10^(-7) Msun/yr. This work supports the idea that at least part of the asymmetries in shells of evolved massive stars and supernovae may be due to the mass-loss process in the red supergiant phase. 
0808.01342	Confinement Induced Quantum Phase Transition and Polarization Cooling in a Dipolar Crystal of Polar Molecules	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Yi-Ya Tian, Daw-Wei Wang	Abstract:  It is well-known that the liquid properties in a strongly confined system can be very different from their ordinary behaviors in an extended system, due to the competition between the thermal energy and the interaction energy. Here we show that, in a low-dimensional self-assembled dipolar crystal, the parabolic optical confinement potential can also strongly affect the quantum many-body properties in the low temperature regime. For example, by changing the confinement aspect ratio, the bulk of the system can undergo a quantum phase transition between a liquid state and a solid state via a nonmonotonic pattern formation of the domain wall. Furthermore, the entropy of a trapped dipolar crystal can be much larger than the liquid state in the weak dipole limit, indicating an intrinsic polarization cooling mechanism via increasing the external field. These highly correlated confinement effects are very important to the experimental preparation of a self-assembled dipolar crystal using ultracold polar molecules. 
0808.01343	Policy and Legal Challenges of Virtual Worlds and Social Network Sites	Computers and Society (cs.CY)	Authors:Holger M. Kienle, Andreas Lober, Hausi A. Müller	Abstract:  This paper addresses policy challenges of complex virtual environments such as virtual worlds, social network sites, and massive multiplayer online games. The complexity of these environments--apparent by the rich user interactions and sophisticated user-generated content that they offer--poses unique challenges for policy management and compliance. These challenges are also impacting the life cycle of the software system that implements the virtual environment. The goal of this paper is to identify and sketch important legal and policy challenges of virtual environments and how they affect stakeholders (i.e., operators, users, and lawmakers). Given the increasing significance of virtual environments, we expect that tackling these challenges will become increasingly important in the future. 
0808.01344	On Time. 6b: Quantum Mechanical Time	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:C. K. Raju	Abstract:  The existence of small amounts of advanced radiation, or a tilt in the arrow of time, makes the basic equations of physics mixed-type functional differential equations. The novel features of such equations point to a microphysical structure of time. This corresponds to a change of logic at the microphysical level. We show that the resulting logic is a quantum logic. This provides a natural and rigorous explanation of quantum interference. This structured-time interpretation of quantum mechanics is briefly compared with various other interpretations of q.m. 
0808.01345	Backreacted T-folds and non-geometric regions in configuration space	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Waldemar Schulgin, Jan Troost	Abstract:  We provide the backreaction of the T-fold doubly T-dual to a background with NSNS three-form flux on a three-torus. We extend the backreacted T-fold to include cases with a flux localized in one out of three directions. We analyze the resulting monodromy domain walls and vortices. In these backgrounds, we give an analysis of the action of T-duality on observables like charges and Wilson surfaces. We analyze arguments for the existence of regions in the configuration space of second quantized string theory that cannot be reduced to geometry. Finally, by allowing for space-dependent moduli, we find a supergravity solution which is a T-fold with hyperbolic monodromies. 
0808.01346	Biharmonic space-like hypersurfaces in pseudo-Riemannian space	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Wei Zhang	Abstract:  We classify the space-like biharmonic surfaces in 3-dimension pseudo-Riemannian space form, and construct explicit examples of proper biharmonic hypersurfaces in general ADS space. 
0808.01347	Calculation of the dynamical critical exponent in the model A of critical dynamics to order ε^4	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:L. Ts. Adzhemyan, S. V. Novikov, L. Sladkoff	Abstract:  A new method based on the R'-operation of the renormalization theory is proposed for the numerical calculation of the renormalization constants in the theory of critical behaviour. The problem of finding residues of the poles of the Green's functions at ε= 0, where ε= 4 - d, is reduced to the evaluation of multiple UV-finite integrals, which can be performed by means of standard integration programs. The method is used to calculate the renormalization group functions of the model A of critical dynamics in four-loop approximation. Dynamical exponent z of the model A is calculated in the fourth order of the ε-expansion. 
0808.01348	Enhanced spin density wave in LaOFeSb	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Chang-Youn Moon, Se Young Park, Hyoung Joon Choi	Abstract:  We predict atomic, electronic, and magnetic structures of a hypothetical compound LaOFeSb by first-principles density-functional calculations. It is shown that LaOFeSb prefers a stripe-type antiferromagnetic phase (i.e., spin density wave (SDW) phase) to the non-magnetic (NM) phase, with a larger Fe spin moment and greater SDW-NM energy difference than those of LaOFeAs. The SDW phase is found to favor the orthorhombic structure while the tetragonal structure is more stable in the NM phase. In the NM-phase LaOFeSb, the electronic bandwidth near the Fermi energy is reduced compared with LaOFeAs, indicating smaller orbital overlap between Fe $d$ states and subsequently enhanced intra-atomic exchange coupling. The calculated Fermi surface in the NM phase consists of three hole and two electron sheets, and shows increased nesting between two hole and two electron sheets compared with LaOFeAs. Monotonous changes found in our calculated material properties of LaOFePn (Pn=P, As, and Sb), along with reported superconducting properties of doped LaOFeP and LaOFeAs, suggest that doped LaOFeSb may have a higher superconducting transition temperature. 
0808.01349	Co-evolution of elliptical galaxies and their central black holes. Clues from their scaling laws	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:L. Ciotti (Dept. of Astronomy, University of Bologna, Italy)    	Abstract:  After the discovery that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are ubiquitous at the center of stellar spheroids and that their mass Mbh, in the range 10^6-10^9 Msun, is tightly related to global properties of the host stellar system, the idea of the co-evolution of elliptical galaxies and of their SMBHs has become a central topic of modern astrophysics. Here, I summarize some consequences that can be derived from the galaxy Scaling Laws (SLs) and present a coherent scenario for the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies and their central SMBHs, focusing in particular on the establishment and maintenance of their SLs. In particular, after a first observationally based part, the discussion focuses on the physical interpretation of the Fundamental Plane. Then, two important processes in principle able to destroy the galaxy and SMBH SLs, namely galaxy merging and cooling flows, are analyzed. Arguments supporting the necessity to clearly distinguish between the origin and maintenance of the different SLs, and the unavoidable occurrence of SMBH feedback on the galaxy ISM in the late stages of galaxy evolution (when elliptical galaxies are sometimes considered as ``dead, red objects''), are then presented. At the end of the paper I will discuss some implications of the recent discovery of super-dense ellipticals in the distant Universe. In particular, I will argue that, if confirmed, these new observations would lead to the conclusion that at early epochs a relation between the stellar mass of the galaxy and the mass of the central SMBH should hold, consistent with the present day Magorrian relation, while the proportionality coefficient between Mbh and the scale of velocity dispersion of the hosting spheroids should be significantly smaller than that at the present epoch. 
0808.01350	Revisiting unitarity corrections for electromagnetic processes in collisions of relativistic nuclei	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:U. D. Jentschura, K. Hencken, V. G. Serbo	Abstract:  Unitarity corrections to several electromagnetic processes in collisions of relativistic heavy nuclei are considered. They are due to the unitarity requirement for the S-matrix and correspond to the exchange of light-by-light scattering block between colliding nuclei. We obtain improved results for the corrections to e+e- and mu+mu- pair production, as well as new results for unitarity corrections to the production of photons via virtual Compton and virtual Delbruck scattering. These corrections can be numerically large; e.g., the mu+mu- pair production cross section is reduced by about 50% and the nuclear bremsstrahlung by about 15 to 20%. 
0808.01351	Unramified representations of reductive groups over finite rings	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Alexander Stasinski	Abstract:  Lusztig has given a construction of certain representations of reductive groups over finite local principal ideal rings of characteristic p, extending the construction of Deligne and Lusztig of representations of reductive groups over finite fields. We generalize Lusztig's results to reductive groups over arbitrary finite local rings. This generalization uses the Greenberg functor and the theory of group schemes over Artinian local rings. 
0808.01352	Electronic transport through a C$_{60}$ molecular bridge: The role of single and multiple contacts	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Alireza Saffarzadeh	Abstract:  The effects of different contact geometries, bond dimerization, and gate voltage on quantum transport through a C$_{60}$ molecule are studied by the Landauer-Büttiker formula based on the Green's function technique. It is shown that the number of contact points between the device electrodes and the molecule can play an important role in the electron conduction. The transmission is due to the resonant tunneling when the electrodes are contacted to one carbon atom of the molecule. In the case of multiple contacts, the interference effects are responsible for the change of the transmission through the C$_{60}$. The bond dimerization and a gate voltage shift the molecular levels and by adjusting the related parameters the electron conduction can be controlled. 
0808.01353	Development of simulation package 'ELSES' for extra-large-scale electronic-structure calculation	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Takeo Hoshi, Takeo Fujiwara	Abstract:  An early-stage version of simulation package ' ELSES' (Extra-Large-Scale Electronic-Structure calculation) is developed for electronic structure and dynamics of large systems, particularly, nm-scale or 10nm-scale systems (www.elses.jp). Input and output files are written in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) style for general users. Related pre-/post-simulation tools are also available. Practical work flow and example are described. A test calculation of GaAs bulk system is shown to demonstrate that the present code can handle systems with more than one atom species. Several future aspects are also discussed. 
0808.01354	Ockham's razor and reasoning about information flow	Logic (math.LO)	Authors:Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh	Abstract:  What is the minimal algebraic structure to reason about information flow? Do we really need the full power of Boolean algebras with co-closure and de Morgan dual operators? How much can we weaken and still be able to reason about multi-agent scenarios in a tidy compositional way? This paper provides some answers. 
0808.01355	Composition law for polarizers	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:J. Lages, R. Giust, J.-M. Vigoureux	Abstract:  The polarization process when polarizers act on an optical field is studied. We give examples for two kinds of polarizers. The first kind presents an anisotropic absorption - as in a polaroid film - and the second one is based on total reflection at the interface with a birefringent medium. Using the Stokes vector representation, we determine explicitly the trajectories of the wave light polarization during the polarization process. We find that such trajectories are not always geodesics of the Poincaré sphere as it is usually thought. Using the analogy between light polarization and special relativity, we find that the action of successive polarizers on the light wave polarization is equivalent to the action of a single resulting polarizer followed by a rotation achieved for example by a device with optical activity. We find a composition law for polarizers similar to the composition law for noncollinear velocities in special relativity. We define an angle equivalent to the relativistic Wigner angle which can be used to quantify the quality of two composed polarizers. 
0808.01356	Soft breaking of BRST invariance for introducing non-perturbative infrared effects in a local and renormalizable way	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:L. Baulieu, S. P. Sorella	Abstract:  The possibility of introducing non-perturbative infrared effects leading to a modification of the long distance behavior of gauge theories through a soft breaking of the BRST invariance is investigated. The method reproduces the Gribov-Zwanziger action describing the restriction of the domain of integration in the Feynman path integral to the Gribov region and a model for the dynamical quark mass generation is presented. The soft symmetry breaking relies on the introduction of BRST doublets and massive physical parameters, which allow one to distinguish the infrared region from the ultraviolet one, within the same theory. 
0808.01357	Resolution of Hagedorn singularity in superstrings with gravito-magnetic fluxes	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:C. Angelantonj, C. Kounnas, H. Partouche, N. Toumbas	Abstract:  We consider closed type II and orientifold backgrounds where supersymmetry is spontaneously broken by asymmetric geometrical fluxes. We show that these can be used to describe thermal ensembles with chemical potentials associated to "gravito-magnetic" fluxes. The thermal free energy is computed at the one-loop string level, and it is shown to be free of the usual Hagedorn-like instabilities for a certain choice of the chemical potentials. In the closed string gravitational sector, as well as in the open string matter sector of the proposed orientifold construction, the free energy turns out to have "Temperature duality" symmetry, ${\cal F}(T/T_H)={T^2\over T_H^2} {\cal F}(T_H/T)$, which requires interchanging the space-time spinor representations $S\leftrightarrow C$. For small temperatures, $T\to 0$, the anti-spinor $C$ decouples from the spectrum while for large temperatures, $T\to \infty$, the spinor $S$ decouples. In both limits the free energy vanishes, as we recover a conventional type II superstring theory. At the self dual point $T=T_H$, the thermal spectra of $S$ and $C$ are identical. Moreover, there are extra massless scalars in the adjoint representation of an SO(4) non-abelian gauge symmetry in the closed-string sector, and open-string massless states charged simultaneously under both the Chan-Paton and the closed-string SO(4) gauge group. 
0808.01358	Comparison results for conjugate and focal points in semi-Riemannian geometry via Maslov index	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Miguel Angel Javaloyes, Paolo Piccione	Abstract:  We prove an estimate on the difference of Maslov indices relative to the choice of two distinct reference Lagrangians of a continuous path in the Lagrangian Grassmannian of a symplectic space. We discuss some applications to the study of conjugate and focal points along a geodesic in a semi-Riemannian manifold. 
0808.01359	Compact multipliers on spaces of analytic functions	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Paweł Mleczko	Abstract:  In the paper compact multiplier operators on Banach spaces of analytic functions on the unit disk with the range in Banach sequence lattices are studied. If the domain space $X$ is such that $H_\infty\hookrightarrow X\hookrightarrow H_1$, necessary and sufficient conditions for compactness are presented. Moreover, the calculation of the Hausdorff measure of noncompactness for diagonal operators between Banach sequence lattices is applied to obtaining the characterization of compact multipliers in case the domain space $X$ satisfies $H_\infty\hookrightarrow X\hookrightarrow H_2$. 
0808.01360	Parton transverse momenta and Drell-Yan dilepton production	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Antoni Szczurek, Gabriela Ślipek	Abstract:  The differential cross section for the dilepton production is calculated including Fermi motion of hadron constituents as well as emission from the ladders in the formalism of unintegrated parton distributions. We use unintegrated parton distributions which fulfil Kwieciński evolution equations. Both zeroth- and first-order (for matrix element) contributions are included. We calculate azimuthal angular correlations between charged leptons and deviations from the $p_t(l^+) = p_t(l^-)$ relation. We concentrate on the distribution in dilepton-pair transverse momentum. We find incident energy and virtuality dependence of the distribution in transverse momentum of the lepton pair. We study also azimuthal correlations between jet and dilepton pair and correlation in the $(p_{1t}(jet),p_{2t}(l^+ l^-))$ space. The results are compared with experimental data of the R209 and UA1 collaborations. 
0808.01361	A Theory of Hypoellipticity and Unique Ergodicity for Semilinear Stochastic PDEs	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Martin Hairer, Jonathan C. Mattingly	Abstract:  We present a theory of hypoellipticity and unique ergodicity for semilinear parabolic stochastic PDEs with "polynomial" nonlinearities and additive noise, considered as abstract evolution equations in some Hilbert space. It is shown that if Hormander's bracket condition holds at every point of this Hilbert space, then a lower bound on the Malliavin covariance operator $M_t$ can be obtained. Informally, this bound can be read as "Fix any finite-dimensional projection $Π$ on a subspace of sufficiently regular functions. Then the eigenfunctions of $M_t$ with small eigenvalues have only a very small component in the image of $Π$". We also show how to use a priori bounds on the solutions to the equation to obtain good control on the dependency of the bounds on the Malliavin matrix on the initial condition. These bounds are sufficient in many cases to obtain the asymptotic strong Feller property introduced in [HairerMattingly06]. One of the main novel technical tools is an almost sure bound from below on the size of "Wiener polynomials", where the coefficients are possibly non-adapted stochastic processes satisfying a Lipschitz condition. By exploiting the polynomial structure of the equations, this result can be used to replace Norris' lemma, which is unavailable in the present context. We conclude by showing that the two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations and a large class of reaction-diffusion equations fit the framework of our theory. 
0808.01362	On observation of neutron quantum states in Earth gravitational field at Laue-Langevin Institute, Grenoble	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:Anatoli Andrei Vankov	Abstract:  The experiment performed with ultra-cold neutrons at the Laue-Langevin Institute, Grenoble, is analyzed in view of the claim that ``neutron quantum states in Earth gravitational field'' are observed. Our conclusion is that the above claim is neither theoretically nor experimentally substantiated. We also criticize the statement that ``observation of the gravitationally bound quantum states of neutrons and the related experimental techniques provide a unique tool for a broad range of investigations in fundamental physics of particles and fields''.

0808.01364	On Bounded Integer Programming	Computational Complexity (cs.CC)	Authors:Thân Quang Khoát	Abstract:  We present an efficient reduction from the Bounded integer programming (BIP) to the Subspace avoiding problem (SAP) in lattice theory. The reduction has some special properties with some interesting consequences. The first is the new upper time bound for BIP, $poly(\varphi)\cdot n^{n+o(n)}$ (where $n$ and $\varphi$ are the dimension and the input size of the problem, respectively). This is the best bound up to now for BIP. The second consequence is the proof that #SAP, for some norms, is #P-hard under semi-reductions. It follows that the counting version of the Generalized closest vector problem is also #P-hard under semi-reductions. Furthermore, we also show that under some reasonable assumptions, BIP is solvable in probabilistic time $2^{O(n)}$.

0808.01366	MUNU final results	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Zornitza Daraktchieva, for the MUNU collaboration	Abstract:  The MUNU detector has been designed to study antineutrino-electron elastic scattering at low energy. The central tracking detector is a 1 m3 Time Projection Chamber surrounded by an anti-Compton detector. In this paper the results from final analysis of the data recorded at 3-bar and 1-bar pressure are presented. At 3-bar a new upper limit on the neutrino magnetic moment < 9 x 10-11 (7 x 10-11) mu_B at 90 (68%) C.L. is derived. At 1-bar pressure electron tracks down to 80 keV are measured in the TPC. A 137Cs photopeak is reconstructed by measuring both the energy and direction of the Compton electrons in the TPC. 
0808.01367	Common Envelope Mergers: A Possible Channel for Forming Single sdB Stars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Michael Politano, Ronald E. Taam, Marc van der Sluys, Bart Willems	Abstract:  We quantify an evolutionary channel for single sdB stars based on mergers of binaries containing a red giant star and a lower mass main sequence or brown dwarf companion in our Galaxy. Population synthesis calculations that follow mergers during the common envelope phase of evolution of such systems reveal a population of rapidly rotating horizontal branch stars with a distribution of core masses between 0.32 Mo - 0.7 Mo that is strongly peaked between 0.47 Mo - 0.54 Mo. The high rotation rates in these stars are a natural consequence of the orbital angular momentum deposition during the merger and the subsequent stellar contraction of the merged object from the tip of the red giant branch. We suggest that centrifugally enhanced mass loss facilitated by the rapid rotation of these stars may lead to the formation of single sdB stars for some of these objects. 
0808.01368	On some deterministic dictionaries supporting sparsity	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Shamgar Gurevich (UC Berkeley), Ronny Hadani (University of Chicago), Nir Sochen (Tel Aviv University)    	Abstract:  We describe a new construction of an incoherent dictionary, referred to as the oscillator dictionary, which is based on considerations in the representation theory of finite groups. The oscillator dictionary consists of order of p^5 unit vectors in a Hilbert space of dimension p, where p is an odd prime, whose pairwise inner products have magnitude of at most 4/sqrt(p). An explicit algorithm to construct a large portion of the oscillator dictionary is presented. 
0808.01369	Single-flavor CSL phase in compact stars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:David Blaschke, Fredrik Sandin, Thomas Klahn, Jens Berdermann	Abstract:  We suggest a scenario where the three light quark flavors are sequentially deconfined under increasing pressure in cold asymmetric nuclear matter as e.g. in neutron stars. The basis for our analysis is a chiral quark matter model of Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type with diquark pairing in the spin-1 single flavor (CSL), spin-0 two flavor (2SC) and three flavor (CFL) channels. We find that nucleon dissociation sets in at about the saturation density, n_0, when the down-quark Fermi sea is populated (d-quark dripline) due to the flavor asymmetry induced by beta-equilibrium and charge neutrality. At about 3n_0 u-quarks appear and a two-flavor color superconducting (2SC) phase is formed. The s-quark Fermi sea is populated only at still higher baryon density, when the quark chemical potential is of the order of the dynamically generated strange quark mass. We construct two different hybrid equations of state (EoS) using the Dirac-Brueckner Hartree-Fock (DBHF) approach and the EoS by Shen et al in the nuclear matter sector. The corresponding hybrid star sequences have maximum masses of, respectively, 2.1 and 2.0 M_solar. Two- and three-flavor quark-matter phases exist only in gravitationally unstable hybrid star solutions in the DBHF case, while the Shen-based EoS produce stable configurations with a 2SC phase component in the core of massive stars. Nucleon dissociation due to d-quark drip at the crust-core boundary fulfills basic criteria for a deep crustal heating process which is required to explain superbusts as well as cooling of X-ray transients. 
0808.01370	Observation of Spin Glass Dynamics in Dilute LiHo$_x$Y$_{1-x}$F$_4$	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:J. A. Quilliam, S. Meng, C. G. A. Mugford, J. B. Kycia	Abstract:  AC susceptibility measurements are presented on the dilute, dipolar coupled, Ising magnet LiHo$_x$Y$_{1-x}$F$_4$ for a concentration $x = 0.045$. The frequency and temperature dependences of the susceptibility show characteristic glassy relaxation. The absorption spectrum is found to broaden with decreasing temperature suggesting that the material is behaving as a spin glass and not as an exotic spin liquid as was previously observed. A dynamical scaling analysis suggests a spin glass transition temperature of 42.6 mK $\pm 2$ mK with an exponent $zν= 7.8 \pm 0.23$. 
0808.01371	Iron Behaving Badly: Inappropriate Iron Chelation as a Major Contributor to the Aetiology of Vascular and Other Progressive Inflammatory and Degenerative Diseases	Other Quantitative Biology (q-bio.OT)	Authors:Douglas B. Kell	Abstract:  The production of peroxide and superoxide is an inevitable consequence of aerobic metabolism, and while these particular "reactive oxygen species" (ROSs) can exhibit a number of biological effects, they are not of themselves excessively reactive and thus they are not especially damaging at physiological concentrations. However, their reactions with poorly liganded iron species can lead to the catalytic production of the very reactive and dangerous hydroxyl radical, which is exceptionally damaging, and a major cause of chronic inflammation. We review the considerable and wide-ranging evidence for the involvement of this combination of (su)peroxide and poorly liganded iron in a large number of physiological and indeed pathological processes and inflammatory disorders, especially those involving the progressive degradation of cellular and organismal performance. These diseases share a great many similarities and thus might be considered to have a common cause (i.e. iron-catalysed free radical and especially hydroxyl radical generation). The studies reviewed include those focused on a series of cardiovascular, metabolic and neurological diseases, where iron can be found at the sites of plaques and lesions, as well as studies showing the significance of iron to aging and longevity. The effective chelation of iron by natural or synthetic ligands is thus of major physiological (and potentially therapeutic) importance. As systems properties, we need to recognise that physiological observables have multiple molecular causes, and studying them in isolation leads to inconsistent patterns of apparent causality when it is the simultaneous combination of multiple factors that is responsible. This explains, for instance, the decidedly mixed effects of antioxidants that have been observed, etc...

Lahanas, N.E. Mavromatos, D.V. Nanopoulos	Abstract:  We investigate the minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) signals at the LHC in the context of supercritical string cosmology (SSC). In this theory, the presence of a time dependent dilaton provides us with a smoothly evolving dark energy and modifies the dark matter allowed region of the mSUGRA model with standard cosmology. Such a dilaton dilutes the supersymmetric dark matter density (of neutralinos) by a factor O(10) and consequently the regions with too much dark matter in the standard scenario are allowed in the SSC. The final states expected at the LHC in this scenario, unlike the standard scenario, consist of Z bosons, Higgs bosons, and/or high energy taus. We show how to characterize these final states and determine the model parameters. Using these parameters, we determine the dark matter content and the neutralino-proton cross section. All these techniques can also be applied to determine model parameters in SSC models with different SUSY breaking scenarios. 
0808.01373	Gilbert Damping in Conducting Ferromagnets I: Kohn-Sham Theory and Atomic-Scale Inhomogeneity	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Ion Garate, Allan H. MacDonald	Abstract:  We derive an approximate expression for the Gilbert damping coefficient α_G of itinerant electron ferromagnets which is based on their description in terms of spin-density-functional-theory (SDFT) and Kohn-Sham quasiparticle orbitals. We argue for an expression in which the coupling of magnetization fluctuations to particle-hole transitions is weighted by the spin-dependent part of the theory's exchange-correlation potential, a quantity which has large spatial variations on an atomic length scale. Our SDFT result for α_G is closely related to the previously proposed spin-torque correlation-function expression. 
0808.01374	The BCS-BEC crossover and superconductivity in a lattice fermion model with hard core repulsion	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Agnieszka Kujawa	Abstract:  We have considered the BCS-BEC crossover at T=0 in the framework of a lattice fermion model (the extended Hubbard model). We have analyzed the case of on-site hard core repulsion ($U=\infty$) and intersite attraction ($W<0$) in a 3D system with extended s-wave pairing symmetry. The mechanisms of density-driven and attraction-strength-driven crossover have been analyzed. We have obtained the ground state phase diagram. The analyzed quantities are: chemical potential, order parameter, coherence length and fraction of condensed particles. 
0808.01375	Failure Processes in Elastic Fiber Bundles	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Srutarshi Pradhan, Alex Hansen, Bikas K. Chakrabarti	Abstract:  The fiber bundle model describes a collection of elastic fibers under load. the fibers fail successively and for each failure, the load distribution among the surviving fibers change. Even though very simple, the model captures the essentials of failure processes in a large number of materials and settings. We present here a review of fiber bundle model with different load redistribution mechanism from the point of view of statistics and statistical physics rather than materials science, with a focus on concepts such as criticality, universality and fluctuations. We discuss the fiber bundle model as a tool for understanding phenomena such as creep, and fatigue, how it is used to describe the behavior of fiber reinforced composites as well as modelling e.g. network failure, traffic jams and earthquake dynamics. 
0808.01376	On surfaces of general type with maximal Albanese dimension	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Steven S. Y. Lu	Abstract:  Given a minimal surface equipped with a generically finite map to an Abelian variety, we give an optimal bound on the canonical degree of a rational or an elliptic curve. As a corollary, we obtain the finiteness of rational and elliptic curves on any surface of general type with two linearly independent regular one forms. 
0808.01377	Quantum frustration of dissipation by a spin bath	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:D. D. Bhaktavatsala Rao, Heiner Kohler, Fernando Sols	Abstract:  We investigate the evolution of a central spin coupled to a spin bath without internal dynamics. We compare the cases where the bath couples to one or two components of the spin. It is found that the central spin dynamics is enhanced in the latter case, which may be interpreted as a frustration of dissipation. However, the quantum purity of the spin decays fast in both scenarios. We conclude that symmetric coupling of the bath to two orthogonal components of the spin inhibits dissipation but not decoherence. 
0808.01378	A Novel Symbolic Type Neural Network Model- Application to River Flow Forecasting	Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE)	Authors:George S. Eskander, Amir F. Atiya	Abstract:  In this paper we introduce a new symbolic type neural tree network called symbolic function network (SFN) that is based on using elementary functions to model systems in a symbolic form. The proposed formulation permits feature selection, functional selection, and flexible structure. We applied this model on the River Flow forecasting problem. The results found to be superior in both fitness and sparsity. 
0808.01379	Measurements of Branching Fractions for B+ -> rho+ gamma, B0 -> rho0 gamma, and B0 -> omega gamma	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We present branching fraction measurements for the radiative decays B+ -> rho+ gamma, B0 -> rho0 gamma, and B0 -> omega gamma. The analysis is based on a data sample of 465 million BBbar events collected with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II asymmetric B factory. We find BR(B+ -> rho+ gamma) = (1.20 +0.42 -0.37 +/-0.20) x 10^-6, BR(B0 -> rho0 gamma) = (0.97 +0.24 -0.22 +/-0.06) x 10^-6, and a 90% C.L. upper limit BR(B0 -> omega gamma) < 0.9 x 10^-6, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. We also measure the isospin-violating quantities Gamma(B+ -> rho+ gamma) / 2Gamma(B0 -> rho0 gamma) - 1 = -0.43 +0.25 -0.22 +/-0.10. 
0808.01380	Naturally Flavorful Supersymmetry at the LHC	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Yasunori Nomura, Daniel Stolarski	Abstract:  The suppression of flavor and CP violation in supersymmetric theories may be due to the mechanism responsible for the structure of the Yukawa couplings. We study model independently the compatibility between low energy flavor and CP constraints and observability of superparticles at the LHC, assuming a generic correlation between the Yukawa couplings and the supersymmetry breaking parameters. We find that the superpotential operators that generate scalar trilinear interactions are generically problematic. We discuss several ways in which this tension is naturally avoided. In particular, we focus on several frameworks in which the dangerous operators are naturally absent. These frameworks can be combined with many theories of flavor, including those with (flat or warped) extra dimensions, strong dynamics, or flavor symmetries. We show that the resulting theories can avoid all the low energy constraints while keeping the superparticles light. The intergenerational mass splittings among the sfermions can reflect the structure of the underlying flavor theory, and can be large enough to be measurable at the LHC. Detailed observations of the superparticle spectrum may thus provide new handles on the origin of the flavor structure of the standard model. 
0808.01381	Optical excitations in Sr$_{2}$CuO$_{3}$	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:K. W. Kim, G. D. Gu	Abstract:  We investigated excitation spectra of the one-dimensional chain compound Sr$_{2}$CuO$_{3}$. The small peak at 2.3 eV in the loss function was turned to correspond to the strong charge transfer transition at 1.8 eV in conductivity. It has the excitonic character expected in one dimensional extended Hubbard model of the transition from the lower Hubberd band to the Zhang-Rice singlet state. The strongest peak at 2.7 eV in the loss function is attributed to the continuum excitation of the excitonic charge transfer transition. The spectral weight sum rule is satisfied within these transitions. 
0808.01382	Dynamics of interacting phantom scalar field dark energy in Loop Quantum Cosmology	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Xiangyun Fu, Hongwei Yu, Puxun Wu	Abstract:  We study the dynamics of a phantom scalar field dark energy interacting with dark matter in loop quantum cosmology (LQC). Two kinds of coupling of the form $α{ρ_m}{\dotφ}$ (case I) and $3βH (ρ_φ+ρ_m)$ (case II) between the phantom energy and dark matter are examined with the potential for the phantom field taken to be exponential. For both kinds of interactions, we find that the future singularity appearing in the standard FRW cosmology can be avoided by loop quantum gravity effects. In case II, if the phantom field is initially rolling down the potential, the loop quantum effect has no influence on the cosmic late time evolution and the universe will accelerate forever with a constant energy ratio between the dark energy and dark matter. 
0808.01383	Single-Photon Molecular Cooling	Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)	Authors:Edvardas Narevicius, S. Travis Bannerman, Mark G. Raizen	Abstract:  We propose a general method to cool the translational motion of molecules. Our method is an extension of single photon atomic cooling which was successfully implemented in our laboratory. Requiring a single event of absorption followed by a spontaneous emission, this method circumvents the need for a cycling transition and can be applied to any paramagnetic or polar molecule. In our approach, trapped molecules would be captured near their classical turning points in an optical dipole or RF-trap following an irreversible transition process. 
0808.01384	Surface Plasma Waves Across the Layers of Intrinsic Josephson Junctions	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:V. A. Yampol'skii, D. R. Gulevich, S. Savel'ev, F. Nori	Abstract:  We predict surface electromagnetic waves propagating across the layers of intrinsic Josephson junctions. We find the spectrum of the surface waves and study the distribution of the electromagnetic field inside and outside the superconductor. The profile of the amplitude oscillations of the electric field component of such waves is peculiar: initially, it increases toward the center of the superconductor and, after reaching a crossover point, decreases exponentially. 
0808.01385	Quantum cryptography: theory and practice	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Xiongfeng Ma	Abstract:  A highly attenuated laser pulse which gives a weak coherent state is widely used in quantum key distribution (QKD) experiments. A weak coherent state has multi-photon components, which opens up a security loophole to the sophisticated eavesdropper. With a small adjustment of the hardware, we prove that the decoy state method can close this loophole and substantially improve the QKD performance. We also propose a few practical decoy state protocols, study statistical fluctuations and perform experimental demonstrations. Moreover, we apply the methods from entanglement distillation protocols based on two-way classical communication to improve the decoy state QKD performance. Furthermore, we study the decoy state methods for other single photon sources, such as triggering parametric down-conversion (PDC) source. We propose a model and post-processing scheme for the entanglement-based QKD with a PDC source. Although the model is proposed to study the entanglement-based QKD, we emphasize that our generic model may also be useful for other non-QKD experiments involving a PDC source. By simulating a real PDC experiment, we show that the entanglement-based QKD can achieve longer maximal secure distance than the single-photon-based QKD schemes. We present a time-shift attack that exploits the efficiency mismatch of two single photon detectors in a QKD system. This eavesdropping strategy can be realized by current technology. We also discuss counter measures against the attack and study the security of a QKD system with efficiency mismatch detectors. 
0808.01386	Flux-driven Josephson parametric amplifier	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:T. Yamamoto, K. Inomata, M. Watanabe, K. Matsuba, T. Miyazaki, W. D. Oliver, Y. Nakamura, J. S. Tsai	Abstract:  We have developed a Josephson parametric amplifier, comprising a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator terminated by a dc SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device). An external field (the pump, $\sim 20$ GHz) modulates the flux threading the dc SQUID, and, thereby, the resonant frequency of the cavity field (the signal, $\sim 10$ GHz), which leads to parametric signal amplification. We operated the amplifier at different band centers, and observed amplification (17 dB at maximum) and deamplification depending on the relative phase between the pump and the signal. The noise temperature is estimated to be less than 0.87 K. 
0808.01387	Hardy spaces of operator-valued analytic functions	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Zeqian Chen	Abstract:  We are concerned with Hardy and BMO spaces of operator-valued functions analytic in the unit disk of $\mathbb{C}.$ In the case of the Hardy space, we involve the atomic decomposition since the usual argument in the scalar setting is not suitable. Several properties (the Garsia-norm equivalent theorem, Carleson measure, and so on) of BMOA spaces are extended to the operator-valued setting. Then, the operator-valued $\mathrm{H}^1$-BMOA duality theorem is proved. Finally, by the $\mathrm{H}^1$-BMOA duality we present the Lusin area integral and Littlewood-Paley $g$-function characterizations of the operator-valued analytic Hardy space. 
0808.01388	Azimuthal Correlations with High-pT Multi-Hadron Cluster Triggers in Au+Au Collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 200 GeV	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:B. Haag, for the STAR Collaboration	Abstract:  Di-hadron correlation measurements have been used to probe di-jet production in collisions at RHIC. A strong suppression of the away-side high-pT yield in these measurements is direct evidence that high-pT partons lose energy as they traverse the strongly interacting medium. However, since the momentum of the trigger particle is not a good measure of the jet energy, azimuthal di-hadron correlations have limited sensitivity to the shape of the fragmentation function. We explore the possibility to better constrain the initial parton energy by using clusters of multiple high-pT hadrons in a narrow cone as the 'trigger particle' in the azimuthal correlation analysis. We present first results from this analysis of multi-hadron triggered correlated yields in Au+Au collisions at sqrt(sNN) = 200 GeV from STAR. The results are compared to Pythia calculations, and the implications for energy loss and jet fragmentation are discussed. 
0808.01389	A Formalism for Quantum Games and an Application	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Steven A. Bleiler	Abstract:  This paper presents a new mathematical formalism that describes the quantization of games. The study of so-called quantum games is quite new, arising from a seminal paper of D. Meyer \cite{Meyer} published in Physics Review Letters in 1999. The ensuing near decade has seen an explosion of contributions and controversy over what exactly a quantized game really is and if there is indeed anything new for game theory. What has clouded many of the issues is the lack of a mathematical formalism for the subject in which these various issues can be clearly and precisely expressed, and which provides a context in which to present their resolution. Such a formalism is presented here, along with proposed resolutions to some of the issues discussed in the literature. One in particular, the question of whether there can exist equilibria in a quantized version of a game that do not correspond to classical correlated equilibria of that game and also deliver better payoffs than the classical correlated equilibria is answered in the affirmative for the Prisoner's Dilemma and Simplified Poker. 
0808.01390	Heavy anion solvation of polarity fluctuations in Pnictides	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:G.A. Sawatzky, I.S. Elfimov, J. van den Brink, J. Zaanen	Abstract:  Once again the condensed matter world has been surprised by the discovery of yet another class of high temperature superconductors. The discovery of iron-pnictide (FeAs) and chalcogenide (FeSe) based superconductors with a $T_c$ of up to 55 K is again evidence of how complex the many body problem really is, or in another view how resourceful nature is. The first reactions would of course be that these new materials must in some way be related to the copper-oxide based superconductors for which a large number of theories exist although a general consensus regarding the correct theory has not yet been reached. Here we point out that the basic physical paradigm of the new iron based superconductors is entirely different from the cuprates. Their fundamental properties, structural and electronic, are dominated by the exceptionally large pnictide polarizabilities. 
0808.01391	Octonionization of three player, two strategy maximally entangled quantum games	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Aden Ahmed, Steve Bleiler, Faisal Shah Khan	Abstract:  We develop an octonionic representation of the payoff function for three player, two strategy, maximally entangled quantum games in order to obtain computationally friendly version of this function. This computational capability is then exploited to analyze and potentially classify the Nash equilibria in the quantum games. 
0808.01392	Quantum error correcting codes based on privacy amplification	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Zhicheng Luo	Abstract:  Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) quantum error-correcting codes are based on pairs of classical codes which are mutually dual containing. Explicit constructions of such codes for large blocklengths and with good error correcting properties are not easy to find. In this paper we propose a construction of CSS codes which combines a classical code with a two-universal hash function. We show, using the results of Renner and Koenig, that the communication rates of such codes approach the hashing bound on tensor powers of Pauli channels in the limit of large block-length. While the bit-flip errors can be decoded as efficiently as the classical code used, the problem of efficiently decoding the phase-flip errors remains open. 
0808.01393	Effective slip over superhydrophobic surfaces in thin channels	Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)	Authors:François Feuillebois (ESPCI), Martin Z. Bazant (MIT, Stanford, ESPCI), Olga I. Vinogradova (Russian Academy of Sciences, ESPCI)    	Abstract:  Superhydrophobic surfaces reduce drag by combining hydrophobicity and roughness to trap gas bubbles in a micro- and nanoscopic texture. Recent work has focused on specific cases, such as striped grooves or arrays of pillars, with limited theoretical guidance. Here, we consider the experimentally relevant limit of thin channels and obtain rigorous bounds on the effective slip length for any two-component (e.g. low-slip and high-slip) texture with given area fractions. Among all anisotropic textures, parallel stripes attain the largest (or smallest) possible slip in a straight, thin channel for parallel (or perpendicular) orientation with respect to the mean flow. For isotropic (e.g. chessboard or random) textures, the Hashin-Strikman conditions further constrain the effective slip. These results provide a framework for the rational design of superhydrophobic surfaces. 
0808.01394	Massive Gravity in Curved Cosmological Backgrounds	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Masahiro Maeno, Ichiro Oda	Abstract:  We study the physical propagating modes in a massive gravity model in curved cosmological backgrounds, which we have found as classical solutions in our previous paper. We show that, generically, there exist such the cosmological background solutions consistent with the equations of motion where we assume the ghost condensation ansatzes. Using the (1+3)-parametrization of the metric fluctuations with 'unitary' gauge, we find that there is neither a scalar ghost nor a tachyon in the spectrum of the propagating modes, the tensor modes become massive owing to gravitational Higgs mechanism, and the model is free of the Boulware-Deser instability. The price we have to pay is that the scalar sector breaks the Lorentz-invariance, but there are no pathologies in the spectrum and lead to interesting phenomenology. Moreover, we present a proof of the absence of non-unitary modes for a specific ghost condensation model in a cosmological background. 
0808.01395	Algebraic topology from geometric viewpoint	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:A. Skopenkov	Abstract:  This book is expository and is in Russian. It is shown how in the course of solution of interesting geometric problems (close to applications) naturally appear main notions of algebraic topology (homology groups, obstructions and invariants, characteristic classes). Thus main ideas of algebraic topology are presented with minimal technicalities. Familiarity of a reader with basic notions of topology (such as 2-dimensional manifolds and vector fields) is desirable, although definitions are given at the beginning. The book is accessible to undergraduates and could also be an interesting easy reading for professional mathematicians. 
0808.01396	Low frequency elastic wave propagation in 2D locally resonant phononic crystal with asymmetric resonator	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Yongwei Gu, Xudong Luo, Hongru Ma	Abstract:  The resonance modes and the related effects to the transmission of elastic waves in a two dimensional phononic crystal formed by periodic arrangements of a two blocks unit cell in one direction are studied. The unit cell consists of two asymmetric elliptic cylinders coated with silicon rubber and embedded in a rigid matrix. The modes are obtained by the semi-analytic method in the least square collocation scheme and confirmed by the finite element method simulations. Two resonance modes, corresponding to the vibration of the cylinder along the long and short axes, give rise to resonance reflections of elastic waves. One mode in between the two modes, related to the opposite vibration of the two cylinders in the unit cell in the direction along the layer, results in the total transmission of elastic waves due to zero effective mass density at the frequency. The resonance frequency of this new mode changes continuously with the orientation angle of the elliptic resonator. 
0808.01397	Characterization of integrated optics components for the second generation of VLTI instruments	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Lacour, L. Jocou, T. Moulin, P. R. Labeye, M. Benisty, J.-P. Berger, A. Delboulbe, X. Haubois, E. Herwats, P. Y. Kern, F. Malbet, K. Rousselet-Perraut, G. Perrin	Abstract:  Two of the three instruments proposed to ESO for the second generation instrumentation of the VLTI would use integrated optics for beam combination. Several design are studied, including co-axial and multi-axial recombination. An extensive quantity of combiners are therefore under test in our laboratories. We will present the various components, and the method used to validate and compare the different combiners. Finally, we will discuss the performances and their implication for both VSI and Gravity VLTI instruments. 
0808.01398	Pesin-Type Identity for Weak Chaos	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Nickolay Korabel, Eli Barkai	Abstract:  Pesin's identity provides a profound connection between entropy $h_{KS}$ (statistical mechanics) and the Lyapunov exponent $λ$ (chaos theory). It is well known that many systems exhibit sub-exponential separation of nearby trajectories and then $λ=0$. In many cases such systems are non-ergodic and do not obey usual statistical mechanics. Here we investigate the non-ergodic phase of the Pomeau-Manneville map where separation of nearby trajectories follows $δx_t= δx_0 e^{λ_α t^α}$ with $0<α<1$. The limit distribution of $λ_α$ is the inverse L{é}vy function. The average $< λ_α >$ is related to the infinite invariant density, and most importantly to entropy. Our work gives a generalized Pesin's identity valid for systems with an infinite invariant density. 
0808.01399	Formation of guided spin-wave bullets in ferrimagnetic film stripes	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:A.A. Serga, M.P. Kostylev, B. Hillebrands	Abstract:  The formation of quasi-2D nonlinear spin-wave eigenmodes in longitudinally magnetized stripes of a ferrimagnetic film, so-called guided spin-wave bullets, was experimentally observed by using time- and space-resolved Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy and confirmed by numerical simulation. They represent stable spin-wave packets propagating along a waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction with the side edges of the waveguide are important. The experiments and the numerical simulation of the evolution of the spin-wave excitations show that the shape of the formed packets and their behavior are strongly influenced by the confinement conditions. The discovery of these modes demonstrates the existence of quasi-stable nonlinear solutions in the transition regime between one-dimensional and two-dimensional wave packet propagation. 
0808.01400	A Class of Maximal-Rate, Low-PAPR, Non-square Complex Orthogonal Designs	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Smarajit Das, B. Sundar Rajan	Abstract:  Space-time block codes (STBCs) from non-square complex orthogonal designs are bandwidth efficient when compared with those from square real/complex orthogonal designs. Though there exists rate-1 ROD for any number of transmit antennas, rate-1 complex orthogonal designs (COD) does not exist for more than 2 transmit antennas. Liang (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 2003) and Lu et al (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 2005) have constructed a class of maximal rate non-square CODs where the rate is ${1/2}+\frac{1}{n}$ if number of transmit antennas $n$ is even and ${1/2}+\frac{1}{n+1}$ if $n$ is odd. In this paper, we present a simple construction for maximal rate non-square CODs obtained from square CODs which resembles the construction of rate-1 non-square RODs from square RODs. These designs are shown to be amenable for construction of a class of generalized CODs (called Coordinate-Interleaved Scaled CODs) with low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) having the same parameters as the maximal rate codes. Simulation results indicate that these codes perform better than the existing maximal rate codes under peak power constraint while performing the same under average power constraint. 
0808.01401	Coupled Painlevé VI systems in dimension four with affine Weyl group symmetry of type $E_6^{(2)}$	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Yusuke Sasano	Abstract:  We find a four-parameter family of coupled Painlevé VI systems in dimension four with affine Weyl group symmetry of type $E_6^{(2)}$. This is the first example which gave higher order Painlevé type systems of type $E_{6}^{(2)}$. We study its symmetry and holomorphy conditions.

0808.01403	Circle correspondence $C^*$-algebras	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Shinji Yamashita	Abstract:  We investigate Cuntz-Pimsner $C^*$-algebras associated with certain correspondences of the unit circle $\mathbb{T}$. We analyze these $C^*$-algebras by analogy with irrational rotation algebras $A_θ$ and Cuntz algebras $\mathcal{O}_n$. We construct a Rieffel type projection, study the fixed point algebras of certain actions of finite groups, and calculate the entropy of a certain endomorphism. We also study the induced map of the dual action of the gauge action on $K$-groups. 
0808.01404	Weighted Semigroup Algebras as Dual Banach algebras	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:M. Abolghasemi, A. Rejali, H. R. E. Vishki	Abstract:  In this paper, among other things, we study those conditions under which the weighted semigroup algebra $\ell^1(S,ω)$ is a dual Banach algebra with respect to predual $c_0(S)$. Some useful examples, illustrating the results, are also included. 
0808.01405	Manifestations of String Theory in Astrophysical Data and at the LHC	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Satoshi Nawata	Abstract:  With the advent of the LHC and the continuing influx of cosmological data, phenomenological aspects of string theory have received renewed attention in recent years and many problems have been properly incorporated in this framework. In this Dissertation, we suggest new string-related candidates for the origin of dark energy and dark matter and propose ways of searching for string resonances at the LHC. 
0808.01406	Propagation and Ghosts in the Classical Kagome Antiferromagnet	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:J. Robert, B. Canals, V. Simonet, R. Ballou	Abstract:  We investigate the classical spin dynamics of the kagome antiferromagnet by combining Monte Carlo and spin dynamics simulations. We show that this model has two distinct low temperature dynamical regimes, both sustaining propagative modes. The expected gauge invariance type of the low energy low temperature out of plane excitations is also evidenced in the non linear regime. A detailed analysis of the excitations allows to identify ghosts in the dynamical structure factor, i.e propagating excitations with a strongly reduced spectral weight. We argue that these dynamical extinction rules are of geometrical origin. 
0808.01407	Simulations of the formation of a gaseous disc and young stars near Sgr A* via cloud-cloud collisions	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Sergei Nayakshin, Alexander Hobbs	Abstract:  Young massive stars in the central parsec of our Galaxy are best explained by star formation within at least one, and possibly two, massive self-gravitating gaseous discs. With help of numerical simulations, we here consider whether the observed population of young stars could have originated from a large angle collision of two massive gaseous clouds at R ~ 1 pc from Sgr A*. In all the simulations performed, the post-collision gas flow forms an inner nearly circular gaseous disc and one or two eccentric outer filaments, consistent with the observations. Furthermore, the radial stellar mass distribution is always very steep, sigma proportional to R^-2, again consistent with the data. The 3D velocity structure of the stellar distribution is however sensitive to initial conditions (e.g., the impact parameter of the clouds) and gas cooling details. In all the cases the amount of gas accreted by our inner boundary condition is large, enough to allow Sgr A* to radiate near its Eddington limit during ~ 10^5 years. This suggests that a refined model would have physically larger clouds (or a cloud and a disc such as the CND) colliding at a distance of a few pc rather than 1 pc as in our simulations. 
0808.01408	There are infinitely many prime numbers in all arithmetic progressions with first term and difference coprime	History and Overview (math.HO)	Authors:Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet	Abstract:  Dirichlet's proof of infinitely many primes in arithmetic progressions was published in 1837, introduced L-series for the first time, and it is said to have started rigorous analytic number theory. Dirichlet uses Euler's earlier work on the zeta function and the distribution of primes. He first proves a simpler case before going to full generality. The paper was translated from German by R. Stephan and given a reference section. 
0808.01409	New Tests of Spatial Segregation Based on Nearest Neighbor Contingency Tables	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:Elvan Ceyhan	Abstract:  The spatial clustering of points from two or more classes (or species) has important implications in many fields and may cause the spatial patterns of segregation and association, which are two major types of spatial interaction between the classes. The null patterns we consider are random labeling (RL) and complete spatial randomness (CSR) of points from two or more classes, which is called CSR independence. The segregation and association patterns can be studied using a nearest neighbor contingency table (NNCT) which is constructed using the frequencies of nearest neighbor (NN) types in a contingency table. Among NNCT-tests Pielou's test is liberal the null pattern but Dixon's test has the desired significance level under the RL pattern. We propose three new multivariate clustering tests based on NNCTs. We compare the finite sample performance of these new tests with Pielou's and Dixon's tests and Cuzick & Edward's k-NN tests in terms of empirical size under the null cases and empirical power under various segregation and association alternatives and provide guidelines for using the tests in practice. We demonstrate that the newly proposed NNCT-tests perform relatively well compared to their competitors and illustrate the tests using three example data sets. Furthermore, we compare the NNCT-tests with the second-order methods using these examples. 
0808.01410	Image Steganography, a New Approach for Transferring Security Information	Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)	Authors:H. B. Bahar, Ali Aboutalebi	Abstract:  Steganography is the art of hiding the fact that communication is taking place, by hiding information in other information. Many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency on the Internet. For hiding secret information in images, there exists a large variety of steganographic techniques some are more complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points. Different applications have different requirements of the steganography technique used. For example, some applications may require absolute invisibility of the secret information, while others require a larger secret message to be hidden. This paper intends to give an overview of image steganography, its uses and techniques. It also attempts to identify the requirements of a good steganographic algorithm and briefly reflects on which steganographic techniques are more suitable for which applications. 
0808.01411	Metastable superpositions of ortho- and para-Helium states	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Pedro Sancho, Luis Plaja	Abstract:  We analyze superpositions of ortho- and para-Helium states, considering the possible existence of stationary and metastable states in the system. In particular, the metastable superposition of 1s2s ortho and para states seems to be accessible to experimental scrutiny. 
0808.01412	Frames and Oversampling Formulas for Band Limited Functions	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Vincenza Del Prete	Abstract:  In this article we obtain families of frames for the space B_ωof functions with band in [-ω,ω] by using the theory of shift-invariant spaces. Our results are based on the Gramian analysis of A. Ron and Z. Shen and a variant, due to Bownik, of their characterization of families of functions whose shifts form frames or Riesz bases. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the translates of a finite number of functions (generators) to be a frame or a Riesz basis for B_ω. We also give explicit formulas for the dual generators and we apply them to Hilbert transform sampling and derivative sampling. Finally, we provide numerical experiments which support the theory. 
0808.01413	The interface structure of epitaxial graphene grown on 4H-SiC(0001)	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:J. Hass, J.E. Millan-Otoya, P. N. First, E. H. Conrad	Abstract:  We present a structural analysis of the graphene-4HSiC(0001) interface using surface x-ray reflectivity. We find that the interface is composed of an extended reconstruction of two SiC bilayers. The interface directly below the first graphene sheet is an extended layer that is more than twice the thickness of a bulk SiC bilayer (~1.7A compared to 0.63A). The distance from this interface layer to the first graphene sheet is much smaller than the graphite interlayer spacing but larger than the same distance measured for graphene grown on the (000-1) surface, as predicted previously by ab intio calculations. 
0808.01414	Spectroscopic and Photometric evidence of two stellar populations in the Galactic Globular Cluster NGC6121 (M4)	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. F. Marino, S. Villanova, G. Piotto, A. P. Milone, Y. Momany, L. R. Bedin, A. M. Medling	Abstract:  AIMS. We present abundance analysis based on high resolution spectra of 105 isolated red giant branch (RGB) stars in the Galactic Globular Cluster NGC 6121 (M4). Our aim is to study its star population in the context of the multi-population phenomenon recently discovered to affect some Globular Clusters. METHODS. The data have been collected with FLAMES+UVES, at the ESO/VLT@UT2 telescope. Analysis was performed under LTE approximation for the following elements: O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Ba, and NLTE corrections were applied to Na and Mg. Spectroscopic data were coupled with high-precision wide-field UBVI$_{\rm C}$ photometry from WFI@2.2m telescope and infrared JHK photometry from 2MASS. RESULTS: We derived an average $\rm {[Fe/H]}=-1.07\pm0.01$ (internal error), and an $α$ enhancement of $\rm {[α/Fe]}=+0.39\pm0.05$ dex (internal error). We confirm the presence of an extended Na-O anticorrelation, and find two distinct groups of stars with significantly different Na and O content. We find no evidence of a Mg-Al anticorrelation. By coupling our results with previous studies on the CN band strength, we find that the CN strong stars have higher Na and Al content and are more O depleted than the CN weak ones. The two groups of Na-rich, CN-strong and Na-poor, CN-weak stars populate two different regions along the RGB. In the $\rm {U}$ vs. $\rm {U-B}$ color magnitude diagram the RGB spread is present rom the base of the RGB to the RGB-tip. Apparently, both spectroscopic and photometric results imply the presence of two stellar populations in M4. We briefly discuss the possible origin of these populations. 
0808.01415	On the potential catastrophic risk from metastable quantum-black holes produced at particle colliders	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:R. Plaga	Abstract:  The question of whether collider produced of subnuclear black holes might constitute a catastrophic risk is explored in a model of Casadio & Harms (2002) that treats them as quantum-mechanical objects. A plausible scenario in which these black holes accrete ambient matter at the Eddington limit shortly after their production, thereby emitting Hawking radiation that would be harmful to Earth and/or CERN and its surroundings, is described. Such black holes are shown to remain undetectable in existing astrophysical observations and thus evade a recent exclusion of risks from subnuclear black holes by Giddings & Mangano (2008) and and a similar one by Koch et al. (2009). I further question that these risk analyses are complete for the reason that they exclude plausible black-hole parameter ranges from safety consideration without giving any reason. Some feasible operational measures at colliders are proposed that would allow the lowering of any remaining risk probability. Giddings & Mangano drew different general conclusions only because they made different initial assumptions about the properties of microscopic black holes, not because any of their technical conclusions are incorrect. A critical comment by Giddings & Mangano (2008) on the present paper and a preprint by Casadio et al.(2009) - that presents a treatment of the present issue with methods and assumptions similar to mine - are addressed in appendices. 
0808.01416	Model selection for density estimation with L2-loss	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Lucien Birgé	Abstract:  We consider here estimation of an unknown probability density s belonging to L2(mu) where mu is a probability measure. We have at hand n i.i.d. observations with density s and use the squared L2-norm as our loss function. The purpose of this paper is to provide an abstract but completely general method for estimating s by model selection, allowing to handle arbitrary families of finite-dimensional (possibly non-linear) models and any density s belonging to L2(mu). We shall, in particular, consider the cases of unbounded densities and bounded densities with unknown bound and investigate how the L-infinity-norm of s may influence the risk. We shall also provide applications to adaptive estimation and aggregation of preliminary estimators. Although of a purely theoretical nature, our method leads to results that cannot presently be reached by more concrete methods. 
0808.01417	The finite harmonic oscillator and its associated sequences	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Shamgar Gurevich, Ronny Hadani, Nir Sochen	Abstract:  A system of functions (signals) on the finite line, called the oscillator system, is described and studied. Applications of this system for discrete radar and digital communication theory are explained. Keywords: Weil representation, commutative subgroups, eigenfunctions, random behavior, deterministic construction 
0808.01418	Comprehensive quantum Monte Carlo study of the quantum critical points in planar dimerized/quadrumerized Heisenberg models	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Sandro Wenzel, Wolfhard Janke	Abstract:  We study two planar square lattice Heisenberg models with explicit dimerization or quadrumerization of the couplings in the form of ladder and plaquette arrangements. We investigate the quantum critical points of those models by means of (stochastic series expansion) quantum Monte Carlo simulations as a function of the coupling ratio $α= J^\prime/J$. The critical point of the order-disorder quantum phase transition in the ladder model is determined as $α_\mathrm{c} = 1.9096(2)$ improving on previous studies. For the plaquette model we obtain $α_\mathrm{c} = 1.8230(2)$ establishing a first benchmark for this model from quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Based on those values we give further convincing evidence that the models are in the three-dimensional (3D) classical Heisenberg universality class. The results of this contribution shall be useful as references for future investigations on planar Heisenberg models such as concerning the influence of non-magnetic impurities at the quantum critical point. 
0808.01419	Gerbe-holonomy for surfaces with defect networks	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Ingo Runkel, Rafal R. Suszek	Abstract:  We define the sigma-model action for world-sheets with embedded defect networks in the presence of a three-form field strength. We derive the defect gluing condition for the sigma-model fields and their derivatives, and use it to distinguish between conformal and topological defects. As an example, we treat the WZW model with defects labelled by elements of the centre Z(G) of the target Lie group G; comparing the holonomy for different defect networks gives rise to a 3-cocycle on Z(G). Next, we describe the factorisation properties of two-dimensional quantum field theories in the presence of defects and compare the correlators for different defect networks in the quantum WZW model. This, again, results in a 3-cocycle on Z(G). We observe that the cocycles obtained in the classical and in the quantum computation are cohomologous. 
0808.01420	59-Co and 75-As NMR Investigation of Electron-Doped High Tc Superconductor BaFe(1.8)Co(0.2)As(2) (Tc = 22K)	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:F.L. Ning, K. Ahilan, T. Imai, A. S. Sefat, R. Jin, M. A. McGuire, B. C. Sales, D. Mandrus	Abstract:  We report an NMR investigation of the superconductivity in BaFe(2)As(2) induced by Co doping (Tc=22K). We demonstrate that Co atoms form an alloy with Fe atoms and donate carriers without creating localized moments. Our finding strongly suggests that the underlying physics of iron-pnictide superconductors is quite different from the widely accepted physical picture of high Tc cuprates as doped Mott insulators. We also show a crossover of electronic properties into a low temperature pseudo-gap phase with a pseudo-gap Delta 560K, where chi(spin) constant and resisitivty T. The NMR Knight shift below Tc decreases for both along the c-axis and ab-plane, and is consistent with the singlet pairing scenario. 
0808.01421	All-particle primary energy spectrum in the 3-200 PeV energy range	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A.P. Garyaka, R.M. Martirosov, S.V. Ter-Antonyan, A.D. Erlykin, N.M. Nikolskaya, Y.A. Gallant, L.W. Jones, J. Procureur	Abstract:  We present all-particle primary cosmic-ray energy spectrum in the 3-200 PeV energy range obtained by a multi-parametric event-by-event evaluation of the primary energy. The results are obtained on the basis of an expanded EAS data set detected at mountain level (700 g/cm^2) by the GAMMA experiment. The energy evaluation method has been developed using the EAS simulation with the SIBYLL interaction model taking into account the response of GAMMA detectors and reconstruction uncertainties of EAS parameters. Nearly unbiased (<5%) energy estimations regardless of a primary nuclear mass with an accuracy of about 15-10% in the 3-200 PeV energy range respectively are attained. An irregularity ('bump') in the spectrum is observed at primary energies of ~74 PeV. This bump exceeds a smooth power-law fit to the data by about 4 standard deviations. Not rejecting stochastic nature of the bump completely, we examined the systematic uncertainties of our methods and conclude that they cannot be responsible for the observed feature. 
0808.01422	Maslov class rigidity for Lagrangian submanifolds via Hofer's geometry	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Ely Kerman, Nil I. Sirikci	Abstract:  In this work, we establish new rigidity results for the Maslov class of Lagrangian submanifolds in large classes of closed and convex symplectic manifolds. Our main result establishes upper bounds for the minimal Maslov number of displaceable Lagrangian submanifolds which are product manifolds whose factors each admit a metric of negative sectional curvature. Such Lagrangian submanifolds exist in every symplectic manifold of dimension greater than six or equal to four. The proof utilizes the relations between closed geodesics on the Lagrangian, the periodic orbits of geometric Hamiltonian flows supported near the Lagrangian, and the length minimizing properties of these flows with respect to the negative Hofer length functional. 
0808.01423	Large-scale magnetic topologies of mid-M dwarfs	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. Morin, J.-F. Donati, P. Petit, X. Delfosse, T. Forveille, L. Albert, M. Auriere, R. Cabanac, B. Dintrans, R. Fares, T. Gastine, M.M. Jardine, F. Lignieres, F. Paletou, J.C. Ramirez Velez, S. Theado	Abstract:  We present in this paper the first results of a spectropolarimetric analysis of a small sample (~ 20) of active stars ranging from spectral type M0 to M8, which are either fully-convective or possess a very small radiative core. This study aims at providing new constraints on dynamo processes in fully-convective stars. The present paper focuses on 5 stars of spectral type ~M4, i.e. with masses close to the full convection threshold (~ 0.35 Msun), and with short rotational periods. Tomographic imaging techniques allow us to reconstruct the surface magnetic topologies from the rotationally modulated time-series of circularly polarised profiles. We fnd that all stars host mainly axisymmetric large-scale poloidal fields. Three stars were observed at two different epochs separated by ~1 yr; we find the magnetic topologies to be globally stable on this timescale. We also provide an accurate estimation of the rotational period of all stars, thus allowing us to start studying how rotation impacts the large-scale magnetic field. 
0808.01424	Holographic Dark Energy Model and Scalar-Tensor Theories	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Yousef Bisabr	Abstract:  We study the holographic dark energy model in a generalized scalar tensor theory. In a universe filled with cold dark matter and dark energy, the effect of potential of the scalar field is investigated in the equation of state parameter. We show that for a various types of potentials, the equation of state parameter is negative and transition from deceleration to acceleration expansion of the universe is possible. 
0808.01425	Superconductivity coexisting with phase-separated static magnetic order in (Ba,K)Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$, (Sr,Na)Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ and CaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:T. Goko, A. A. Aczel, E. Baggio-Saitovitch, S. L. Bud'ko, P. C. Canfield, J. P. Carlo, G. F. Chen, Pengcheng Dai, A. C. Hamann, W. Z. Hu, H. Kageyama, G. M. Luke, J. L. Luo, B. Nachumi, N. Ni, D. Reznik, D. R. Sanchez-Candela, A. T. Savici, K. J. Sikes, N. L. Wang, C. R. Wiebe, T. J. Williams, T. Yamamoto, W. Yu, Y. J. Uemura	Abstract:  The recent discovery and subsequent developments of FeAs-based superconductors have presented novel challenges and opportunities in the quest for superconducting mechanisms in correlated-electron systems. Central issues of ongoing studies include interplay between superconductivity and magnetism as well as the nature of the pairing symmetry reflected in the superconducting energy gap. In the cuprate and RE(O,F)FeAs (RE = rare earth) systems, the superconducting phase appears without being accompanied by static magnetic order, except for narrow phase-separated regions at the border of phase boundaries. By muon spin relaxation measurements on single crystal specimens, here we show that superconductivity in the AFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ (A = Ca,Ba,Sr) systems, in both the cases of composition and pressure tunings, coexists with a strong static magnetic order in a partial volume fraction. The superfluid response from the remaining paramagnetic volume fraction of (Ba$_{0.5}$K$_{0.5}$)Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ exhibits a nearly linear variation in T at low temperatures, suggesting an anisotropic energy gap with line nodes and/or multi-gap effects. 
0808.01426	Topological quantum phase transitions of ultracold fermions in optical lattices	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:R. W. Cherng, C. A. R. Sá de Melo	Abstract:  We consider the possibility of topological quantum phase transitions of ultracold fermions in optical lattices, which can be studied as a function of interaction strength or atomic filling factor (density). The phase transitions are connected to the topology of the elementary excitation spectrum, and occur only for non-zero angular momentum pairing (p-wave, d-wave and f-wave), while they are absent for s-wave. We construct phase diagrams for the specific example of highly anisotropic optical lattices, where the proposed topological phase transitions are most pronounced. To characterize the existence of these topological transitions, we calculate several measurable quantities including momentum distribution, quasi-particle excitation spectrum, atomic compressibility, superfluid density, and sound velocities. 
0808.01427	Determining sets, resolving sets, and the exchange property	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Debra Boutin	Abstract:  A subset U of vertices of a graph G is called a determining set if every automorphism of G is uniquely determined by its action on the vertices of U. A subset W is called a resolving set if every vertex in G is uniquely determined by its distances to the vertices of W. Determining (resolving) sets are said to have the exchange property in G if whenever S and R are minimal determining (resolving) sets for G and r\in R, then there exists s\in S so that S-\{s\}\cup \{r\} is a minimal determining (resolving) set. This work examines graph families in which these sets do, or do not, have the exchange property. This paper shows that neither determining sets nor resolving sets have the exchange property in all graphs, but that both have the exchange property in trees. It also gives an infinite graph family (n-wheels where n\geq 8) in which determining sets have the exchange property but resolving sets do not. Further, this paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for determining sets to have the exchange property in an outerplanar graph. 
0808.01428	The electric dipole moment of the nucleon from simulations at imaginary vacuum angle theta	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:R. Horsley, T. Izubuchi, Y. Nakamura, D. Pleiter, P.E.L. Rakow, G. Schierholz, J. Zanotti	Abstract:  We compute the electric dipole moment of proton and neutron from lattice QCD simulations with N_f=2 flavors of dynamical quarks at imaginary vacuum angle theta. The calculation proceeds via the CP odd form factor F_3. A novel feature of our calculation is that we use partially twisted boundary conditions to extract F_3 at zero momentum transfer. As a byproduct, we test the QCD vacuum at nonvanishing theta. 
0808.01429	Cerny's conjecture, synchronizing automata, group representation theory	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Benjamin Steinberg	Abstract:  Let us say that a Cayley graph $Γ$ of a group $G$ of order $n$ is a Cerny Cayley graph if every synchronizing automaton containing $Γ$ as a subgraph with the same vertex set admits a synchronizing word of length at most $(n-1)^2$. In this paper we use the representation theory of groups over the rational numbers to obtain a number of new infinite families of {Č}ern{ý} Cayley graphs. 
0808.01430	The cyclic sliding operation in Garside groups	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Volker Gebhardt, Juan González-Meneses	Abstract:  We present a new operation to be performed on elements in a Garside group, called cyclic sliding, which is introduced to replace the well known cycling and decycling operations. Cyclic sliding appears to be a more natural choice, simplifying the algorithms concerning conjugacy in Garside groups and having nicer theoretical properties. We show, in particular, that if a super summit element has conjugates which are 'rigid' (that is, which have a certain particularly simple structure), then the optimal way of obtaining such a rigid conjugate through conjugation by positive elements is given by iterated cyclic sliding. 
0808.01431	A General Theory of Computational Scalability Based on Rational Functions	Performance (cs.PF)	Authors:Neil J. Gunther	Abstract:  The universal scalability law of computational capacity is a rational function C_p = P(p)/Q(p) with P(p) a linear polynomial and Q(p) a second-degree polynomial in the number of physical processors p, that has been long used for statistical modeling and prediction of computer system performance. We prove that C_p is equivalent to the synchronous throughput bound for a machine-repairman with state-dependent service rate. Simpler rational functions, such as Amdahl's law and Gustafson speedup, are corollaries of this queue-theoretic bound. C_p is further shown to be both necessary and sufficient for modeling all practical characteristics of computational scalability. 
0808.01432	Derivatives of Knots and Second-order Signatures	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Tim Cochran, Shelly Harvey, Constance Leidy	Abstract:  We define a set of "second-order" L^(2)-signature invariants for any algebraically slice knot. These obstruct a knot's being a slice knot and generalize Casson-Gordon invariants, which we consider to be "first-order signatures". As one application we prove: If K is a genus one slice knot then, on any genus one Seifert surface, there exists a homologically essential simple closed curve of self-linking zero, which has vanishing zero-th order signature and a vanishing first-order signature. This extends theorems of Cooper and Gilmer. We introduce a geometric notion, that of a derivative of a knot with respect to a metabolizer. We also introduce a new equivalence relation, generalizing homology cobordism, called null-bordism. 
0808.01433	Cut-wire-pair structures as two-dimensional magnetic metamaterials	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:David A. Powell, Ilya V. Shadrivov, Yuri S. Kivshar	Abstract:  We study numerically and experimentally magnetic metamaterials based on cut-wire pairs instead of split-ring resonators. The cut-wire pair planar structure is extended in order to create a truly two-dimensional metamaterial suitable for scaling to optical frequencies. We fabricate the cut-wire metamaterial operating at microwave frequencies with lattice spacing around 10% of the free-space wavelength, and find good agreement with direct numerical simulations. Unlike the structures based on split-ring resonators, the nearest-neighbor coupling in cut-wire pairs can result in a magnetic stop-band with propagation in the transverse direction. 
0808.01434	Asymptotic upper bounds on the shades of t-intersecting families	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:James Hirschorn	Abstract:  We examine the m-shades of t-intersecting families of k-subsets of [n], and conjecture on the optimal upper bound on their cardinalities. This conjecture extends Frankl's General Conjecture that was proven true by Ahlswede-Khachatrian. From this we deduce the precise asymptotic upper bounds on the cardinalities of m-shades of t(m)-intersecting families of k(m)-subsets of [2m], as m -> infinity. A generalization to cross-t-intersecting families is also considered. 
0808.01435	A Reflection Principle for Three Vicious Walkers	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:William Y. C. Chen, Donna Q. J. Dou, Terence Y. J. Zhang	Abstract:  We establish a reflection principle for three lattice walkers and use this principle to reduce the enumeration of the configurations of three vicious walkers to that of configurations of two vicious walkers. In the combinatorial treatment of two vicious walkers, we make connections to two-chain watermelons and to the classical ballot problem. Precisely, the reflection principle leads to a bijection between three walks $(L_1, L_2, L_3)$ such that $L_2$ intersects both $L_1$ and $L_3$ and three walks $(L_1, L_2, L_3)$ such that $L_1$ intersects $L_3$. Hence we find a combinatorial interpretation of the formula for the generating function for the number of configurations of three vicious walkers, originally derived by Bousquet-Mélou by using the kernel method, and independently by Gessel by using tableaux and symmetric functions. 
0808.01436	The Asymmetric Superfluid Local Density Approximation (ASLDA)	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Aurel Bulgac, Michael McNeil Forbes	Abstract:  Here we describe the form of the Asymmetric Superfluid Local Density Approximation (ASLDA), a Density Functional Theory (DFT) used to model the two-component unitary Fermi gas. We give the rational behind the functional, and describe explicitly how we determine the form of the DFT from the to the available numerical and experimental data. 
0808.01437	Neutrino nucleus cross sections	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:M. Sajjad Athar, S. Chauhan, S. K. Singh, M. J. Vicente Vacas	Abstract:  We present the results of our calculation which has been performed to study the nuclear effects in the quasielastic, inelastic and deep inelastic scattering of neutrinos(antineutrinos) from nuclear targets. These calculations are done in the local density approximation. We take into account the effect of Pauli blocking, Fermi motion, Coulomb effect, renormalization of weak transition strengths in the nuclear medium in the case of the quasielastic reaction. The inelastic reaction leading to production of pions is calculated in a $Δ$- dominance model taking into account the renormalization of $Δ$ properties in the nuclear medium and the final state interaction effects of the outgoing pions with the residual nucleus. We discuss the nuclear effects in the $F_{3}^{A}(x)$ structure function in the deep inelastic neutrino(antineutrino) reaction using a relativistic framework to describe the nucleon spectral function in the nucleus. 
0808.01438	L-functions for GSp(4)xGL(2)in the case of high GL(2) conductor	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Ameya Pitale, Ralf Schmidt	Abstract:  Furusawa has given an integral representation for the degree 8 L-function of GSp(4) x GL(2) and has carried out the unramified calculation. The local p-adic zeta integrals were calculated in our earlier work under the assumption that the GSp(4) representation πis unramified and the GL(2) representation τ has conductor p. In the present work we generalize to the case where the GL(2) representation has arbitrarily high conductor. The result is that the zeta integral represents the local Euler factor L(s,π\times τ) in all cases. As a global application we obtain a special value result for a GSp(4) x GL(2) global L-function coming from classical holomorphic cusp forms with arbitrarily high level for the elliptic modular form. 
0808.01439	Gas disks to gas giants: Simulating the birth of planetary systems	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Edward W. Thommes, Soko Matsumura, Frederic A. Rasio	Abstract:  The ensemble of now more than 250 discovered planetary systems displays a wide range of masses, orbits and, in multiple systems, dynamical interactions. These represent the end point of a complex sequence of events, wherein an entire protostellar disk converts itself into a small number of planetary bodies. Here, we present self-consistent numerical simulations of this process, which produce results in agreement with some of the key trends observed in the properties of the exoplanets. Analogs to our own solar system do not appear to be common, originating from disks near the boundary between barren and (giant) planet-forming. 
0808.01440	Characterizing the Hofstadter butterfly's outline with Chern numbers	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:N. Goldman	Abstract:  In this work, we report original properties inherent to independent particles subjected to a magnetic field by emphasizing the existence of regular structures in the energy spectrum's outline. We show that this fractal curve, the well-known Hofstadter butterfly's outline, is associated to a specific sequence of Chern numbers that correspond to the quantized transverse conductivity. Indeed the topological invariant that characterizes the fundamental energy band depicts successive stairways as the magnetic flux varies. Moreover each stairway is shown to be labeled by another Chern number which measures the charge transported under displacement of the periodic potential. We put forward the universal character of these properties by comparing the results obtained for the square and the honeycomb geometries. 
0808.01441	Injection of Short-Lived Radionuclides into the Early Solar System from a Faint Supernova with Mixing-Fallback	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Takigawa, J. Miki, S. Tachibana, G. R. Huss, N. Tominaga, H. Umeda, K. Nomoto	Abstract:  Several short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) were present in the early solar system, some of which should have formed just prior to or soon after the solar system formation. Stellar nucleosynthesis has been proposed as the mechanism for production of SLRs in the solar system, but no appropriate stellar source has been found to explain the abundances of all solar system SLRs. In this study, we propose a faint supernova with mixing and fallback as a stellar source of SLRs with mean lives of <5 Myr (26Al, 41Ca, 53Mn, and 60Fe) in the solar system. In such a supernova, the inner region of the exploding star experiences mixing, a small fraction of mixed materials is ejected, and the rest undergoes fallback onto the core. The modeled SLR abundances agree well with their solar system abundances if mixing-fallback occurs within the C/O-burning layer. In some cases, the initial solar system abundances of the SLRs can be reproduced within a factor of 2. The dilution factor of supernova ejecta to the solar system materials is ~10E-4 and the time interval between the supernova explosion and the formation of oldest solid materials in the solar system is ~1 Myr. If the dilution occurred due to spherically symmetric expansion, a faint supernova should have occurred nearby the solar system forming region in a star cluster. 
0808.01442	SO(3)-Donaldson invariants of CP^2 and Mock Theta Functions	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Andreas Malmendier, Ken Ono	Abstract:  We compute the Moore-Witten regularized u-plane integral on CP^2, and we confirm their conjecture that it is the generating function for the SO(3)-Donaldson invariants of CP^2. We prove this conjecture using the theory of mock theta functions and harmonic Maass forms. We also derive further such generating functions for the SO(3)-Donaldson invariants with 2N_f massless monopoles using the geometry of certain rational elliptic surfaces (N_f=0,2,3,4). We show that the partition function for N_f=4 is nearly modular. When combined with one of Ramanujan's mock theta functions, we obtain a weight 1/2 modular form. This fact is central to the proof of the conjecture. 
0808.01443	Links between traumatic brain injury and ballistic pressure waves originating in the thoracic cavity and extremities	Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)	Authors:Amy Courtney, Michael Courtney	Abstract:  Identifying patients at risk of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is important because research suggests prophylactic treatments to reduce risk of long-term sequelae. Blast pressure waves can cause TBI without penetrating wounds or blunt force trauma. Similarly, bullet impacts distant from the brain can produce pressure waves sufficient to cause mild to moderate TBI. The fluid percussion model of TBI shows that pressure impulses of 15-30 psi cause mild to moderate TBI in laboratory animals. In pigs and dogs, bullet impacts to the thigh produce pressure waves in the brain of 18-45 psi and measurable injury to neurons and neuroglia. Analyses of research in goats and epidemiological data from shooting events involving humans show high correlations (r > 0.9) between rapid incapacitation and pressure wave magnitude in the thoracic cavity. A case study has documented epilepsy resulting from a pressure wave without the bullet directly hitting the brain. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that bullet impacts distant from the brain produce pressure waves that travel to the brain and can retain sufficient magnitude to induce brain injury. The link to long-term sequelae could be investigated via epidemiological studies of patients who were gunshot in the chest to determine whether they experience elevated rates of epilepsy and other neurological sequelae. 
0808.01444	Loewner equations, Hirota equations and reductions of universal Whitham hierarchy	Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)	Authors:Kanehisa Takasaki, Takashi Takebe	Abstract:  This paper reconsiders finite variable reductions of the universal Whitham hierarchy of genus zero in the perspective of dispersionless Hirota equations. In the case of one-variable reduction, dispersionless Hirota equations turn out to be a powerful tool for understanding the mechanism of reduction. All relevant equations describing the reduction (Löwner-type equations and diagonal hydrodynamic equations) can be thereby derived and justified in a unified manner. The case of multi-variable reductions is not so straightforward. Nevertheless, the reduction procedure can be formulated in a general form, and justified with the aid of dispersionless Hirota equations. As an application, previous results of Guil, Mañas and Mart\'ınez Alonso are reconfirmed in this formulation. 
0808.01445	Calculation of current-induced torque from spin continuity equation	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Gen Tatara, Peter Entel	Abstract:  Current-induced torque is formulated based on the spin continuity equation. The formulation does not rely on the assumption of separation of local spin and charge degrees of freedom, in contrast to approaches based on the $s$-$d$ model or mean-field approximation of itinerant ferromagnetism. This new method would be thus useful for the estimation of torques in actual materials by first-principles calculations. As an example, the formalism is applied to the adiabatic limit of the $s$-$d$ model in order to obtain the analytical expression for torques and corresponding $β$ terms arising from spin relaxation due to spin-flip scattering and spin-orbit interaction. 
0808.01446	What is the Simplest Quantum Field Theory?	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Nima Arkani-Hamed, Freddy Cachazo, Jared Kaplan	Abstract:  Conventional wisdom says that the simpler the Lagrangian of a theory the simpler its perturbation theory, but an increased understanding of the structure of the S-matrix in gauge theories and gravity has been pointing to the opposite conclusion. In this paper we suggest that N=8 SUGRA has the simplest interacting S-matrix in 4D. Using Grassmann coherent states for external particles shows that amplitudes with maximal SUSY are smooth objects, with the action of SUSY manifest. We show that all tree amplitudes in N=4 SYM and N=8 SUGRA vanish at (supersymmetric) infinite complex momentum, and can thus be determined by recursion relations. We also identify the action of the non-linearly realized E_{7(7)} symmetry of N=8 SUGRA on scattering amplitudes. We give a simple discussion of the structure of 1-loop amplitudes in any QFT, in close parallel to recent work of Forde, showing that the coefficients of scalar "triangle" and "bubble" integrals are determined by the "pole at infinite momentum" of tree amplitude products appearing in cuts. The on-shell superspace for maximal SUSY makes it easy to compute the multiplet sums that arise in these cuts, leading to a simple proof of the absence of triangles and bubbles at 1-loop. We also argue that rational terms are absent. This establishes the recent conjecture that 1-loop amplitudes in N=8 SUGRA have only scalar box integrals, just as N=4 SYM. It is natural to conjecture that with maximal SUSY, amplitudes are completely determined by their leading singularities even beyond tree- and 1-loop level; this would directly imply the perturbative finiteness of N=8 SUGRA. The remarkable properties of scattering amplitudes call for an explanation in terms of a "weak-weak" dual formulation of QFT, a holographic dual of flat space. 
0808.01447	Confinement- Deconfinement Phase Transition in Hot and Dense QCD at Large N	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Ariel R. Zhitnitsky	Abstract:  We conjecture that the confinement- deconfinement phase transition in QCD at large number of colors N and N_f\ll N at T\neq 0 and μ\neq 0 is triggered by the drastic change in θbehavior. The conjecture is motivated by the holographic model of QCD where confinement -deconfinement phase transition indeed happens precisely at the value of temperature T=T_c where θ dependence experiences a sudden change in behavior[1]. The conjecture is also supported by quantum field theory arguments when the instanton calculations (which trigger the θdependence) are under complete theoretical control for T>T_c, suddenly break down immediately below T<T_c with sharp changes in the θdependence. Finally, the conjecture is supported by a number of numerical lattice results. We employ this conjecture to study confinement -deconfinement phase transition of dense QCD at large μin large N limit by analyzing the θdependence. We find that the confinement- deconfinement phase transition at N_f\ll N happens at very large quark chemical potential μ_c\sim \sqrt{N}Λ_{QCD}. This result agrees with recent findings by McLerran and Pisarski[2]. We also speculate on case when N_f\sim N. 
0808.01448	Markov switching models: an application to roadway safety	Applications (stat.AP)	Authors:Nataliya V. Malyshkina	Abstract:  In this research, two-state Markov switching models are proposed to study accident frequencies and severities. These models assume that there are two unobserved states of roadway safety, and that roadway entities (e.g., roadway segments) can switch between these states over time. The states are distinct, in the sense that in the different states accident frequencies or severities are generated by separate processes (e.g., Poisson, negative binomial, multinomial logit). Bayesian inference methods and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations are used for estimation of Markov switching models. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach, we conduct the following three studies. In the first study, two-state Markov switching count data models are considered as an alternative to zero-inflated models for annual accident frequencies, in order to account for preponderance of zeros typically observed in accident frequency data. In the second study, two-state Markov switching Poisson model and two-state Markov switching negative binomial model are estimated using weekly accident frequencies on selected Indiana interstate highway segments over a five-year time period. In the third study, two-state Markov switching multinomial logit models are estimated for severity outcomes of accidents occurring on Indiana roads over a four-year time period. One of the most important results found in each of the three studies, is that in each case the estimated Markov switching models are strongly favored by roadway safety data and result in a superior statistical fit, as compared to the corresponding standard (non-switching) models. 
0808.01449	Pure spin current generation in a Rashba-Dresselhaus quantum channel	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Chia-Hui Lin, Chi-Shung Tang, Yia-Chung Chang	Abstract:  We demonstrate a spin pump to generate pure spin current of tunable intensity and polarization in the absence of charge current. The pumping functionality is achieved by means of an ac gate voltage that modulates the Rashba constant dynamically in a local region of a quantum channel with both static Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. Spin-resolved Floquet scattering matrix is calculated to analyze the whole scattering process. Pumped spin current can be divided into spin-preserved transmission and spin-flip reflection parts. These two terms have opposite polarization of spin current and are competing with each other. Our proposed spin-based device can be utilized for non-magnetic control of spin flow by tuning the ac gate voltage and the driving frequency. 
0808.01450	Hypothesis testing for Gaussian states on bosonic lattices	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Milan Mosonyi	Abstract:  The asymptotic state discrimination problem with simple hypotheses is considered for a cubic lattice of bosons. A complete solution is provided for the problems of the Chernoff and the Hoeffding bounds and Stein's lemma in the case when both hypotheses are gauge-invariant Gaussian states with translation-invariant quasi-free parts. 
0808.01451	The friction factor of two-dimensional rough-boundary turbulent soap film flows	Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)	Authors:Nicholas Guttenberg, Nigel Goldenfeld	Abstract:  We use momentum transfer arguments to predict the friction factor $f$ in two-dimensional turbulent soap-film flows with rough boundaries (an analogue of three-dimensional pipe flow) as a function of Reynolds number Re and roughness $r$, considering separately the inverse energy cascade and the forward enstrophy cascade. At intermediate Re, we predict a Blasius-like friction factor scaling of $f\propto\textrm{Re}^{-1/2}$ in flows dominated by the enstrophy cascade, distinct from the energy cascade scaling of $\textrm{Re}^{-1/4}$. For large Re, $f \sim r$ in the enstrophy-dominated case. We use conformal map techniques to perform direct numerical simulations that are in satisfactory agreement with theory, and exhibit data collapse scaling of roughness-induced criticality, previously shown to arise in the 3D pipe data of Nikuradse. 
0808.01452	Locally adaptive estimation of evolutionary wavelet spectra	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Sébastien Van Bellegem, Rainer von Sachs	Abstract:  We introduce a wavelet-based model of local stationarity. This model enlarges the class of locally stationary wavelet processes and contains processes whose spectral density function may change very suddenly in time. A notion of time-varying wavelet spectrum is uniquely defined as a wavelet-type transform of the autocovariance function with respect to so-called autocorrelation wavelets. This leads to a natural representation of the autocovariance which is localized on scales. We propose a pointwise adaptive estimator of the time-varying spectrum. The behavior of the estimator studied in homogeneous and inhomogeneous regions of the wavelet spectrum. 
0808.01453	Structural and dynamical heterogeneities in two-dimensional melting	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Hayato Shiba, Akira Onuki, Takeaki Araki	Abstract:  Using molecular dynamics simulation, we study structural and dynamical heterogeneities at melting in two-dimensional one-component systems with 36000 particles. Between crystal and liquid we find intermediate hexatic states, where the density fluctuations are enhanced at small wave number k as well as those of the six-fold orientational order parameter. Their structure factors both grow up to the smallest wave number equal to the inverse system length. The intermediate scattering function of the density S(k,t) is found to relax exponentially with decay rate Gamma_k ~ k^z with z~2.6 at small k in the hexatic phase. 
0808.01454	Some Non-Abelian Phase Spaces in Low Dimensions	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Dongping Hou, Chengming Bai	Abstract:  A non-abelian phase space, or a phase space of a Lie algebra is a generalization of the usual (abelian) phase space of a vector space. It corresponds to a parakähler structure in geometry. Its structure can be interpreted in terms of left-symmetric algebras. In particular, a solution of an algebraic equation in a left-symmetric algebra which is an analogue of classical Yang-Baxter equation in a Lie algebra can induce a phase space. In this paper, we find that such phase spaces have a symplectically isomorphic property. We also give all such phase spaces in dimension 4 and some examples in dimension 6. These examples can be a guide for a further development.

0808.01456	Diffuse interstellar bands in RAVE Survey spectra	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:U. Munari, L. Tomasella, M. Fiorucci, O. Bienayme, J. Binney, J. Bland-Hawthorn, C. Boeche R. Campbell, K.C. Freeman, B. Gibson, G. Gilmore, E.K. Grebel, A. Helmi, J.F. Navarro, Q.A. Parker, G.M. Seabroke, A. Siebert, A. Siviero, M. Steinmetz, F.G. Watson, M. Williams, R.F.G. Wyse, T. Zwitter	Abstract:  We have used spectra of hot stars from the RAVE Survey in order to investigate the visibility and properties of five diffuse interstellar bands previously reported in the literature. The RAVE spectroscopic survey for Galactic structure and kinematics records CCD spectra covering the 8400-8800 Ang wavelength region at 7500 resolving power. The spectra are obtained with the UK Schmidt at the AAO, equipped with the 6dF multi-fiber positioner. The DIB at 8620.4 Ang is by far the strongest and cleanest of all DIBs occurring within the RAVE wavelength range, with no interference by underlying absorption stellar lines in hot stars. It correlates so tightly with reddening that it turns out to be a reliable tool to measure it, following the relation E(B-V) = 2.72 (+/- 0.03) x E.W.(Ang), valid throughout the general interstellar medium of our Galaxy. The presence of a DIB at 8648 Ang is confirmed. Its intensity appears unrelated to reddening, in agreement with scanty and preliminary reports available in the literature, and its measurability is strongly compromised by severe blending with underlying stellar HeI doublet at 8649 Ang. The two weak DIBS at 8531 and 8572 Ang do not appear real and should actually be blends of underlying stellar lines. The very weak DIB at 8439 Ang cannot be resolved within the profile of the much stronger underlying hydrogen Paschen 18 stellar line. 
0808.01457	A stochastic differential game for the inhomogeneous $\infty$-Laplace equation	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Rami Atar, Amarjit Budhiraja	Abstract:  Given a bounded $\mathcaligr{C}^2$ domain $G\subset{\mathbb{R}}^m$, functions $g\in\mathcaligr{C}(\partial G,{\mathbb{R}})$ and $h\in\mathcaligr {C}(\bar{G},{\mathbb{R}}\setminus\{0\})$, let $u$ denote the unique viscosity solution to the equation $-2Δ_{\infty}u=h$ in $G$ with boundary data $g$. We provide a representation for $u$ as the value of a two-player zero-sum stochastic differential game. 
0808.01458	Vertex Operator Algebra Analogue of Embedding $D_8$ into $E_8$	Quantum Algebra (math.QA)	Authors:Yan-Jun Chu, Zhu-Jun Zheng	Abstract:  Let $L_{D_8}(1, 0)$ and $L_{E_8}(1, 0)$ be the simple vertex operator algebras associated to untwisted affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathbf g}_{D_{8}}$ and $\widehat{\mathbf g}_{E_8}$ with level 1 respectively. In the 1980s by I. Frenkel, Lepowsky and Meurman as one of the many important preliminary steps toward their construction of the moonshine module vertex operator algebra, they use roots lattice showing that $L_{D_8}(1, 0)$ can embed into $L_{E_8}(1, 0)$ as a vertex operator subalgebra(\cite{5, 6, 8}). Their construct is a base of vertex operator theory. But the embedding they gave using the fact $L_{\mathbf g}(1,0)$ is isomorphic to its root lattice vertex operator algebra $V_L$. In this paper, we give an explicitly construction of the embedding and show that as an $L_{D_8}(1, 0)$-module, $L_{E_8}(1, 0)$ is isomorphic to the extension of $L_{D_8}(1, 0)$ by its simple module $L_{D_8}(1, \overlineω_8)$. It may be convenient to be used for conformal field theory. 
0808.01459	Giant Extrinsic Spin Hall Effect due to Rare-Earth Impurities	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:T. Tanaka, H. Kontani	Abstract:  We investigate the extrinsic spin Hall effect in the electron gas model due to magnetic impurities, by focusing on Ce- and Yb-impurities. In the dilute limit, the skew scattering term dominates the side jump term. For Ce-impurities, the spin Hall angle $α_{\rm SH}$ due to skew scattering is given by $-8π\sinδ_2/7$, where $δ_2 (\ll 1)$ is the phase shift for$d (l=2)$ partial wave. Since $α_{\rm SH}$ reaches $O(10^{-1})$ if $δ_2 \simge 0.03$, the spin Hall effect is anticipated to be considerable in metals with rare-earth impurities. The giant extrinsic SHE originates from the large orbital angular momentum, which is also significant for the intrinsic SHE. 
0808.01460	Simple derivation of Young, Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter equations and its interpretations	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:S. Banerjee	Abstract:  In this paper we have derived Young's, Wenzel's and Cassie-Baxter's equations using conceptual model rather than showing rigorous derivation to help the new-comers in this field. We then pointed out that if the substrate is initially hydorphilic then one can modify the surface morphology and make the substrate to become hydrophobic or superhydrophobic. But, if the substrate is initially hydrophobic then one can only make it superhydrophobic but not hydrophilic by modifying the surface morphology using the formalisms mentioned in this paper 
0808.01461	Influence of primordial magnetic fields on 21 cm emission	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Dominik R. G. Schleicher, Robi Banerjee, Ralf S. Klessen	Abstract:  Magnetic fields in the early universe can significantly alter the thermal evolution and the ionization history during the dark ages. This is reflected in the 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen, which is coupled to the gas temperature through collisions at high redshifts, and through the Wouthuysen-Field effect at low redshifts. We present a semi-analytic model for star formation and the build-up of a Lyman alpha background in the presence of magnetic fields, and calculate the evolution of the mean 21 cm brightness temperature and its frequency gradient as a function of redshift. We further discuss the evolution of linear fluctuations in temperature and ionization in the presence of magnetic fields and calculate the effect on the 21 cm power spectrum. At high redshifts, the signal is increased compared to the non-magnetic case due to the additional heat input into the IGM from ambipolar diffusion and the decay of MHD turbulence. At lower redshifts, the formation of luminous objects and the build-up of a Lyman alpha background can be delayed by a redshift interval of 10 due to the strong increase of the filtering mass scale in the presence of magnetic fields. This tends to decrease the 21 cm signal compared to the zero-field case. In summary, we find that 21 cm observations may become a promising tool to constrain primordial magnetic fields. 
0808.01462	The X boson (MX ~ 1014 GeV) mediation of the HI relativistic reactions generated by RHIC and LHC	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:M Kozlowski	Abstract:  In this paper the model for the p-p accretion process in HI reactions is described. The mediation by X boson (MX ~ 1014 GeV) is outlined. The Heaviside equation for the thermal processes in HI scattering is obtained and solved.

0808.01463	A family of Koszul algebras arising from finite-dimensional representations of simple Lie algebras	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Vyjayanthi Chari, Jacob Greenstein	Abstract:  Let $\lie g$ be a simple Lie algebra and let $\bs^{\lie g}$ be the locally finite part of the algebra of invariants $(_\bc\bv\otimes S(\lie g))^{\lie g}$ where $\bv$ is the direct sum of all simple finite-dimensional modules for $\lie g$ and $S(\lie g)$ is the symmetric algebra of $\lie g$. Given an integral weight $ξ$, let $Ψ=Ψ(ξ)$ be the subset of roots which have maximal scalar product with $ξ$. Given a dominant integral weight $λ$ and $ξ$ such that $Ψ$ is a subset of the positive roots we construct a finite-dimensional subalgebra $\bs^{\lie g}_Ψ(\le_Ψλ)$ of $\bs^{\lie g}$ and prove that the algebra is Koszul of global dimension at most the cardinality of $Ψ$. Using this we then construct naturally an infinite-dimensional Koszul algebra of global dimension equal to the cardinality of $Ψ$. The results and the methods are motivated by the study of the category of finite-dimensional representations of the affine and quantum affine algebras. 
0808.01464	Achieving High Curie Temperature in (Ga,Mn)As	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:M Wang, R P Campion, A W Rushforth, K W Edmonds, C T Foxon, B L Gallagher	Abstract:  We study the effects of growth temperature, Ga:As ratio and post-growth annealing procedure on the Curie temperature, Tc, of (Ga,Mn)As layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy. We achieve the highest Tc values for growth temperatures very close to the 2D-3D phase boundary. The increase in Tc, due to the removal of interstitial Mn by post growth annealing, is counteracted by a second process which reduces Tc and which is more effective at higher annealing temperatures. Our results show that it is necessary to optimize the growth parameters and post growth annealing procedure to obtain the highest Tc. 
0808.01465	A low background facility inside the LVD detector at Gran Sasso	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:F. Arneodo, W. Fulgione	Abstract:  The Large Volume Detector (LVD) in the Gran Sasso Laboratory of INFN is an observatory mainly devoted to search for neutrinos from core collapse supernovae. It consists of 1000 tons of liquid scintillator divided in 840 stainless steel tanks 1.5m$^3$ each. In this letter we present the possibility for LVD to work both as a passive shield and moderator for the low energy gamma and neutron background and as an active veto for muons and higher energy neutrons. An inner region inside the LVD structure ("LVD Core Facility") can be identified, with a volume of about 30m$^3$, with the neutron background typical of an underground laboratory placed at a much deeper site. This region can be realized with a negligible impact on the LVD operation and sensitive mass. The LVD Core Facility could be effectively exploited by a compact experiment for the search of rare events, such as double beta decay or dark matter. 
0808.01466	Strong Off-Resonant Enhancement of Spontaneous Emission in Metal-Dielectric-Metal Plasmon Waveguide Structures	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Y.C. Jun, R.D. Kekapture, J.S. White, M.L. Brongersma	Abstract:  We theoretically investigate the spontaneous emission process of an optical, dipolar emitter in metal-dielectric-metal slab and slot waveguide structures. We find that both structures exhibit strong off-resonant emission enhancements due to the tight confinement of modes between two metallic plates. The large enhancement of surface plasmon-polariton excitation enables dipole emission to be preferentially coupled into plasmon waveguide modes. These structures find applications in creating nanoscale local light sources or in generating guided single plasmons in integrated optical circuits. 
0808.01467	Tight--binding description of the quasiparticle dispersion of graphite and few--layer graphene	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:A. Grüneis, C. Attaccalite, L. Wirtz, H. Shiozawa R. Saito, T. Pichler, A. Rubio	Abstract:  A universal set of third--nearest neighbour tight--binding (TB) parameters is presented for calculation of the quasiparticle (QP) dispersion of $N$ stacked $sp^2$ graphene layers ($N=1... \infty$) with $AB$ stacking sequence. The QP bands are strongly renormalized by electron--electron interactions which results in a 20% increase of the nearest neighbour in--plane and out--of--plane TB parameters when compared to band structure from density functional theory. With the new set of TB parameters we determine the Fermi surface and evaluate exciton energies, charge carrier plasmon frequencies and the conductivities which are relevant for recent angle--resolved photoemission, optical, electron energy loss and transport measurements. A comparision of these quantitities to experiments yields an excellent agreement. Furthermore we discuss the transition from few layer graphene to graphite and a semimetal to metal transition in a TB framework. 
0808.01468	Monitoring of band gap and magnetic state of graphene nanoribbons through vacancies	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:M. Topsakal, E. Akturk, H. Sevincli, S. Ciraci	Abstract:  Using first-principles plane wave calculations we predict that electronic and magnetic properties of graphene nanoribbons can be affected by defect-induced itinerant states. The band gaps of armchair nanoribbons can be modified by hydrogen saturated holes. Defects due to periodically repeating vacancy or divacancies induce metallization, as well as magnetization in non-magnetic semiconducting nanoribbons due to the spin-polarization of local defect states. Antiferromagnetic ground state of semiconducting zigzag ribbons can change to ferrimagnetic state upon creation of vacancy defects, which reconstruct and interact with edge states. Even more remarkable is that all these effects of vacancy defects are found to depend on their geometry and position relative to edges. It is shown that these effects can, in fact, be realized without really creating defects. 
0808.01469	A First-Principles Constitutive Equation for Suspension Rheology	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:J.M.Brader, M.E.Cates, M.Fuchs	Abstract:  Using mode-coupling theory, we derive a constitutive equation for the nonlinear rheology of dense colloidal suspensions under arbitrary time-dependent homogeneous flow. Generalizing previous results for simple shear, this allows the full tensorial structure of the theory to be identified. Macroscopic deformation measures, such as the Cauchy-Green tensors, thereby emerge. So does a direct relation between the stress and the distorted microstructure, illuminating the interplay of slow structural relaxation and arbitrary imposed flow. We present flow curves for steady planar and uniaxial elongation and compare these to simple shear. The resulting non-linear Trouton ratios point to a tensorially nontrivial dynamic yield condition for colloidal glasses. 
0808.01470	Encompression Using Two-dimensional Cellular Automata Rules	Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)	Authors:Sudhakar Sahoo, Sanjaya Sahoo, Birendra Kumar Nayak, Pabitra Pal Choudhury	Abstract:  In this paper, we analyze the algebraic structure of some null boundary as well as some periodic boundary 2-D Cellular Automata (CA) rules by introducing a new matrix multiplication operation using only AND, OR instead of most commonly used AND, EX-OR. This class includes any CA whose rule, when written as an algebra, is a finite Abelean cyclic group in case of periodic boundary and a finite commutative cyclic monoid in case of null boundary CA respectively. The concept of 1-D Multiple Attractor Cellular Automata (MACA) is extended to 2-D. Using the family of 2-D MACA and the finite Abelian cyclic group, an efficient encompression algorithm is proposed for binary images. 
0808.01471	The complex galaxy cluster Abell 514: New results obtained with the XMM - Newton satellite	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. Weratschnig (1), M. Gitti (2), S. Schindler (1), K. Dolag (3) ((1) Institute of Astro- and Particle Physics University of Innsbruck, (2) INAF - Osservatorio Astronomico di Bologna, (3) Max-Planck-Institut f\"ur Astrophysik Garching)    	Abstract:  We study the X-ray morphology and dynamics of the galaxy cluster Abell 514. Also, the relation between the X-ray properties and Faraday Rotation measures of this cluster are investigated in order to study the connection of magnetic fields and the intra-cluster medium. We use two combined XMM - Newton pointings that are split into three distinct observations. The data allow us to evaluate the overall cluster properties like temperature and metallicity with high accuracy. Additionally, a temperature map and the metallicity distribution are computed, which are used to study the dynamical state of the cluster in detail. Abell 514 represents an interesting merger cluster with many substructures visible in the X-ray image and in the temperature and abundance distributions. The new XMM - Newton data of Abell 514 confirm the relation between the X-ray brightness and the sigma of the Rotation Measure (S_X - sigma_RM relation) proposed by Dolag et al. (2001).

The complementary group of proper motions of the metric in a class of noninertial reference system has been found.

The OR-predictions are found in a good agreement with the actual experimental data in the region corresponding to the Delta(1236) resonance in elementary pi-N scattering. The essential signatures of the optimal resonances are experimentally verified with high accuracy. 
0808.01475	Experimental and Theoretical Investigation of the Barrier Pyroelectric Effect in a Quantum Paraelectric Semiconductor	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:A. V. Butenko (1), V. Sandomirsky (1), R. Kahatabi (1), Z. Dashevsky (2), V. Kasiyan (2), Z. Zalevsky (2), Y. Schlesinger (1) ((1)Department of Physics, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel, (2)Materials Engineering Department, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel, (3)School of Engineering, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel)    	Abstract:  We describe here the first comprehensive investigation of a pyroelectric response of a p-n junction in a non-polar paraelectric semiconductor. The pyroelectric effect is generated by the, temperature dependent, built-in electrical dipole moment. High quality PbTe p-n junctions have been prepared specifically for this experiment. The pyroelectric effect was excited by a continuous CO2 laser beam, modulated by a mechanical chopper. The shape and amplitude of the periodic and single-pulse pyroelectric signals were studied as a function of temperature (10K-130K), reverse bias voltage (up to -500 mV) and chopping frequency (4Hz-2000Hz). The pyroelectric coefficient is about 10^(-3) microC/cm2K in the temperature region 40 - 80 K. The developed theoretical model quantitatively describes all the experimental features of the observed pyroelectric effect. The time evolution of the temperature within the p-n junction was reconstructed.

The method avoids long calculations and yields the expected polynomial growth in the $s$-parameter for the remaining term. 
0808.01477	Looking for Groebner Basis Theory for (Almost) Skew 2-Nomial Algebras	Rings and Algebras (math.RA)	Authors:Huishi Li	Abstract:  In this paper, we introduce (almost) skew 2-nomial algebras and look for a one-sided or two-sided Gröbner basis theory for such algebras at a modest level. That is, we establish the existence of a skew multiplicative $K$-basis for every skew 2-nomial algebra, and we explore the existence of a (left, right, or two-sided) monomial ordering for an (almost) skew 2-nomial algebra. As distinct from commonly recognized algebras holding a Gröbner basis theory (such as algebras of the solvable type [K-RW] and some of their homomorphic images), a subclass of skew 2-nomial algebras that have a left Gröbner basis theory but may not necessarily have a two-sided Gröbner basis theory, respectively a subclass of skew 2-nomial algebras that have a right Gröbner basis theory but may not necessarily have a two-sided Gröbner basis theory, are determined such that numerous quantum binomial algebras (which provide binomial solutions to the Yang-baxter equation [Laf], [G-I2]) are involved. 
0808.01478	XY model on the circle: diagonalization, spectrum, and forerunners of the quantum phase transition	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:A. De Pasquale, P. Facchi	Abstract:  We exactly diagonalize the finite-size XY model with periodic boundary conditions and analytically determine the ground state energy. We show that there are two types of fermions: singles and pairs, whose dispersion relations have a completely arbitrary gauge-dependent sign. It follows that the ground state is determined by a competition between the vacuum states (with a suitable gauge) of two parity sectors. We finally exhibit some points in finite size systems that forerun criticality. They are associated to single Bogoliubov fermions and to the level crossings between physical and unphysical states. In the thermodynamic limit they approach the ground state and build up singularities at logarithmic rates. 
0808.01479	Non-linear graphene optics for terahertz applications	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:S. A. Mikhailov	Abstract:  The linear electrodynamic properties of graphene -- the frequency-dependent conductivity, the transmission spectra and collective excitations -- are briefly outlined. The non-linear frequency multiplication effects in graphene are studied, taking into account the influence of the self-consistent-field effects and of the magnetic field. The predicted phenomena can be used for creation of new devices for microwave and terahertz optics and electronics.

0808.01481	Optical spectroscopy of 3CR sample of radio sources at z<0.3	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Sara Buttiglione (1), Alessandro Capetti (2), Annalisa Celotti (1) ((1) SISSA/International School for Advanced Studies, Trieste, Italy (2) INAF - Osservatorio Astronomico di Torino, Italy)    	Abstract:  We are carrying out a program of optical spectroscopy of the complete subsample of the 3CR catalog of radio sources at redshift z < 0.3. The sample consists of 113 3CR sources, comprising FR I, FR II radio galaxies and Quasars. Complete datasets in other bands are already or will be soon available for the whole sample but the optical spectra are sparse and inhomogeneous in quality. The observations are carried out at the 3.58m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG, La Palma). More than 100 sources have been already observed. We present here the preliminary results on the analysis of the high and low resolution spectra. We found that sources can be spectroscopically characterized as: High Excitation Galaxies (HEG), Low Excitation Galaxies (LEG) and "Relic" AGNs. This classification is supported by the optical - radio correlations in which objects spectroscopically different follow different correlations. We conclude that AGNs with the same radio power can be fueled with different accretion properties. "Relic" radio-galaxies are characterized by extreme low excitation spectra that we interpret as nuclei whose activity has recently turned-off. The full spectral catalog will be made available to the scientific community. 
0808.01482	On hyperbolic cohomology classes	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:M. Brunnbauer, D. Kotschick	Abstract:  We study hyperbolic cohomology classes in the general context of simplicial complexes and prove homological invariance statements for them. We relate the existence of hyperbolic cohomology classes to the non-amenability of the fundamental group. In degree two we clarify the relation between hyperbolic and atoroidal classes, leading to an application to symplectically atoroidal manifolds. 
0808.01483	Graded annihilators and tight closure test ideals	Commutative Algebra (math.AC)	Authors:Rodney Y. Sharp	Abstract:  Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian local ring of prime characteristic $p$. The main purposes of this paper are to show that if the injective envelope $E$ of the simple $R$-module has a structure as a torsion-free left module over the Frobenius skew polynomial ring over $R$, then $R$ has a tight closure test element (for modules) and is $F$-pure, and to relate the test ideal of $R$ to the smallest '$E$-special' ideal of $R$ of positive height. A byproduct is an analogue of a result of Janet Cowden Vassilev: she showed, in the case where $R$ is an $F$-pure homomorphic image of an $F$-finite regular local ring, that there exists a strictly ascending chain $0 = τ_0 \subset τ_1 \subset ... \subset τ_t = R$ of radical ideals of $R$ such that, for each $i = 0, ..., t-1$, the reduced local ring $R/τ_i$ is $F$-pure and its test ideal (has positive height and) is exactly $τ_{i+1}/τ_i$. This paper presents an analogous result in the case where $R$ is complete (but not necessarily $F$-finite) and $E$ has a structure as a torsion-free left module over the Frobenius skew polynomial ring. Whereas Cowden Vassilev's results were based on R. Fedder's criterion for $F$-purity, the arguments in this paper are based on the author's work on graded annihilators of left modules over the Frobenius skew polynomial ring. 
0808.01484	Dynamics of Polymer Decompression: Expansion, Unfolding and Ejection	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Takahiro Sakaue, Natsuhiko Yoshinaga	Abstract:  The dynamics of polymer decompression, i.e., a process from compressed, compact state to the relaxed swoll en conformation, can be formally described as a {\it nonlinear diffusion}. We discuss here two basic examples: (i) the expansion, or unfolding from a compact state, and (ii) the ejection of pressed polymer through a pore. The problem can be solved exactly for the case (i), but not for the latter. Even in such situations, a scheme called {\it uniform approximation} is shown to be useful to get a physical insight involved. Its application to the case (ii) is able to account for conflicting numerical data in a consistent way. 
0808.01485	Structure of bottle-brush polymers in solution: A Monte Carlo test of models for the scattering function	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Hsiao-Ping Hsu, Wolfgang Paul, Kurt Binder	Abstract:  Extensive Monte Carlo results are presented for a lattice model of a bottle-brush polymer under good solvent or Theta solvent conditions. Varying the side chain length, backbone length, and the grafting density for a rigid straight backbone, both radial density profiles of monomers and side chain ends are obtained, as well as structure factors describing the scattering from a single side chain and from the total bottle-brush polymer. To describe the structure in the interior of a very long bottle-brush, a periodic boundary condition in the direction along the backbone is used, and to describe effects due to the finiteness of the backbone length, a second set of simulations with free ends of the backbone is performed. In the latter case, the inhomogeneity of the structure in the direction along the backbone is carefully investigated. We use these results to test various phenomenological models that have been proposed to interpret experimental scattering data for bottle-brush macromolecules. These models aim to extract information on the radial density profile of a bottle-brush from the total scattering via suitable convolution approximations. Possibilities to improve such models, guided by our simulation results, are discussed.

Yazynin	Abstract:  Influence of volume capture on a process of volume reflection of ultrarelativistic particles moving in bent single crystals was considered analytically. Relations describing various distributions of particles involving in the process, the probability of volume capture and behavior of channeling and dechanneling fractions of a beam were obtained. Results of study will be useful at creation of multicrystal devices for collimation and extraction of beams on modern and future accelerators. 
0808.01487	Observation of B0 -> chi_c0K*0 and evidence for B+ -> chi_c0K*+	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We present the observation of the decay B0 -> chi_c0K*0 as well as evidence of B+ -> chi_c0K*+, with an 8.9 and a 3.6 standard deviation significance, respectively, using a data sample of 454 million Y(4S) -> BB decays collected with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II B meson factory located at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The measured branching fractions are: B(B0 -> chi_c0K*0) = (1.7 +/- 0.3 +/- 0.2) * 10^{-4} and B(B+ -> chi_c0K^*+) = (1.4 +/- 0.5 +/- 0.2) * 10^{-4}, where the first quoted errors are statistical and the second are systematic. We obtain a branching fraction upper limit of B(B+ -> chi_c0K*+) < 2.1 * 10^{-4} at the 90% confidence level. 
0808.01488	Escape transition of a polymer chain from a nanotube: how to avoid spurious results by use of the force-biased pruned-enriched Rosenbluth algorithm	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Hsiao-Ping Hsu, Kurt Binder, Leonid I. Klushin, Alexander M. Skvortsov	Abstract:  A polymer chain containing $N$ monomers confined in a finite cylindrical tube of diameter $D$ grafted at a distance $L$ from the open end of the tube may undergo a rather abrupt transition, where part of the chain escapes from the tube to form a "crown-like" coil outside of the tube. When this problem is studied by Monte Carlo simulation of self-avoiding walks on the simple cubic lattice applying a cylindrical confinement and using the standard pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM), one obtains spurious results, however: with increasing chain length the transition gets weaker and weaker, due to insufficient sampling of the "escaped" states, as a detailed analysis shows. In order to solve this problem, a new variant of a biased sequential sampling algorithm with re-sampling is proposed, force-biased PERM: the difficulty of sampling both phases in the region of the first order transition with the correct weights is treated by applying a force at the free end pulling it out of the tube. Different strengths of this force need to be used and reweighting techniques are applied. Using rather long chains (up to N=18000) and wide tubes (up to D=29 lattice spacings), the free energy of the chain, its end-to-end distance, the number of "imprisoned" monomers can be estimated, as well as the order parameter and its distribution. It is suggested that this new algorithm should be useful for other problems involving state changes of polymers, where the different states belong to rather disjunct "valleys" in the phase space of the system. 
0808.01489	Effect of frequency and temperature on microwave-induced magnetoresistance oscillations in two-dimensional electron systems	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Jesus Inarrea	Abstract:  Experimental results on microwave-induced magnetoresistance oscillation in two-dimensional electron systems show a similar behavior of these systems regarding temperature and microwave frequency. It is found that these oscillations tend to quench when frequency or temperature increase, approaching magnetoresistance to the response of the dark system. In this work we show that this experimental behavior can be addressed on the same theoretical basis. Microwave radiation forces the electron orbits to move back and forth being damped by interaction with the lattice. We show that this damping depends dramatically on microwave frequency and also on temperature. An increase in frequency or temperature gives rise to an increase in the lattice damping producing eventually a quenching effect in the magnetoresistance oscillations. 
0808.01490	Symmetries and exact solutions of the rotating shallow water equations	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Alexander Chesnokov	Abstract:  Lie symmetry analysis is applied to study the nonlinear rotating shallow water equations. The 9-dimensional Lie algebra of point symmetries admitted by the model is found. It is shown that the rotating shallow water equations are related with the classical shallow water model with the change of variables. The derived symmetries are used to generate new exact solutions of the rotating shallow equations. In particular, a new class of time-periodic solutions with quasi-closed particle trajectories is constructed and studied. The symmetry reduction method is also used to obtain some invariant solutions of the model. Examples of these solutions are presented with a brief physical interpretation. 
0808.01491	The three-flavor chiral phase structure in hot and dense QCD matter	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Bernd-Jochen Schaefer, Mathias Wagner	Abstract:  Chiral symmetry restoration at nonzero temperature and quark densities are investigated in the framework of a linear sigma model with N_f=3 light quark flavors. After the derivation of the grand potential in mean-field approximation, the nonstrange and strange condensates, the in-medium masses of the scalar and pseudoscalar nonets are analyzed in hot and dense medium. The influence of the axial anomaly on the nonet masses and the isoscalar mixings on the pseudoscalar η-η' and scalar σ(600)-f_0(1370) complex are examined. The sensitivity of the chiral phase transition as well as the existence and location of a critical end point in the phase diagram on the value of the sigma mass is explored. The chiral critical surface with and without the influence of the axial U(1)_A anomaly is elaborated as a function of the pion and kaon masses for several values of the sigma mass. 
0808.01492	Giant fluctuations and gate control of the g-factor in InAs Nanowire Quantum Dots	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:S. Csonka, L. Hofstetter, F. Freitag, S. Oberholzer, T. S. Jespersen, M. Aagesen, J. Nygard, C. Schonenberger	Abstract:  We study the g-factor of discrete electron states in InAs nanowire based quantum dots. The g values are determined from the magnetic field splitting of the zero bias anomaly due to the spin 1/2-Kondo effect. Unlike to previous studies based on 2DEG quantum dots, the g-factors of neighboring electron states show a surprisingly large fluctuation: g can scatter between 2 and 18. Furthermore electric gate tunability of the g-factor is demonstrated. 
0808.01493	On Jordan type inequalities for hyperbolic functions	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:R. Klen, M. Visuri, M.

In particular, lower and upper bounds for functions such as (sin x)/x and x/(sinh x) are proved. 
0808.01494	Non-trivial length dependence of the conductance and negative differential resistance in atomic molecular wires	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:V. M. García-Suárez, C. J. Lambert	Abstract:  We study the electronic and transport properties of two novel molecular wires made of atomic chains of carbon atoms (polyynes) capped with either, benzene-thiols or pyridines. While both molecules are structurally similar, the electrical conductance of benzene-thiol-capped chains attached to gold electrodes is found to be much higher than that of pyridine-capped chains. We predict that the conductance is almost independent of molecular length, which suggests that these molecules could be ideal molecular wires for sub-10 nm circuitry. Both systems exhibit negative differential resistance (NDR) but its origin and characteristics depend on the type of molecule. We find a novel type of NDR mechanism produced by the movement of the LUMO resonance with bias. We also show that by gating the pyridine-capped molecules it is possible to make the NDR disappear and dramatically modify the $I$-$V$ characteristics and the length dependence. 
0808.01495	The finite harmonic oscillator and its applications to sequences, communication and radar	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Shamgar Gurevich, Ronny Hadani, Nir Sochen	Abstract:  A novel system, called the oscillator system, consisting of order of p^3 functions (signals) on the finite field F_p; with p an odd prime, is described and studied. The new functions are proved to satisfy good auto-correlation, cross-correlation and low peak-to-average power ratio properties. Moreover, the oscillator system is closed under the operation of discrete Fourier transform. Applications of the oscillator system for discrete radar and digital communication theory are explained. Finally, an explicit algorithm to construct the oscillator system is presented. 
0808.01496	Gluing Feynman diagrams in NDIM: Insights into the three-point vertex	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:A. T. Suzuki, J. D. Bolzan, A. G. M. Schmidt	Abstract:  Three-point vertex diagram plays a key role in the whole renormalization program of several QFT (quantum field theory) models such as QED, QCD, the Standard Model of eletroweak interactions and so forth. The exact analytic result for the triangle diagram therefore is fundamental. In this work we calculate in two different ways a two-point two-loop massless Feynman diagram using what we call a "gluing" technique in the context of NDIM (Negative Dimensional Integration Method). The two-loop diagram in question can be "glued" in two different ways and we show that both yield the same result and reproduce the one calculated via NDIM for the complete diagram, which, of course, is equivalent to the exact solution obtained by normal positive dimensional calculation. Furthermore, in the process we conclude that the usual massless off-shell triangle diagram result does not hold anymore and present a new solution for it with only three hypergeometric functions $F_{4}$. 
0808.01497	Boundary states and edge currents for free fermions	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Marianne Leitner, Werner Nahm	Abstract:  We calculate the ground state current densities for 2+1 dimensional free fermion theories with local, translationally invariant boundary states. Deformations of the bulk wave functions close to the edge and boundary states both may cause edge current divergencies, which have to cancel in realistic systems. This yields restrictions on the parameters of quantum field theories which can arise as low energy limits of solid state systems. Some degree of Lorentz invariance for boosts parallel to the boundary can be recovered, when the cutoff is removed. 
0808.01498	Elliptic Cylindrical Invisibility Cloak, a Semianalytical Approach Using Mathieu Functions	Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)	Authors:E. Cojocaru	Abstract:  An elliptic cylindrical wave expansion method by using Mathieu functions is developed to obtain the scattering field for a two-dimensional elliptic cylindrical invisibility cloak. The cloak material parameters are obtained from the spatial transformation approach. A near-ideal model of the invisibility cloak is set up to solve the boundary problem at the inner boundary in the cloak shell. The proposed design provides a more practical cloak geometry when compared to previous designs of elliptic cylindrical cloaks. 
0808.01499	Two new Intermediate Polars with a soft X-ray component	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:G. Anzolin, D. de Martino, J.-M. Bonnet-Bidaud, M. Mouchet, B. T. Gaensicke, G. Matt, K. Mukai	Abstract:  We analyze the first X-ray observations with XMM-Newton of RXS J070407.9+262501 and 1RXS 180340.0+401214, in order to characterize their broad-band temporal and spectral properties, also in the UV/optical domain, and to confirm them as Intermediate Polars. For both objects, we performed a timing analysis of the X-ray and UV/optical light curves to detect the white dwarf spin pulsations and study their energy dependence. For 1RXS 180340.0+401214 we also analyzed optical spectroscopic data to determine the orbital period. X-ray spectra were analyzed in the 0.2-10.0 keV range to characterize the emission properties of both sources. We find that the X-ray light curves of both systems are energy dependent and are dominated, below 3-5 keV, by strong pulsations at the white dwarf rotational periods (480 s for 1RXS J070407.9+262501 and 1520.5 s for 1RXS 180340.0+401214). In 1RXS 180340.0+401214 we also detect an X-ray beat variability at 1697 s which, together with our new optical spectroscopy, favours an orbital period of 4.4 hr that is longer than previously estimated. Both systems show complex spectra with a hard (up to 40 keV) optically thin and a soft (85-100 eV) optically thick components heavily absorbed by material partially covering the X-ray sources. Our observations confirm the two systems as Intermediate Polars and also add them as new members of the growing group of 'soft' systems which show the presence of a soft X-ray blackbody component. Differences in the temperatures of the blackbodies are qualitatively explained in terms of reprocessing over different sizes of the white dwarf spot. We suggest that systems showing cooler soft X-ray blackbody components also possess white dwarfs irradiated by cyclotron radiation. 
0808.01500	Cerenkov radiation of spinning particle	Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)	Authors:I.B. Khriplovich	Abstract:  The Cerenkov radiation of a neutral particle with magnetic moment is considered, as well as the spin-dependent contribution to the Cerenkov radiation of a charged spinning particle. The corresponding radiation intensity is obtained for an arbitrary value of spin and for an arbitrary spin orientation with respect to velocity. 
0808.01501	Genuine phase diffusion of a Bose-Einstein condensate in the microcanonical ensemble: A classical field study	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Alice Sinatra (LKB - Lhomond), Yvan Castin (LKB - Lhomond)    	Abstract:  Within the classical field model, we find that the phase of a Bose-Einstein condensate undergoes a true diffusive motion in the microcanonical ensemble, the variance of the condensate phase change between time zero and time $t$ growing linearly in $t$. The phase diffusion coefficient obeys a simple scaling law in the double thermodynamic and Bogoliubov limit. We construct an approximate calculation of the diffusion coefficient, in fair agreement with the numerical results over the considered temperature range, and we extend this approximate calculation to the quantum field. 
0808.01502	Circular Law Theorem for Random Markov Matrices	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Charles Bordenave (IMT), Pietro Caputo, Djalil Chafai (LAMA)    	Abstract:  Consider an nxn random matrix X with i.i.d. nonnegative entries with bounded density, mean m, and finite positive variance sigma^2. Let M be the nxn random Markov matrix with i.i.d. rows obtained from X by dividing each row of X by its sum. In particular, when X11 follows an exponential law, then M belongs to the Dirichlet Markov Ensemble of random stochastic matrices. Our main result states that with probability one, the counting probability measure of the complex spectrum of n^(1/2)M converges weakly as n tends to infinity to the uniform law on the centered disk of radius sigma/m. The bounded density assumption is purely technical and comes from the way we control the operator norm of the resolvent. 
0808.01503	Significance of a combined approach for replacement stones in the heritage buildings' conservation frame	Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)	Authors:Olivier Rozenbaum (ISTO), Luc Barbanson (ISTO), Fabrice Muller (ISTO), Ary Bruand (ISTO)    	Abstract:  Stone substitution is a conventional operation during heritage buildings' restoration, but becomes problematic for architects and restorers when the quarry is mined out. The compatibility of the substitution stones with the original ones has been for long mainly based on the aesthetical aspect, this resulting too often in a patchwork of original and substitution stones with different patina after several years because of differences of properties. In this study, the objective is to show how substitution stones can be selected by combining aesthetic criteria and stones properties that are relevant for analyzing their compatibility. A couple of French limestones with their potential substitution stones were selected for the study. Our results showed that potential substitution stones selected on their aesthetic criteria require to be rejected because of their differences of physical properties. On the other hand, our results showed also the possibility to select substitution stones with satisfactory aesthetic aspect and properties that enable to expect a satisfactory compatibility with the original stone. 
0808.01504	Open and hidden charm in proton-nucleus and heavy-ion collisions	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:O. Linnyk, E.L. Bratkovskaya (FIAS, U. Frankfurt), W. Cassing (U. Giessen)    	Abstract:  We review the collectivity and the suppression pattern of charmed mesons - produced in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at SPS (158 AGeV) and RHIC energies (21 ATeV) - in comparison to dynamical and thermal models. In particular, we examine the charmonium `melting' and the `comover dissociation' scenarios - implemented in a microscopic transport approach - in comparison to the available data from the SPS and RHIC. The analysis shows that the dynamics of c, c-bar quarks at RHIC are dominated by partonic or `pre-hadronic' interactions in the strongly coupled plasma stage. Both the `charmonium melting' and the hadronic `comover absorption and recreation model' are found, however, to be compatible with the experimental observation at SPS energies; the experimental ratio of Psi'/J/Psi versus centrality clearly favors the `hadronic comover' scenario. We find that the collective flow of charm in the purely hadronic Hadron-String Dynamics (HSD) transport appears compatible with the data at SPS energies, but substantially underestimates the data at top RHIC energies. Thus, the large elliptic flow v2 of D-mesons and the low R_AA(p_T) of J/Psi seen experimentally have to be attributed to early interactions of non-hadronic degrees of freedom. Simultaneously, we observe that non-hadronic interactions are mandatory in order to describe the narrowing of the J/Psi rapidity distribution from pp to central Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy. We demonstrate additionally that the strong quenching of low-pT J/Psi's in central Au+Au collisions indicates that a large fraction of final J/Psi mesons is created by a coalescence mechanism close to the phase boundary. Throughout this review we, furthermore, provide predictions for charm observables from Au+Au collisions at FAIR energies of 25-35 AGeV. 
0808.01505	An Almost-Surely Terminating Polynomial Protocol for Asynchronous Byzantine Agreement with Optimal Resilience	Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)	Authors:Ittai Abraham, Danny Dolev, Joseph Y. Halpern	Abstract:  Consider an asynchronous system with private channels and $n$ processes, up to $t$ of which may be faulty. We settle a longstanding open question by providing a Byzantine agreement protocol that simultaneously achieves three properties: 1. (optimal) resilience: it works as long as $n>3t$ 2. (almost-sure) termination: with probability one, all nonfaulty processes terminate 3. (polynomial) efficiency: the expected computation time, memory consumption, message size, and number of messages sent are all polynomial in $n$. Earlier protocols have achieved only two of these three properties. In particular, the protocol of Bracha is not polynomially efficient, the protocol of Feldman and Micali is not optimally resilient, and the protocol of Canetti and Rabin does not have almost-sure termination. Our protocol utilizes a new primitive called shunning (asynchronous) verifiable secret sharing (SVSS), which ensures, roughly speaking, that either a secret is successfully shared or a new faulty process is ignored from this point onwards by some nonfaulty process. 
0808.01506	Magnetic dipolar interaction in an atomic Bose Einstein condensate interferometer	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:M. Fattori, G. Roati, B. Deissler, C. D'Errico, M. Zaccanti, M. Jona-Lasinio, L. Santos, M. Inguscio, G. Modugno	Abstract:  We study the role played by the magnetic dipole interaction in an atomic interferometer based on an alkali Bose-Einstein condensate with tunable scattering length. We tune the s-wave interaction to zero using a magnetic Feshbach resonance and measure the decoherence of the interferometer induced by the weak residual interaction between the magnetic dipoles of the atoms. We prove that with a proper choice of the scattering length it is possible to compensate for the dipolar interaction and extend the coherence time of the interferometer. We put in evidence the anisotropic character of the dipolar interaction by working with two different experimental configurations for which the minima of decoherence are achieved for a positive and a negative value of the scattering length, respectively. Our results are supported by a theoretical model we develop. This model indicates that the magnetic dipole interaction should not represent a serious source of decoherence in atom interferometers based on Bose-Einstein condensates. 
0808.01507	New results on the least common multiple of consecutive integers	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Bakir Farhi, Daniel Kane	Abstract:  When studying the least common multiple of some finite sequences of integers, the first author introduced the interesting arithmetic functions $g_k$ $(k \in \mathbb{N})$, defined by $g_k(n) := \frac{n (n + 1) ... (n + k)}{\lcm(n, n + 1, >..., n + k)}$ $(\forall n \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{0\})$. He proved that $g_k$ $(k \in \mathbb{N})$ is periodic and $k!$ is a period of $g_k$. He raised the open problem consisting to determine the smallest positive period $P_k$ of $g_k$. Very recently, S. Hong and Y. Yang have improved the period $k!$ of $g_k$ to $\lcm(1, 2, ..., k)$. In addition, they have conjectured that $P_k$ is always a multiple of the positive integer $\frac{\lcm(1, 2, >..., k, k + 1)}{k + 1}$. An immediate consequence of this conjecture states that if $(k + 1)$ is prime then the exact period of $g_k$ is precisely equal to $\lcm(1, 2, ..., k)$. In this paper, we first prove the conjecture of S. Hong and Y. Yang and then we give the exact value of $P_k$ $(k \in \mathbb{N})$. We deduce, as a corollary, that $P_k$ is equal to the part of $\lcm(1, 2, ..., k)$ not divisible by some prime.

0808.01509	Regular dependence on initial data for stochastic evolution equations with multiplicative Poisson noise	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Carlo Marinelli, Claudia Prévôt, Michael Röckner	Abstract:  We prove existence, uniqueness and Lipschitz dependence on the initial datum for mild solutions of stochastic partial differential equations with Lipschitz coefficients driven by Wiener and Poisson noise. Under additional assumptions, we prove Gateaux and Frechet differentiability of solutions with respect to the initial datum. As an application, we obtain gradient estimates for the resolvent associated to the mild solution. Finally, we prove the strong Feller property of the associated semigroup. 
0808.01510	The effect of stellar winds on the formation of a protocluster	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. E. Dale, I.A. Bonnell	Abstract:  We present SPH simulations of protoclusters including the effects of winds from massive stars. Using a particle-injection method, we investigate the effect of structure close to the wind sources and the short-timescale influence of winds on protoclusters. Structures such as disks and gaseous filaments have a strong collimating effect. By a different technique of injecting momentum from point sources, we compare the large-scale, long-term effects of isotropic and intrinsically-collimated winds and find them to be similar. Both types of wind dramatically slow the global star formation process, but the timescale on which they expel significant mass from the cluster is rather long (approaching 10 freefall times). Clusters may then experience rapid star formation early in their lifetimes, before switching to a mode where gas is gradually expelled, while star formation proceeds much more slowly. This complicates conclusions regarding slow star formation derived from measuring the star-formation efficiency per freefall time. Estimates of the efficacy of winds in dispersing clusters derived simply from the total wind momentum flux may not be very reliable. This is due to material being expelled from deep within stellar potential wells, often to velocities well in excess of the cluster escape velocity, and also to the loss of momentum flux through holes in the gas distribution. Winds have little effect on the accretion--driven stellar IMF except at the very high-mass end, where they serve to prevent some of the most massive objects accreting. We also find that the morphology of the gas, the rapid motions of the wind sources and the action of accretion flows prevent the formation of bubble-like structures. This may make it difficult to discern the influence of winds on very young clusters. 
0808.01511	A mathematical interpretation of the Feynman path integral equivalent to the formalism of Green functions	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:A. V. Stoyanovsky	Abstract:  We define the notion of distribution on an infinite dimensional space motivated by the notion of Feynman path integral and by construction of probability measures for generalized random fields. This notion of distribution turns out to be mathematically equivalent to the notion of generating functional of Green functions. 
0808.01512	The Electroweak Phase Transition in Nearly Conformal Technicolor	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:James M. Cline,  (McGill University), Matti Jarvinen, Francesco Sannino,  (HEC, University of Southern Denmark)    	Abstract:  We examine the temperature-dependent electroweak phase transition in extensions of the Standard Model in which the electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken via strongly coupled, nearly-conformal dynamics. In particular, we focus on the low energy effective theory used to describe Minimal Walking Technicolor at the phase transition. Using the one-loop effective potential with ring improvement, we identify significant regions of parameter space which yield a sufficiently strong first order transition for electroweak baryogenesis. The composite particle spectrum corresponding to these regions can be produced and studied at the Large Hadron Collider experiment. We note the possible emergence of a second phase transition at lower temperatures. This occurs when the underlying technicolor theory possesses a nontrivial center symmetry. 
0808.01513	Optimal Markov Approximations and Generalized Embeddings	Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)	Authors:Detlef Holstein, Holger Kantz	Abstract:  Based on information theory, we present a method to determine an optimal Markov approximation for modelling and prediction from time series data. The method finds a balance between minimal modelling errors by taking as much as possible memory into account and minimal statistical errors by working in embedding spaces of rather small dimension. A key ingredient is an estimate of the statistical error of entropy estimates. The method is illustrated with several examples and the consequences for prediction are evaluated by means of the root mean squard prediction error for point prediction. 
0808.01514	Shape waves in 2D Josephson junctions: exact solutions and time dilation	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:D. R. Gulevich, F. V. Kusmartsev, S. Savel'ev, V. A. Yampol'skii, F. Nori	Abstract:  We predict a new class of excitations propagating along a Josephson vortex in two-dimensional Josephson junctions. These excitations are associated with the distortion of a Josephson vortex line and have an analogy with shear waves in solid mechanics. Their shapes can have an arbitrary profile, which is retained when propagating. We derive a universal analytical expression for the energy of arbitrary shape excitations, investigate their influence on the dynamics of a vortex line, and discuss conditions where such excitations can be created. Finally, we show that such excitations play the role of a clock for a relativistically-moving Josephson vortex and suggest an experiment to measure a time dilation effect analogous to that in special relativity. 
0808.01515	On the application of homotopy--perturbation and Adomian decomposition methods to the linear and nonlinear Schrödinger equations	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Francisco M. Fernández	Abstract:  I discuss a recent application of homotopy perturbation and Adomian decomposition methods to the linear and nonlinear Schrödinger equations. I propose a generalization of the procedure for the treatment of a wider class of problems. 
0808.01516	Anomalous Josephson Current in Junctions with Spin-Polarizing Quantum Point Contacts	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:A. A. Reynoso, Gonzalo Usaj, C. A. Balseiro, D. Feinberg, M. Avignon	Abstract:  We consider a ballistic Josephson junction with a quantum point contact in a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The point contact acts as a spin filter when embedded in a circuit with normal electrodes. We show that with an in-plane external magnetic field an anomalous supercurrent appears even for zero phase difference between the superconducting electrodes. In addition, the external field induces large critical current asymmetries between the two flow directions, leading to supercurrent rectifying effects. 
0808.01517	The power of multifolds: Folding the algebraic closure of the rational numbers	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Timothy Y. Chow, C. Kenneth Fan	Abstract:  It is well known that the usual Huzita-Hatori axioms for origami enable angle trisection but not angle quintisection. Using the concept of a multifold, Lang has achieved quintisection but not arbitrary algebraic numbers. We define the n-parameter multifold and show how to use one-parameter multifolds to obtain the algebraic closure of the rational numbers. 
0808.01518	Constructive Gelfand duality for C*-algebras	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Thierry Coquand, Bas Spitters	Abstract:  We present a constructive proof of Gelfand duality for C*-algebras by reducing the problem to Gelfand duality for real C*-algebras. 
0808.01519	De Morgan classifying toposes	Category Theory (math.CT)	Authors:Olivia Caramello	Abstract:  We present a general method for deciding whether a Grothendieck topos satisfies De Morgan's law (resp. the law of excluded middle) or not; applications to the theory of classifying toposes follow. Specifically, we obtain a syntactic characterization of the class of geometric theories whose classifying toposes satisfy De Morgan's law (resp. are Boolean), as well as model-theoretic criteria for theories whose classifying toposes arise as localizations of a given presheaf topos. 
0808.01520	Resonant excitations of single and two-qubit systems coupled to a tank circuit	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:S.N. Shevchenko, S.H.W. van der Ploeg, M. Grajcar, E. Il'ichev, A.N. Omelyanchouk, H.-G. Meyer	Abstract:  The interaction of flux qubits with a low frequency tank circuit is studied. It is shown that changes in the state of the interacting qubits influence the effective impedance of the circuit, which is the essence of the so-called impedance measurement technique. The multiphoton resonant excitations in both single flux qubits and pairs of coupled flux qubits are investigated. In particular, we compare our theoretical results with recent spectroscopy measurements, Landau-Zener interferometry, and multiphoton fringes. 
0808.01521	Radial kinematics of brightest cluster galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S.I. Loubser, A.E. Sansom, P. Sanchez-Blazquez, I.K. Soechting, G.E. Bromage	Abstract:  This is the first of a series of papers devoted to the investigation of a large sample of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), their kinematic and stellar population properties, and the relationships between those and the properties of the cluster. We have obtained high signal-to-noise ratio, long-slit spectra of these galaxies with Gemini and WHT with the primary purpose of investigating their stellar population properties. This paper describes the selection methods and criteria used to compile a new sample of galaxies, concentrating on BCGs previously classified as containing a halo (cD galaxies), together with the observations and data reduction. Here, we present the full sample of galaxies, and the measurement and interpretation of the radial velocity and velocity dispersion profiles of 41 BCGs. We find clear rotation curves for a number of these giant galaxies. In particular, we find rapid rotation (> 100 km/s) for two BCGs, NGC6034 and NGC7768, indicating that it is unlikely that they formed through dissipationless mergers. Velocity substructure in the form of kinematically decoupled cores is detected in 12 galaxies, and we find five galaxies with velocity dispersion increasing with radius. The amount of rotation, the velocity substructure and the position of BCGs on the anisotropy-luminosity diagram are very similar to those of "ordinary" giant ellipticals in high density environments. 
0808.01522	Integrals and Valuations	Logic (math.LO)	Authors:Thierry Coquand, Bas Spitters	Abstract:  We construct a homeomorphism between the compact regular locale of integrals on a Riesz space and the locale of (valuations) on its spectrum. In fact, we construct two geometric theories and show that they are biinterpretable. The constructions are elementary and tightly connected to the Riesz space structure. 
0808.01523	Two-loop neutrino masses with large R-parity violating interactions in supersymmetry	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Paramita Dey, Anirban Kundu, Biswarup Mukhopadhyaya, Soumitra Nandi	Abstract:  We attempt to reconcile large trilinear R-parity violating interactions in a supersymmetric (SUSY) theory with the observed pattern of neutrino masses and mixing. We show that, with a restricted number of such interaction terms with the $λ'$-type couplings in the range (0.1-1.0), it is possible to forbid one-loop contributions to the neutrino mass matrix. This is illustrated with the help of a `working example' where an econnomic choice of SUSY parameters is made, with three non-vanishing and `large' R-parity violating terms in the superpotential. The two-loop contributions in such a case can not only generate the masses in the requisite order but can also lead us to specific allowed regions of the parameter space. 
0808.01524	High-Frequency Microstrip Cross Resonators for Circular Polarization EPR Spectroscopy	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:J. J. Henderson, C. M. Ramsey, H. M. Quddusi, E. del Barco	Abstract:  In this article we discuss the design and implementation of a novel microstrip resonator which allows for the absolute control of the microwaves polarization degree for frequencies up to 30 GHz. The sensor is composed of two half-wavelength microstrip line resonators, designed to match the 50 Ohms impedance of the lines on a high dielectric constant GaAs substrate. The line resonators cross each other perpendicularly through their centers, forming a cross. Microstrip feed lines are coupled through small gaps to three arms of the cross to connect the resonator to the excitation ports. The control of the relative magnitude and phase between the two microwave stimuli at the input ports of each line allows for tuning the degree and type of polarization of the microwave excitation at the center of the cross resonator. The third (output) port is used to measure the transmitted signal, which is crucial to work at low temperatures, where reflections along lengthy coaxial lines mask the signal reflected by the resonator. EPR spectra recorded at low temperature in an S= 5/2 molecular magnet system show that 82%-fidelity circular polarization of the microwaves is achieved over the central area of the resonator. 
0808.01525	Bounding sup-norms of cusp forms of large level	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Valentin Blomer, Roman Holowinsky	Abstract:  Let f be an $L^2$-normalized weight zero Hecke-Maass cusp form of square-free level N, character $χ$ and Laplacian eigenvalue $λ\geq 1/4$. It is shown that $\| f \|_{\infty} \ll_λ N^{-1/37}$, from which the hybrid bound $\|f \|_{\infty} \ll λ^{1/4} (Nλ)^{-δ}$ (for some $δ> 0$) is derived. The first bound holds also for $f = y^{k/2}F$ where F is a holomorphic cusp form of weight k with the implied constant now depending on k. 
0808.01526	Comment on "Gauge Invariance and $k_T$-Factorization of Exclusive Processes"	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Hsiang-nan Li, Satoshi Mishima	Abstract:  We point out mistakes made in the one-loop calculation of some diagrams for the process $πγ^* \to γ$ in the preprint arXiv:0807.0296, and present correct results. Especially, we have difficulty to understand their argument that a highly off-shell gluon generates a light-cone (infrared) singularity. It is shown by means of the Ward identity that the gauge-dependent light-cone singularity found in arXiv:0807.0296 does not exist. It is then shown that a hard kernel derived in the $k_T$ factorization of exclusive processes is gauge invariant and free of the light-cone singularity. 
0808.01527	An alternative parameterisation for binary-lens caustic-crossing events	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Cassan (ARI/ZAH, University of Heidelberg, Germany)    	Abstract:  Microlensing events are being discovered and alerted by the two survey teams OGLE and MOA at an increasing rate. Around ten percent of these events involve binary lenses. Such events potentially contain much information on the physical properties of the observed binary systems, which can then be used for e.g. statistical studies on binary objects in the Galactic disk or bulge. However, such events are usually not straightforward to study, because the model equations are strongly non-linear and there are many local minima that can fool the search for the best solution if the parameter space is not inspected with great care. In this work an alternative parameterisation for the binary lens fitting problem is proposed, in which the parameters involved are defined to represent as closely as possible the caustic-crossing features observed in most binary lens light curves. Furthermore, we work out an extension of the method in order to make use of the straight line fold caustic approximation, when the latter applies for both the caustic entry and exit. We introduce an alternative parameterisation in order to confine the exploration of the parameter space to regions where the models only involve caustic crossing at the dates seen in the light curve. We find that the proposed parameterisation provides more robustness to the light curve fitting process, in particular in avoiding a code to get stuck in false minima. 
0808.01528	Eigenvalue Asymptotics in a Twisted Waveguide	Spectral Theory (math.SP)	Authors:Philippe Briet, Hynek Kovarik, Georgi Raikov, Eric Soccorsi	Abstract:  We consider a twisted quantum wave guide, and are interested in the spectral analysis of the associated Dirichlet Laplacian H. We show that if the derivative of rotation angle decays slowly enough at infinity, then there is an infinite sequence of discrete eigenvalues lying below the infimum of the essential spectrum of H, and obtain the main asymptotic term of this sequence. 
0808.01529	On the complexity group of stable curves	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Simone Busonero, Margarida Melo, Lidia Stoppino	Abstract:  In this paper, we study combinatorial properties of stable curves. To the dual graph of any nodal curve, it is naturally associated a group, which is the group of components of the Néron model of the generalized Jacobian of the curve. We study the order of this group, called the complexity. In particular, we provide a partial characterization of the stable curves having maximal complexity, and we provide an upper bound, depending only on the genus $g$ of the curve, on the maximal complexity of stable curves; this bound is asymptotically sharp for $g\gg 0$. Eventually, we state some conjectures on the behavior of stable curves with maximal complexity, and prove partial results in this direction. 
0808.01530	Tan(beta)-enhanced supersymmetric corrections to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Schedar Marchetti, Susanne Mertens, Ulrich Nierste, Dominik Stöckinger	Abstract:  We report on a two-loop supersymmetric contribution to the magnetic moment (g-2)_mu of the muon which is enhanced by two powers of tan(beta). This contribution arises from a shift in the relation between the muon mass and Yukawa coupling and can increase the supersymmetric contribution to (g-2)_mu sizably. As a result, if the currently observed 3 sigma deviation between the experimental and SM theory value of (g-2)_mu is analyzed within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the derived constraints on the parameter space are modified significantly: If (g-2)_mu is used to determine tan(beta) as a function of the other MSSM parameters, our corrections decrease tan(beta) by roughly 10% for tan(beta)=50. 
0808.01531	A statistical approximation to solve ordinary differential equations	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:M. L. Alemany, M. Febbo, S. A. Vera	Abstract:  We propose a physical analogy between finding the solution of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and a $N$ particle problem in statistical mechanics. It uses the fact that the solution of an ODE is equivalent to obtain the minimum of a functional. Then, we link these two notions, proposing this functional to be the interaction potential energy or thermodynamic potential of an equivalent particle problem. Therefore, solving this statistical mechanics problem amounts to solve the ODE. If only one solution exists, our method provides the unique solution of the ODE. In case we treat an eigenvalue equation, where infinite solutions exist, we obtain the absolute minimum of the corresponding functional or fundamental mode. As a result, it is possible to establish a general relationship between statistical mechanics and ODEs which allows not only to solve them from a physical perspective but also to obtain all relevant thermodynamical equilibrium variables of that particle system related to the differential equation. 
0808.01532	Graph States for Quantum Secret Sharing	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Damian Markham, Barry C. Sanders	Abstract:  We consider three broad classes of quantum secret sharing with and without eavesdropping and show how a graph state formalism unifies otherwise disparate quantum secret sharing models. In addition to the elegant unification provided by graph states, our approach provides a generalization of threshold classical secret sharing via insecure quantum channels beyond the current requirement of 100% collaboration by players to just a simple majority in the case of five players. Another innovation here is the introduction of embedded protocols within a larger graph state that serves as a one-way quantum information processing system. 
0808.01533	The third order helicity of magnetic fields via link maps	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:R. Komendarczyk	Abstract:  We introduce an alternative approach to the third order helicity of a volume preserving vector field $B$, which leads us to a lower bound for the $L^2$-energy of $B$. The proposed approach exploits correspondence between the Milnor $\barμ_{123}$-invariant for 3-component links and the homotopy invariants of maps to configuration spaces, and we provide a simple geometric proof of this fact in the case of Borromean links. Based on these connections we develop a formulation for the third order helicity of $B$ on invariant \emph{unlinked} domains of $B$, and provide Arnold's style ergodic interpretation of this invariant as an average asymptotic $\barμ_{123}$-invariant of orbits of $B$. 
0808.01534	The derivative nonlinear Schrödinger equation on the half-line	Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)	Authors:Jonatan Lenells	Abstract:  We analyze the derivative nonlinear Schrödinger equation $iq_t + q_{xx} = i(|q|^2q)_x$ on the half-line using the Fokas method. Assuming that the solution $q(x,t)$ exists, we show that it can be represented in terms of the solution of a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem formulated in the plane of the complex spectral parameter $ζ$. The jump matrix has explicit $x,t$ dependence and is given in terms of the spectral functions $a(ζ)$, $b(ζ)$ (obtained from the initial data $q_0(x) = q(x,0)$) as well as $A(ζ)$, $B(ζ)$ (obtained from the boundary values $g_0(t) = q(0,t)$ and $g_1(t) = q_x(0,t)$). The spectral functions are not independent, but related by a compatibility condition, the so-called global relation. Given initial and boundary values $\{q_0(x), g_0(t), g_1(t)\}$ such that there exist spectral function satisfying the global relation, we show that the function $q(x,t)$ defined by the above Riemann-Hilbert problem exists globally and solves the derivative nonlinear Schrödinger equation with the prescribed initial and boundary values. 
0808.01535	Nonabelian Generalized Gauge Multiplets	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Ulf Lindstrom, Martin Rocek, Itai Ryb, Rikard von Unge, Maxim Zabzine	Abstract:  We give the nonabelian extension of the newly discovered N = (2, 2) two-dimensional vector multiplets. These can be used to gauge symmetries of sigma models on generalized Kahler geometries. Starting from the transformation rule for the nonabelian case we find covariant derivatives and gauge covariant field-strengths and write their actions in N = (2, 2) and N = (1, 1) superspace. 
0808.01536	Direct observation of quantum criticality in Ising spin chains	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Jingfu Zhang, Fernando M. Cucchietti, C. M. Chandrashekar, Martin Laforest, Colm A. Ryan, Michael Ditty, Adam Hubbard, John K. Gamble, Raymond Laflamme	Abstract:  We use NMR quantum simulators to study antiferromagnetic Ising spin chains undergoing quantum phase transitions. Taking advantage of the sensitivity of the systems near criticality, we detect the critical points of the transitions using a direct measurement of the Loschmidt echo. We test our simulators for spin chains of even and odd numbers of spins, and compare the experimental results to theoretical predictions. 
0808.01537	On Spectral Gap,U(1) Symmetry and Split Property in Quantum Spin Chains	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Taku Matsui	Abstract:  We consider a class of ground states for quantum spin chains on an integer lattice. First we show that presence of the spectral gap between the ground state energy and the rest of spectrum implies the split property of certain subsystems.As a corollary, we show that gapless excitation exists for spinless Fermion if the pure gauge invariant ground state is non-trivial and translationally invariant. 
0808.01538	Heterogeneous expectations and long range correlation of the volatility of asset returns	Statistical Finance (q-fin.ST)	Authors:Jerome Coulon, Yannick Malevergne	Abstract:  Inspired by the recent literature on aggregation theory, we aim at relating the long range correlation of the stocks return volatility to the heterogeneity of the investors' expectations about the level of the future volatility. Based on a semi-parametric model of investors' anticipations, we make the connection between the distributional properties of the heterogeneity parameters and the auto-covariance/auto-correlation functions of the realized volatility. We report different behaviors, or change of convention, whose observation depends on the market phase under consideration. In particular, we report and justify the fact that the volatility exhibits significantly longer memory during the phases of speculative bubble than during the phase of recovery following the collapse of a speculative bubble. 
0808.01539	The kinetic temperature of a molecular cloud at redshift 0.9: Ammonia in the gravitational lens PKS1830-211	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:C. Henkel, J.A. Braatz, K.M. Menten, J. Ott	Abstract:  Using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), we have detected the (J,K) = (1,1) to (10,10) ammonia inversion lines, up to 1030 K above the ground state, in a face-on spiral galaxy viewed against the radio continuum of the lensed background source PKS 1830-211. The ammonia absorption lines, seen at redshift 0.886, appear to be optically thin with absolute peak flux densities up to 2.5 percent of the total continuum of the background source. Measured intensities are consistent with a kinetic temperature of 80 K for 80-90 percent of the ammonia column. The remaining gas is warmer, reaching at least 600 K. Column density and fractional abundance are of order (5-10) x 10^14 cm^-2 and (1.5-3.0) x 10^-8. Similarities with a hot ammonia absorption component observed toward the Sgr B2 region close to the Galactic center may suggest that the Sgr B2 component also originates from warm diffuse low-density molecular gas. The warm ammonia column observed toward PKS 1830-211 is unique in the sense that it originates in a spiral arm. 
0808.01540	The magnetic field and the location of the TeV emitter in Cygnus X-1 and LS 5039	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:V. Bosch-Ramon, D. Khangulyan, F. A. Aharonian	Abstract:  Cygnus X-1 and LS 5039 are two X-ray binaries observed at TeV energies. Both sources are compact systems, contain jet-like (radio) structures, and harbor very luminous O stars. A TeV signal has been found around the superior conjunction of the compact object in both objects, when the highest gamma-ray opacities are expected. We investigate the implications of finding TeV emission from Cygnus X-1 and LS 5039 around the superior conjunction, since this can give information on the system magnetic field and the location of the TeV emitter. Using the very high-energy spectra and fluxes observed around the superior conjunction in Cygnus X-1 and LS 5039, we compute the absorbed luminosity that is caused by pair creation in the stellar photon field for different emitter positions with respect to the star and the observer line of sight. The role of the magnetic field and electromagnetic cascading are discussed. For the case of inefficient electromagnetic cascading, the expected secondary synchrotron fluxes are compared with the observed ones at X-ray energies. We find that, in Cygnus X-1 and LS 5039, either the magnetic field in the star surroundings is much smaller than the one expected for O stars or the TeV emitter is located at a distance >10^12 cm from the compact object. Our results strongly suggest that the TeV emitters in Cygnus X-1 and LS 5039 are located at the borders of the binary system and well above the orbital plane. This would not agree with those models for which the emitter is well inside the system, like the innermost-jet region (Cygnus X-1 and LS 5039; microquasar scenario), or the region between the pulsar and the primary star (LS 5039; standard pulsar scenario). 
0808.01541	About the inconsistency between Bohr-Wheelers transition-state method and Kramers' escape rate in nuclear fission	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:K.-H. Schmidt	Abstract:  The problem of an apparent inconsistency between the fission rates derived on the basis of Bohr-Wheeler's transition-state method and Kramers' dynamical model of nuclear fission, first pointed out by Strutinsky in 1973, is revisited. The study is based on studying the features of individual trajectories on the fission path. 
0808.01542	Tevatron Electron Lenses: Design and Operation	Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph)	Authors:Vladimir Shiltsev, Kip Bishofberger, Vsevolod Kamerdzhiev, Sergei Kozub, Matthew Kufer, Gennady Kuznetsov, Alexander Martinez, Marvin Olson, Howard Pfeffer, Greg Saewert, Vic Scarpine, Andrey Seryi, Nikolai Solyak, Veniamin Sytnik, Mikhail Tiunov, Leonid Tkachenko, David Wildman, Daniel Wolff, Xiao-Long Zhang	Abstract:  The beam-beam effects have been the dominating sources of beam loss and lifetime limitations in the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider [1]. Electron lenses were originally proposed for compensation of electromagnetic long-range and head-on beam-beam interactions of proton and antiproton beams [2]. Results of successful employment of two electron lenses built and installed in the Tevatron are reported in [3,4,5]. In this paper we present design features of the Tevatron electron lenses (TELs), discuss the generation of electron beams, describe different modes of operation and outline the technical parameters of various subsystems. 
0808.01543	Study of the pi+pi-J/psi Mass Spectrum via Initial-State Radiation at BABAR	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BaBar Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We present an update of the study of the Y(4260) resonance, produced in the process $e^+e^-\toγ_{ISR} π^+π^-J/ψ$ using initial-state radiation events at the PEP-II $e^+e^-$ storage rings. This study is based on 454fb$^{-1}$ of data recorded with the {\slshape B\kern-0.1em{\smaller A}\kern-0.1em B\kern-0.1em{\smaller A\kern-0.2em R}} detector at a center-of-mass energy in the $Υ(4S)$ resonance region. From a fit with a single non-relativistic Breit-Wigner shape we obtain updated parameters for the Y(4260) resonance which are $m_Y = 4252 \pm6 ^{+2}_{-3}$MeV/c$^2$ and $Γ_Y = 105 \pm 18^{+4}_{-6}$MeV/c$^2$; we also measure ${\calB}(π^+π^-J/ψ)Γ_{e^+e^-} = (7.5\pm 0.9 \pm0.8)$ eV. We cannot confirm the recent BELLE observation of a broad structure around 4.05GeV/c$^2$ in this decay mode. 
0808.01544	Muon Capture on the Proton and Deuteron	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:Frederick Gray (for the MuCap and MuSun Collaborations)    	Abstract:  By measuring the lifetime of the negative muon in pure protium (hydrogen-1), the MuCap experiment determines the rate of muon capture on the proton, from which the proton's pseudoscalar coupling g_p may be inferred. A precision of 15% for g_p has been published; this is a step along the way to a goal of 7%. This coupling can be calculated precisely from heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory and therefore permits a test of QCD's chiral symmetry. Meanwhile, the MuSun experiment is in its final design stage; it will measure the rate of muon capture on the deuteron using a similar technique. This process can be related through pionless effective field theory and chiral perturbation theory to other two-nucleon reactions of astrophysical interest, including proton-proton fusion and deuteron breakup. 
0808.01545	Flares as fingerprints of inner solar darkness	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:K. Zioutas, M. Tsagri, Y. Semertzidis, T. Papaevangelou	Abstract:  X-ray flares and other solar brightenings have been discarded as potential axion signatures. An axion X-ray signal must appear exclusively near the disk centre, and its spectrum must peak at ~4.2keV, contrary to observation. We argue here that due to Compton scattering off the (plasma) electrons the outward propagation of X-rays from axions converted near the Sun's surface can explain energy distribution and non direcivity. Simulation points at the photosphere as the birth place of the presumed axion conversion, implying an axion rest mass of ~0.01eV. At present, even optimistic parameter values can not reproduce the measured intensities. The simulated photon spectrum peaks at low energies. Quiet Sun hard X-rays are in favour of massive and/or light axion involvement. 
0808.01546	The Study of Entangled States in Quantum Computation and Quantum Information Science	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Hyeyoun Chung	Abstract:  This thesis explores the use of entangled states in quantum computation and quantum information science. Entanglement, a quantum phenomenon with no classical counterpart, has been identified as an important and quantifiable resource in many areas of theoretical quantum information science, including quantum error correction, quantum cryptography, and quantum algorithms. We first investigate the equivalence classes of a particular class of entangled states (known as graph states due to their association with mathematical graphs) under local operations. We prove that for graph states corresponding to graphs with neither cycles of length 3 nor 4, the equivalence classes can be characterized in a very simple way. We also present software for analyzing and manipulating graph states. We then study quantum error-correcting codes whose codewords are highly entangled states. An important area of investigation concerning QECCs is to determine which resources are necessary in order to carry out any computation on the code to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while simultaneously maintaining a high degree of resistance to noise. We prove that transversal gates, which are designed to prevent the propagation of errors through a system, are insufficient to achieve universal computation on almost all QECCs. Finally, we study the problem of creating efficient quantum circuits for creating entangling measurements. Entangling measurements can be used to harness the apparent extra computing power of quantum systems by allowing us to extract information about the global, collective properties of a quantum state using local measurements. We construct explicit quantum circuits that create entangling measurements, and show that these circuits scale polynomially in the input parameters. 
0808.01547	Integration with Functions of a Quaternionic Variable	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Charles Schwartz	Abstract:  Recent innovations in the differential calculus for functions of non-commuting variables, beginning with a quaternionic variable, are now extended to consider some integration. 
0808.01548	Vortices near the Mott phase of a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Daniel S. Goldbaum, Erich J. Mueller	Abstract:  We present a theoretical study of vortices within a harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensate in a rotating optical lattice. We find that proximity to the Mott insulating state dramatically effects the vortex structures. To illustrate we give examples in which the vortices: (i) all sit at a fixed distance from the center of the trap, forming a ring, or (ii) coalesce at the center of the trap, forming a giant vortex. We model time-of-flight expansion to demonstrate the experimental observability of our predictions. 
0808.01549	The Peculiar Phase Structure of Random Graph Bisection	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Allon G. Percus, Gabriel Istrate, Bruno Goncalves, Robert Z. Sumi, Stefan Boettcher	Abstract:  The mincut graph bisection problem involves partitioning the n vertices of a graph into disjoint subsets, each containing exactly n/2 vertices, while minimizing the number of "cut" edges with an endpoint in each subset. When considered over sparse random graphs, the phase structure of the graph bisection problem displays certain familiar properties, but also some surprises. It is known that when the mean degree is below the critical value of 2 log 2, the cutsize is zero with high probability. We study how the minimum cutsize increases with mean degree above this critical threshold, finding a new analytical upper bound that improves considerably upon previous bounds. Combined with recent results on expander graphs, our bound suggests the unusual scenario that random graph bisection is replica symmetric up to and beyond the critical threshold, with a replica symmetry breaking transition possibly taking place above the threshold. An intriguing algorithmic consequence is that although the problem is NP-hard, we can find near-optimal cutsizes (whose ratio to the optimal value approaches 1 asymptotically) in polynomial time for typical instances near the phase transition. 
0808.01550	Smoothable del Pezzo surfaces with quotient singularities	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Paul Hacking, Yuri Prokhorov	Abstract:  We give a complete classification of del Pezzo surfaces with quotient singularities and Picard rank 1 which admit a Q-Gorenstein smoothing. There are 14 infinite families of toric examples. The surfaces in each family correspond to solutions of a Markov-type equation. The remaining surfaces are obtained as deformations of the toric surfaces or belong to a finite list of sporadic surfaces. 
0808.01551	On SYZ mirror transformations	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Kwokwai Chan, Naichung Conan Leung	Abstract:  In this expository paper, we discuss how Fourier-Mukai-type transformations, which we call SYZ mirror transformations, can be applied to provide a geometric understanding of the mirror symmetry phenomena for semi-flat Calabi-Yau manifolds and toric Fano manifolds. We also speculate the possible applications of these transformations to other more general settings. 
0808.01552	Note on the thermal history of decoupled massive particles	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Hongbao Zhang	Abstract:  This note provides an alternative approach to the momentum decay and thermal evolution of decoupled massive particles. Although the ingredients in our results have been addressed in Ref.\cite{Weinberg}, the strategies employed here are simpler, and the results obtained here are more general. 
0808.01553	Remark on quantum mechanics with conformal Galilean symmetry	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:A.V. Galajinsky	Abstract:  Conformal Galilei algebra contains so(1,2) subalgebra which is the conformal algebra in one dimension. In this note we generalize methods previously developed for one-dimensional many-body systems and construct a unitary map relating a quantum mechanics invariant under the conformal Galilean transformations to a set of decoupled particles for which the same symmetry is realized in a nonlocal way. Possible applications of the map are discussed. 
0808.01554	Long wavelength limit of two dimensional photonic crystals	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:S. T. chui, Z. F. Lin	Abstract:  We solve {\bf analytically} the multiple scattering (KKR) equations for the two dimensional photonic crystals in the long wavelength limit. Different approximations of the electric and magnetic susceptibilities are presented from a unified pseudopotential point of view. The nature of the so called plasmon-polariton bands are clarified. Its frequency as a function of the wire radius is discussed. 
0808.01555	Recent star formation in nearby 3CR radio-galaxies from UV HST observations	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ranieri D. Baldi (1), Alessandro Capetti (2) ((1) Universita' degli Studi di Torino, Italy (2) INAF - Osservatorio Astronomico di Torino, Italy)    	Abstract:  We analyzed HST images of 31 nearby (z <~ 0.1) 3CR radio-galaxies. We compared their UV and optical images to detect evidence of recent star formation. Six objects were excluded because they are highly nucleated or had very low UV count rates. After subtracting the emission from their nuclei and/or jets, 12 of the remaining 25 objects, presenting an UV/optical colors NUV - r < 5.4, are potential star-forming candidates. Considering the contamination from other AGN-related processes (UV emission lines, nebular continuum, and scattered nuclear light), there are 6 remaining star-forming "blue" galaxies. We then divide the radio galaxies, on the basis of the radio morphology, radio power, and diagnostic optical line ratios, into low and high excitation galaxies, LEG and HEG. While there is no correlation between the FR type (or radio power) and color, the FR type is clearly related to the spectroscopic type. In fact, all HEG (with one possible exception) show morphological evidence of recent star formation in UV compact knots, extended over 5-20 kpc. Conversely, there is only 1 "blue" LEG out of 19, including in this class also FR I galaxies. The picture that emerges, considering color, UV, optical, and dust morphology, is that only in HEG recent star formation is associated with these relatively powerful AGN, which are most likely triggered by a recent, major, wet merger. Conversely, in LEG galaxies the fraction of actively star-forming objects is not enhanced with respect to quiescent galaxies. The AGN activity in these sources can be probably self-sustained by their hot interstellar medium.

Amaro, J. Veloso, J.M.F. Dos Santos	Abstract:  We shortly describe recent progress in photon detectors combining bi-alkali photocathodes and cascaded patterned gas-avalanche electron multipliers. It permitted the development and the first feasibility demonstration of high-gain gaseous photomultipliers sensitive in the visible spectral range, operated in DC mode with single-photon sensitivity. 
0808.01557	Superconductivity at 2.2K in La3Ni4P4O2	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:T. Klimczuk, T. M. McQueen, A. J. Williams, Q. Huang, F. Ronning, E. D. Bauer, J. D. Thompson, M. A. Green, R. J. Cava	Abstract:  We report the observation of superconductivity in La3Ni4P4O2 at 2.2 K. The layer stacking in this compound results in an asymmetric distribution of charge reservoir layers around the Ni2P2 planes. The estimated Wilson ratio, Rw ~ 5, indicates the presence of a strongly enhanced normal state susceptibility, but many of the basic superconducting characteristics are conventional. The estimated electronic contribution to the specific heat, gamma ~ 6.2 mJ mol-Ni^-1K^-2, is about 2/3 of that found in layered nickel borocarbide superconductors. 
0808.01558	Quantum algorithm design using dynamic learning	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:E.C. Behrman, J.E. Steck, P. Kumar, K.A. Walsh	Abstract:  We present a dynamic learning paradigm for "programming" a general quantum computer. A learning algorithm is used to find the control parameters for a coupled qubit system, such that the system at an initial time evolves to a state in which a given measurement corresponds to the desired operation. This can be thought of as a quantum neural network. We first apply the method to a system of two coupled superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), and demonstrate learning of both the classical gates XOR and XNOR. Training of the phase produces a gate congruent to the CNOT modulo a phase shift. Striking out for somewhat more interesting territory, we attempt learning of an entanglement witness for a two qubit system. Simulation shows a reasonably successful mapping of the entanglement at the initial time onto the correlation function at the final time for both pure and mixed states. For pure states this mapping requires knowledge of the phase relation between the two parts; however, given that knowledge, this method can be used to measure the entanglement of an otherwise unknown state. The method is easily extended to multiple qubits or to quNits. 
0808.01559	Global solutions in gravity. Euclidean signature	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:M.O.Katanaev	Abstract:  We consider a wide class of two-dimensional metrics having one Killing vector. The method is proposed for the construction of maximally extended surfaces with the given Riemannian metric which is the analog of the conformal block method for two-dimensional Lorentzian signature metrics. The Schwarzschild solution is considered as an example. 
0808.01560	Liouville Quantum Gravity and KPZ	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Bertrand Duplantier, Scott Sheffield	Abstract:  Consider a bounded planar domain D, an instance h of the Gaussian free field on D (with Dirichlet energy normalized by 1/(2π)), and a constant 0 < gamma < 2. The Liouville quantum gravity measure on D is the weak limit as epsilon tends to 0 of the measures ε^{γ^2/2} e^{γh_ε(z)}dz, where dz is Lebesgue measure on D and h_ε(z) denotes the mean value of h on the circle of radius epsilon centered at z. Given a random (or deterministic) subset X of D one can define the scaling dimension of X using either Lebesgue measure or this random measure. We derive a general quadratic relation between these two dimensions, which we view as a probabilistic formulation of the KPZ relation from conformal field theory. We also present a boundary analog of KPZ (for subsets of the boundary of D). We discuss the connection between discrete and continuum quantum gravity and provide a framework for understanding Euclidean scaling exponents via quantum gravity. 
0808.01561	Measuring Dislocation Density in Aluminum with Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Felipe Barra, Andres Caru, Maria Teresa Cerda, Rodrigo Espinoza, Alejandro Jara, Fernando Lund, Nicolas Mujica	Abstract:  Dislocations in a material will, when present in enough numbers, change the speed of propagation of elastic waves. Consequently, two material samples, differing only in dislocation density, will have different elastic constants, a quantity that can be measured using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy. Measurements of this effect on aluminum samples are reported. They compare well with the predictions of the theory. 
0808.01562	Persistence of zero modes in a gauged Dirac model for bilayer graphene	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:R. Jackiw, S.-Y. Pi	Abstract:  A recently constructed model for low lying excitations in bilayer graphene exhibits mid-gap, zero energy modes in its Dirac-like spectrum, when a scalar order parameter takes a vortex profile. We show that these modes persist when the dynamics is extended by a gauge field interaction, which also renders finite the vortex energy. The effect of the gauge field on the zero energy wave function is to shift the phase of the (damped) oscillatory component of the wave function in the absence of the gauge field. 
0808.01563	Beyond the frame rate: Measuring high-frequency fluctuations with light intensity modulation	Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)	Authors:Wesley Philip Wong (1), Ken Halvorsen (1) ((1) Rowland Institute at Harvard, Harvard University)    	Abstract:  Power spectral density measurements of any sampled signal are typically restricted by both acquisition rate and frequency response limitations of instruments, which can be particularly prohibitive for video-based measurements. We have developed a new method called Intensity Modulation Spectral Analysis (IMSA) that circumvents these limitations, dramatically extending the effective detection bandwidth. We demonstrate this by video-tracking an optically-trapped microsphere while oscillating an LED illumination source. This approach allows us to quantify fluctuations of the microsphere at frequencies over 10 times higher than the Nyquist frequency, mimicking a significantly higher frame rate. 
0808.01564	On the structure of the wave operators in one dimensional potential scattering	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Johannes Kellendonk, Serge Richard	Abstract:  In the framework of one dimensional potential scattering we prove that, modulo a compact term, the wave operators can be written in terms of a universal operator and of the scattering operator. The universal operator is related to the one dimensional Hilbert transform and can be expressed as a function of the generator of dilations. As a consequence, we show how Levinson's theorem can be rewritten as an index theorem, and obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the wave operators at high and low energy and at large and small scale. 
0808.01565	Obscured clusters. II. GLIMPSE-C02 - A new metal rich globular cluster in the Milky Way	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:R. Kurtev (1), V.D. Ivanov (2), J. Borissova (1), S. Ortolani (3) ((1) Valparaiso University, Chile (2) ESO, Chile (3)Padova University, Italy)    	Abstract:  The estimated total number of Milky Way globulars is 160+-20. The question of whether there are any more undiscovered globular clusters in the Milky Way is particularly relevant with advances in near and mid-IR instrumentation. This investigation is a part of a long-term project to search the inner Milky Way for hidden star clusters and to study them in detail. GLIMPSE-C02 (G02) is one of these objects, situated near the Galactic plane (l=14.129deg, b=-0.644deg). Our analysis is based on SOFI/NTT JHKs imaging and low resolution (R~1400) spectroscopy of three bright cluster red giants in the K atmospheric window. We derived the metal abundance by analysis of these spectra and from the slope of the RGB. The cluster is deeply embedded in dust and undergoes a mean reddening of Av~24.8+-3 mag. The distance to the object is D=4.6+-0.7kpc. The metal abundance of G02 is [Fe/H](H96)=-0.33+-0.14 and [Fe/H](CG)=-0.16+-0.12 using different scales. The best fit to the radial surface brightness profile with a single-mass King's model yields a core radius rc=0.70 arcmin (0.9pc), tidal radius rt=15 arcmin (20pc), and central oncentration c=1.33. We demonstrate that G02 is new Milky Way globular cluster, among the most metal rich globular clusters in the Galaxy. The object is physically located at the inner edge of the thin disk and the transition region with the bulge, and also falls in the zone of the "missing" globulars toward the central region of the Milky Way. 
0808.01566	Structural, Vibrational and Thermodynamic Properties of AgnCu34-n Nanoparticles	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Handan Yildirim, Abdelkader Kara, Talat. S Rahman	Abstract:  We report results of a systematic study of structural, vibrational and thermodynamical properties of 34-atom bimetallic nanoparticles from the AgnCu34-n family using model interaction potentials as derived from the embedded atom method and in the harmonic approximation of lattice dynamics. Systematic trends in the bond length and dynamical properties can be explained largely on arguments based on local coordination and elemental environment. Thus increase in the number of silver atoms in a given neighborhood introduces a monotonic increase in bond length while increase of the copper content does the reverse. Moreover, based on bond lengths of the lowest coordinated (6 and 8) copper atoms with their nearest neighbors (Cu atoms), we find that the nanoparticles divide into two groups with average bond length either close to (~ 2.58 A) or smaller (~ 2.48 A) than that in bulk copper, accompanied by characteristic features in their vibrational density of states. For the entire set of nanoparticles, vibrational modes are found above the bulk bands of copper/silver. Furthermore, a blue shift in the high frequency end with increasing number of copper atoms in the nanoparticles is traced to a shrinkage of bond lengths from bulk values. The vibrational densities of states at the low frequency end of the spectrum scale linearly with frequency as for single element nanoparticles, however, the effect is more pronounced for these nanoalloys. The Debye temperature was found to be about one third of that of the bulk for pure copper and silver nanoparticles with a non-linear increase with increasing number of copper atoms in the nanoalloys. 
0808.01567	Sivers Asymmetries for Inclusive Pion and Kaon Production in Deep-Inelastic Scattering	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:John Ellis, Dae Sung Hwang, Aram Kotzinian	Abstract:  We calculate the Sivers distribution functions induced by the final-state interaction due to one-gluon exchange in diquark models of nucleon structure, treating the cases of scalar and axial-vector diquarks with both dipole and Gaussian form factors. We use these distribution functions to calculate the Sivers single-spin asymmetries for inclusive pion and kaon production in deep-inelastic scattering. We compare our calculations with the results of HERMES and COMPASS, finding good agreement for pi+ production at HERMES, and qualitative agreement for pi0 and K+ production. Our predictions for pion and kaon production at COMPASS could be probed with increased statistics. The successful comparison of our calculations with the HERMES data constitutes prima facie evidence that the quarks in the nucleon have some orbital angular momentum in the infinite-momentum frame. 
0808.01568	Spacings and pair correlations for finite Bernoulli convolutions	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Itai Benjamini, Boris Solomyak	Abstract:  We consider finite Bernoulli convolutions with a parameter $1/2 < r < 1$ supported on a discrete point set, generically of size $2^N$. These sequences are uniformly distributed with respect to the infinite Bernoulli convolution measure $ν_r$, as $N$ tends to infinity. Numerical evidence suggests that for a generic $r$, the distribution of spacings between appropriately rescaled points is Poissonian. We obtain some partial results in this direction; for instance, we show that, on average, the pair correlations do not exhibit attraction or repulsion in the limit. On the other hand, for certain algebraic $r$ the behavior is totally different. 
0808.01569	Semi-Flatland	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:David Vegh, John McGreevy	Abstract:  We study perturbative compactifications of Type II string theory that rely on a fibration structure of the extra dimensions a la SYZ. Non-geometric spaces are obtained by using T-dualities as monodromies. These vacua generically preserve N=1 supersymmetry in four dimensions, and are U-dual to M-theory on G2 manifolds. Several examples are discussed, some of which admit an asymmetric orbifold description. The massless spectrum is matched to that of the dual M-theory compactification on a Joyce manifold when a comparison is possible. We explore the possibility of twisted reductions where left-moving spacetime fermion number Wilson lines are turned on in the fiber. We also give an explanation from this semiflat viewpoint for the Hanany-Witten brane-creation effect and for the equivalence of the Type IIA orientifold on T5/Z2 and Type IIB on S1 x K3. 
0808.01570	Superhorizon Perturbations and the Cosmic Microwave Background	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Adrienne L. Erickcek, Sean M. Carroll, Marc Kamionkowski (Caltech)    	Abstract:  Superhorizon perturbations induce large-scale temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) via the Grishchuk-Zel'dovich effect. We analyze the CMB temperature anisotropies generated by a single-mode adiabatic superhorizon perturbation. We show that an adiabatic superhorizon perturbation in a LCDM universe does not generate a CMB temperature dipole, and we derive constraints to the amplitude and wavelength of a superhorizon potential perturbation from measurements of the CMB quadrupole and octupole. We also consider constraints to a superhorizon fluctuation in the curvaton field, which was recently proposed as a source of the hemispherical power asymmetry in the CMB. 
0808.01571	Gauge Mediation in F-Theory GUT Models	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Joseph Marsano, Natalia Saulina, Sakura Schafer-Nameki	Abstract:  We study a simple framework for gauge-mediated supersymmetry-breaking in local GUT models based on F-theory 7-branes and demonstrate that a mechanism for solving both the μand μ/B_μ problems emerges in a natural way. In particular, a straightforward coupling of the messengers to the Higgs sector leads to a geometry which not only provides us with an approximate U(1)_{PQ} symmetry that forbids the generation of μat the GUT scale, it also forces the SUSY-breaking spurion field to carry a nontrivial PQ charge. This connects the breaking of SUSY to the generation of μso that the same scale enters both. Moreover, the messenger sector naturally realizes the D3-instanton triggered Polonyi model of arXiv:0808.1286 so this scale is exponentially suppressed relative to M_{GUT}. The effective action at low scales is in fact precisely of the form of the "sweet spot supersymmetry" scenario studied by Ibe and Kitano in arXiv:0705.3686. 
0808.01572	Circles-in-the-sky searches and observable cosmic topology in the inflationary limit	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:B. Mota, M.J. Reboucas, R. Tavakol	Abstract:  While the topology of the Universe is at present not specified by any known fundamental theory, it may in principle be determined through observations. In particular, a non-trivial topology will generate pairs of matching circles of temperature fluctuations in maps of the cosmic microwave background, the so-called circles-in-the-sky. A general search for such pairs of circles would be extremely costly and would therefore need to be confined to restricted parameter ranges. To draw quantitative conclusions from the negative results of such partial searches for the existence of circles we need a concrete theoretical framework. Here we provide such a framework by obtaining constraints on the angular parameters of these circles as a function of cosmological density parameters and the observer's position. As an example of the application of our results, we consider the recent search restricted to pairs of nearly back-to-back circles with negative results. We show that assuming the Universe to be very nearly flat, with its total matter-energy density satisfying the bounds $ 0 <|Ω_0 - 1| \lesssim 10^{-5}$, compatible with the predictions of typical inflationary models, this search, if confirmed, could in principle be sufficient to exclude a detectable non-trivial cosmic topology for most observers. We further relate explicitly the fraction of observers for which this result holds to the cosmological density parameters. 
0808.01573	Systematic Analysis of Frustration Effects in Anisotropic Checkerboard Lattice Hubbard Model	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Takuya Yoshioka, Akihisa Koga, Norio Kawakami	Abstract:  We study the ground state properties of the geometrically frustrated Hubbard model on the anisotropic checkerboard lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping $t$ and next nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$. By using the path-integral renormalization group method, we study the phase diagram in the parameter space of the Hubbard interaction $U$ and the frustration-control parameter $t'/t$. Close examinations of the effective hopping, the double occupancy, the momentum distribution and the spin/charge correlation functions allow us to determine the phase diagram at zero temperature, where the plaquette-singlet insulator emerges besides the antiferromagnetic insulator and the paramagnetic metal. Spin-liquid insulating states without any kind of symmetry breaking cannot be found in our frustrated model. 
0808.01574	The Evolution of Late-Time Optical Emission From SN 1979C	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:D. Milisavljevic, R. Fesen, R. Kirshner, P. Challis	Abstract:  Optical spectra of the bright Type II-L supernova SN 1979C obtained in April 2008 with the 6.5 m MMT telescope are compared with archival late-time spectra to follow the evolution of its optical emission over the age range of 11 to 29 years. We estimate an Halpha flux decrease of around 35% from 1993 to 2008 but noticeable increases in the strength of blueshifted emission of forbidden oxygen lines. While the maximum expansion of the broad ~6700 km/s Halpha emission appears largely unchanged from 1993, we find a significant narrowing of the double-peaked emission profiles in the [O I] 6300, 6364 and [O II] 7319, 7330 lines. A comparison of late-time optical spectra of a few other Type II supernovae which, like SN 1979C, exhibit bright late-time X-ray, optical, and radio emissions, suggests that blueshifted double-peaked oxygen emission profiles may be a common phenomenon. Finally, detection of a faint, broad emission bump centered around 5800 Angstroms suggests the presence of WC type Wolf-Rayet stars in the supernova's host star cluster. 
0808.01575	Discovery of a Wide Substellar Companion to a Nearby Low-Mass Star	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jacqueline Radigan, David Lafrenière, Ray Jayawardhana, René Doyon	Abstract:  We report the discovery of a wide (135+/-25 AU), unusually blue L5 companion 2MASS J17114559+4028578 to the nearby M4.5 dwarf G 203-50 as a result of a targeted search for common proper motion pairs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Two Micron All Sky Survey. Adaptive Optics imaging with Subaru indicates that neither component is a nearly equal mass binary with separation > 0.18", and places limits on the existence of additional faint companions. An examination of TiO and CaH features in the primary's spectrum is consistent with solar metallicity and provides no evidence that G 203-50 is metal poor. We estimate an age for the primary of 1-5 Gyr based on activity. Assuming coevality of the companion, its age, gravity and metallicity can be constrained from properties of the primary, making it a suitable benchmark object for the calibration of evolutionary models and for determining the atmospheric properties of peculiar blue L dwarfs. The low total mass (M_tot=0.21+/-0.03 M_sun), intermediate mass ratio (q=0.45+/-0.14), and wide separation of this system demonstrate that the star formation process is capable of forming wide, weakly bound binary systems with low mass and BD components. Based on the sensitivity of our search we find that no more than 2.2% of early-to-mid M dwarfs (9.0 < M_V < 13.0) have wide substellar companions with m > 0.06 M_sun. 
0808.01576	The equilibrium intrinsic crystal-liquid interface of colloids	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Jessica Hernández-Guzmán, Eric R. Weeks	Abstract:  We use confocal microscopy to study an equilibrated crystal-liquid interface in a colloidal suspension. Capillary waves roughen the surface, but locally the intrinsic interface is sharply defined. We use local measurements of the structure and dynamics to characterize the intrinsic interface, and different measurements find slightly different widths of this interface. In terms of the particle diameter $d$, this width is either $1.5d$ (based on structural information) or $2.4d$ (based on dynamics), both not much larger than the particle size. This work is the first direct experimental visualization of an equilibrated crystal-liquid interface. 
0808.01577	Electrostatic deposition of graphene in a gaseous environment: A deterministic route to synthesize rolled graphenes?	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Anton Sidorov, David Mudd, Gamini Sumanasekera, P. J. Ouseph, C. S. Jayanthi, Shi-Yu Wu*	Abstract:  The synthesis of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) of desired diameters and chiralities is critical to the design of nanoscale electronic devices with desired properties.1-6 The existing methods are based on self-assembly, 7-16 therefore lacking the control over their diameters and chiralities. The present work reports a direct route to roll graphene. Specifically, we found that the electrostatic deposition of graphene yielded: (i) flat graphene layers under high vacuum (10-7 Torr), (ii) completely scrolled graphene under hydrogen atmosphere, (iii) partially scrolled graphene under nitrogen atmosphere, and (iv) no scrolling for helium atmospheres. Our study shows that the application of the electrostatic field facilitates the rolling of graphene sheets exposed to appropriate gases and allows the rolling of any size graphene. The technique proposed here, in conjunction with a technique that produces graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) of uniform widths, will have significant impact on the development of carbon nanotube based devices. Furthermore, the present technique may be applied to obtain tubes/scrolls of other layered materials. 
0808.01578	On the Phase Diagram of Spin-Polarized Attractive Hubbard Model: Weak Coupling Limit	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Agnieszka Kujawa, Roman Micnas	Abstract:  The superfluid properties of the attractive Hubbard model in a Zeeman magnetic field, and in the weak coupling regime have been investigated. The temperature and magnetic field dependencies of the order parameter have been analyzed. Furthermore, the temperature vs. magnetic field and temperature vs. spin polarization phase diagrams for the 2D and 3D lattices have been obtained. For some parameters a reentrant transition has been found. 
0808.01579	Transverse Commensurability Effect for Vortices in Periodic Pinning Arrays	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:C. Reichhardt, C.J. Olson Reichhardt	Abstract:  Using computer simulations, we demonstrate a new type of commensurability that occurs for vortices moving longitudinally through periodic pinning arrays in the presence of an additional transverse driving force. As a function of vortex density, there is a series of broad maxima in the transverse critical depinning force that do not fall at the matching fields where the number of vortices equals an integer multiple of the number of pinning sites. The commensurability effects are associated with dynamical states in which evenly spaced structures consisting of one or more moving rows of vortices form between rows of pinning sites. Remarkably, the critical transverse depinning force can be more than an order of magnitude larger than the longitudinal depinning force. 
0808.01580	Varying-Alpha Cosmologies with Potentials	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:John D. Barrow, Baojiu Li	Abstract:  We generalize the Bekenstein-Sandvik-Barrow-Magueijo (BSBM) model for the variation of the fine structure 'constant', $α,$ to include an exponential or inverse power-law self-potential for the scalar field $% φ$ which drives the time variation of $α$, and consider the dynamics of $φ$ in such models. We find solutions for the evolution of $φ$ or $α$ in matter-, radiation- and dark-energy-dominated cosmic eras. In general, the evolution of $φ$ is well determined solely by either the self-potential or the coupling to matter, depending on the model parameters. The results are general and applicable to other models where the evolution of a scalar field is governed by a matter coupling and a self-potential. We find that the existing astronomical data stringently constrains the possible evolution of $α$ between redshifts $z\simeq 1-3.5$ and the present, and this leads to very strong limit on the allowed deviation of the potential from that of a pure cosmological constant.

0808.01583	SDiff Gauge Theory and the M2 Condensate	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Igor A. Bandos, Paul K. Townsend	Abstract:  We develop a general formalism for the construction, in $D$-dimensional Minkowski space, of gauge theories for which the gauge group is the infinite-dimensional group SDiff$_n$ of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of some closed $n$-dimensional manifold. We then focus on the D=3 SDiff$_3$ superconformal gauge theory describing a condensate of M2-branes; in particular, we derive its ${\cal N}=8$ superfield equations from a pure-spinor superspace action, and we describe its relationship to the D=3 SDiff$_2$ super-Yang-Mills theory describing a condensate of D2-branes. 
0808.01584	Link invariants from finite Coxeter racks	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Sam Nelson, Ryan Wieghard	Abstract:  We study Coxeter racks over $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and the knot and link invariants they define. We exploit the module structure of these racks to enhance the rack counting invariants and give examples showing that these enhanced invariants are stronger than the unenhanced rack counting invariants. 
0808.01585	Homological Dimensions in Cotorsion Pairs	Rings and Algebras (math.RA)	Authors:Lidia Angeleri Hugel, Octavio Mendoza Hernandez	Abstract:  Two classes $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ of modules over a ring $R$ are said to form a cotorsion pair $(\mathcal A, \mathcal B)$ if $\mathcal A={\rm Ker Ext}^1_R(-,\mathcal B)$ and $\mathcal B={\rm Ker Ext}^1_R(\mathcal A,-)$. We investigate relative homological dimensions in cotorsion pairs. This can be applied to study the big and the little finitistic dimension of $R$. We show that $\Findim R<\infty$ if and only if the following dimensions are finite for some cotorsion pair $(\mathcal A, \mathcal B)$ in $\mathrm{Mod} R$: the relative projective dimension of $\A$ with respect to itself, and the $\mathcal A$-resolution dimension of the category $\mathcal P$ of all $R$-modules of finite projective dimension. Moreover, we obtain an analogous result for $\findim R$, and we characterize when $\Findim R=\findim R.$ 
0808.01586	Glassy states in fermionic systems with strong disorder and interactions	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:David J. Schwab, Sudip Chakravarty	Abstract:  We study the competition between interactions and disorder in two dimensions. Whereas a noninteracting system is always Anderson localized by disorder in two dimensions, a pure system can develop a Mott gap for sufficiently strong interactions. Within a simple model, with short-ranged repulsive interactions, we show that, even in the limit of strong interaction, the Mott gap is completely washed out by disorder for an infinite system for dimensions $D\le 2$. The probability of a nonzero gap falls onto a universal curve, leading to a glassy state for which we provide a scaling function for the frequency dependent susceptibility. 
0808.01587	The structure of electronic polarization and its strain dependence	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Yanpeng Yao, Huaxiang Fu	Abstract:  The $φ(\kpp)\sim \kpp$ relation is called polarization structure. By density functional calculations, we study the polarization structure in ferroelectric perovskite PbTiO$_3$, revealing (1) the $\kpp$ point that contributes most to the electronic polarization, (2) the magnitude of bandwidth, and (3) subtle curvature of polarization dispersion. We also investigate how polarization structure in PbTiO$_3$ is modified by compressive inplane strains. The bandwidth of polarization dispersion in PbTiO$_3$ is shown to exhibit an unusual decline, though the total polarization is enhanced. As another outcome of this study, we formulate an analytical scheme for the purpose of identifying what determine the polarization structure at arbitrary $\kpp$ points by means of Wannier functions. We find that $φ(\kpp)$ is determined by two competing factors: one is the overlaps between neighboring Wannier functions within the plane {\it perpendicular} to the polarization direction, and the other is the localization length {\it parallel} to the polarization direction. Inplane strain increases the former while decreases the latter, causing interesting non-monotonous effects on polarization structure. Finally, polarization dispersion in another paradigm ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ is discussed and compared with that of PbTiO$_3$. 
0808.01588	A Generalized Publication Bias Model	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:Peter H. Schonemann, Jeffrey D. Scargle	Abstract:  Scargle (2000) has discussed Rosenthal and Rubin's (1978) "fail-safe number" (FSN) method for estimating the number of unpublished studies in meta-analysis. He concluded that this FSN cannot possibly be correct because a central assumption the authors used conflicts with the very definition of publication bias. While this point has been made by others before (Elsahoff, 1978; Darlington, 1980; Thomas, 1985, Iyengar & Greenhouse, 1988), Scargle showed, by way of a simple 2-parameter model, how far off Rosenthal & Rubin' s estimate can be in practice. However, his results relied on the assumption that the decision variable is normally distributed with zero mean. In this case the ratio of unpublished to published papers is large only in a tiny region of the parameter plane. Building on these results, we now show that (1) Replacing densities with probability masses greatly simplifies Scargle's derivations and permits an explicit statement of the relation between the probability alpha of Type I errors and the step-size beta; (2) This result does not require any distribution assumptions; (3) The distinction between 1-sided and 2-sided rejection regions becomes immaterial; (4) This distribution-free approach leads to an immediate generalization to partitions involving more than two intervals, and thus covers more general selection functions. 
0808.01589	On the average growth exponent for beta-expansions	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Nikita Sidorov	Abstract:  Let $\be\in(1,2)$. Each $x\in I_\be:=[0,\frac{1}{\be-1}]$ can be represented in the form \[ x=\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k\be^{-k}, \] where $a_k\in\{0,1\}$ for all $k$ (a $\be$-expansion of $x$). It was shown in \cite{S} that a.e. $x\in I_\be$ has a continuum of distinct $\be$-expansions. In this paper we show that for a generic $x$, this continuum has one and the same growth rate, i.e., the general $\be$-expansions exhibit an ergodic behaviour. When $\be<\frac{1+\sqrt5}2$, we show that the set of $\be$-expansions grows exponentially for every $x\in(0,\frac{1}{\be-1})$. Special attention is paid to the case $\be=\frac{1+\sqrt5}2$, for which we explicitly compute the average growth exponent and apply this result to evaluating the local dimension of the corresponding Bernoulli convolution at a Lebesgue-generic $x$. 
0808.01590	The Network Species Model	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:David Kizirian, Maureen A. Donnelly	Abstract:  We propose a theoretical model for species that is focused on intrinsic organization and processes. Specifically, we regard species to be networks of organisms integrated by reproductive mechanisms (e.g., conjugation, meiosis, syngamy) regardless of degree or type of divergence, longevity, size, fate, or other criteria. Ramifications of viewing units of diversity in terms of inherent organization include the following: (1) Species, subspecies, population, deme, Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU), and related terms cannot be distinguished on the basis of inherent organization and, consequently, do not reflect a hierarchy of organization. In other words, only one model is required to explain systems composed of organisms. (2) Temporarily isolated networks of organisms possess the same intrinsic organization and, therefore, the same ontological status as permanently isolated systems. (3) Units of diversity are recognized regardless of kind or degree of divergence. (4) Fate is not an intrinsic property of systems and is an inappropriate consideration in species models. (5) Networks are recognized at the moment they become isolated; therefore, resultant classifications reflect the causal events that generate diversity (e.g., vicariance) rather than post-vicariance events such as character evolution and, consequently, have greater historical relevance (e.g., biogeography). (6) Because the proposed model is based on organization, it is similar to models in other disciplines (e.g., astronomy, chemistry, and physics) and should lead to greater unification of thought within biology and among scientific disciplines. (7) Lineage concepts are problematic because they do not describe a unique level of biological organization and because ancestor-descendant relationships are not unique to living systems. 
0808.01591	A scalable, high-speed measurement-based quantum computer using trapped ions	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:R. Stock, D. F. V. James	Abstract:  We describe a scalable, high-speed, and robust architecture for measurement-based quantum-computing with trapped ions. Measurement-based architectures offer a way to speed-up operation of a quantum computer significantly by parallelizing the slow entangling operations and transferring the speed requirement to fast measurement of qubits. We show that a 3D cluster state suitable for fault-tolerant measurement-based quantum computing can be implemented on a 2D array of ion traps. We propose the projective measurement of ions via multi-photon photoionization for nanosecond operation and discuss the viability of such a scheme for Ca ions. 
0808.01592	The sharp energy-capacity inequality	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Michael Usher	Abstract:  Using the Oh-Schwarz spectral invariants and some arguments of Frauenfelder, Ginzburg, and Schlenk, we show that the π_1-sensitive Hofer-Zehnder capacity of any subset of a closed symplectic manifold is less than or equal to its displacement energy. This estimate is sharp, and implies some new extensions of the Non-Squeezing Theorem. 
0808.01593	High-energy Particle Acceleration and Production of Ultra-high-energy Cosmic Rays in the Giant Lobes of Centaurus A	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M.J. Hardcastle, C.C. Cheung, I.J. Feain, L. Stawarz	Abstract:  The nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A is poorly studied at high frequencies with conventional radio telescopes because of its very large angular size, but is one of a very few extragalactic objects to be detected and resolved by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). We have used the five-year WMAP data for Cen A to constrain the high-frequency radio spectra of the 10-degree giant lobes and to search for spectral changes as a function of position along the lobes. We show that the high-frequency radio spectra of the northern and southern giant lobes are significantly different: the spectrum of the southern lobe steepens monotonically (and is steeper further from the active nucleus) whereas the spectrum of the northern lobe remains consistent with a power law. The inferred differences in the northern and southern giant lobes may be the result of real differences in their high-energy particle acceleration histories, perhaps due to the influence of the northern middle lobe, an intermediate-scale feature which has no detectable southern counterpart. In light of these results, we discuss the prospects for Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detections of inverse-Compton emission from the giant lobes and the lobes' possible role in the production of the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory. We show that the possibility of a Fermi detection depends sensitively on the physical conditions in the giant lobes, with the northern lobe more likely to be detected, and that any emission observed by Fermi is likely to be dominated by photons at the soft end of the Fermi energy band. On the other hand we argue that the estimated conditions in the giant lobes imply that UHECRs can be accelerated there, with a potentially detectable gamma-ray signature at TeV energies. 
0808.01594	Extremely high precision VLBI astrometry of PSR J0437-4715 and implications for theories of gravity	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. T. Deller, J.P.W. Verbiest, S.J. Tingay, M. Bailes	Abstract:  Using the recently upgraded Long Baseline Array, we have measured the trigonometric parallax of PSR J0437-4715 to better than 1% precision, the most precise pulsar distance determination made to date. Comparing this VLBI distance measurement to the kinematic distance obtained from pulsar timing, which is calculated from the pulsar's proper motion and apparent rate of change of orbital period, gives a precise limit on the unmodeled relative acceleration between the Solar System and PSR J0437-4715, which can be used in a variety of applications. Firstly, it shows that Newton's gravitational constant G is stable with time (\dot{G}/G = (-5 +- 26) x 10^{-13} yr^{-1}, 95% confidence). Secondly, if a stochastic gravitational wave background existed at the currently quoted limit, this null result would fail ~50% of the time. Thirdly, it excludes Jupiter-mass planets within 226 AU of the Sun in 50% of the sky (95% confidence). Finally, the ~1% agreement of the parallax and orbital period derivative distances provides a fundamental confirmation of the parallax distance method upon which all astronomical distances are based. 
0808.01595	Decoding the Mechanism for the Origin of Dark Matter in the Early Universe Using LHC Data	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Daniel Feldman, Zuowei Liu, Pran Nath	Abstract:  It is shown that LHC data can allow one to decode the mechanism by which dark matter is generated in the early universe in supersymmetric theories. We focus on two of the major mechanisms for such generation of dark matter which are known to be the Stau Coannihilation (Stau-Co) where the neutralino is typically Bino like and annihilation on the Hyperbolic Branch (HB) where the neutralino has a significant Higgsino component. An investigation of how one may discriminate between the Stau-Co region and the HB region using LHC data is given for the mSUGRA model. The analysis utilizes several signatures including multi leptons, hadronic jets, b-tagging, and missing transverse momentum. A study of the SUSY signatures reveals several correlated smoking gun signals allowing a clear discrimination between the Stau-Co and the HB regions where dark matter in the early universe can originate. 
0808.01596	A Detailed Analytic Study of the Asymptotic Quasinormal Modes of Schwarzschild-Anti De Sitter Black Holes	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Ramin G. Daghigh, Michael D. Green	Abstract:  We analyze analytically the asymptotic regions of the quasinormal mode frequency spectra with infinitely large overtone numbers for $D$-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes in anti de Sitter spacetimes. In this limit, we confirm the analytic results obtained previously in the literature using different methods. In addition, we show that in certain spacetime dimensions these techniques imply the existence of other regions of the asymptotic quasinormal mode frequency spectrum which have not previously appeared in the literature. For large black holes, some of these modes have a damping rate of $1.2T_H$, where $T_H$ is the Hawking temperature. This is less than the damping rate of the lowest overtone quasinormal mode calculated by other authors. It is not completely clear whether these modes actually exist or are an artifact of an unknown flaw in the analytic techniques being used. We discuss the possibility of the existence of these modes and explore some of the consequences. We also examine the possible connection between the asymptotic quasinormal modes of Schwarzschild-anti de Sitter black holes and the quantum level spacing of their horizon area spectrum. 
0808.01597	Vacuum static compactified wormholes in eight-dimensional Lovelock theory	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Fabrizio Canfora, Alex Giacomini	Abstract:  In this paper new exact solutions in eight dimensional Lovelock theory will be presented. These solutions are vacuum static wormhole, black hole and generalized Bertotti-Robinson space-times with nontrivial torsion. All the solutions have a cross product structure of the type $M_{5}\times Σ_{3} $ where $M_{5}$ is a five dimensional manifold and $Σ_{3}$ a compact constant curvature manifold. The wormhole is the first example of a smooth vacuum static Lovelock wormhole which is neither Chern-Simons nor Born-Infeld. It will be also discussed how the presence of torsion affects the "navigableness" of the wormhole for scalar and spinning particles. It will be shown that the wormhole with torsion may act as "geometrical filter": a very large torsion may "increase the traversability" for scalars while acting as a "polarizator" on spinning particles. This may have interesting phenomenological consequences. 
0808.01598	Precision Southern Hemisphere pulsar VLBI astrometry: techniques and results for PSR J1559-4438	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A.T. Deller, S.J. Tingay, W. Brisken	Abstract:  We describe a data reduction pipeline for VLBI astrometric observations of pulsars, implemented using the ParselTongue AIPS interface. The pipeline performs calibration (including ionosphere modeling), phase referencing with proper accounting of reference source structure, amplitude corrections for pulsar scintillation, and position fitting to yield the position, proper motion and parallax. The optimal data weighting scheme to minimize the total error budget of a parallax fit, and how this scheme varies with pulsar parameters such as flux density, is also investigated. The robustness of the techniques employed are demonstrated with the presentation of the first results from a two year astrometry program using the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA). The parallax of PSR J1559-4438 is determined to be 0.384 +- 0.081 mas (1 sigma), resulting in a distance estimate of 2600 pc which is consistent with earlier DM and HI absorption estimates. 
0808.01599	Finding cores of random 2-SAT formulae via Poisson cloning	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Jeong Han Kim	Abstract:  For the random 2-SAT formula $F(n,p)$, let $F_C (n,p)$ be the formula left after the pure literal algorithm applied to $F(n,p)$ stops. Using the recently developed Poisson cloning model together with the cut-off line algorithm (COLA), we completely analyze the structure of $F_{C} (n,p)$. In particular, it is shown that, for $\gl:= p(2n-1) = 1+\gs $ with $\gs\gg n^{-1/3}$, the core of $F(n,p)$ has $\thl^2 n +O((\thl n)^{1/2})$ variables and $\thl^2 \gl n+O((\thl n))^{1/2}$ clauses, with high probability, where $\thl$ is the larger solution of the equation $þ- (1-e^{-\thl \gl})=0$. We also estimate the probability of $F(n,p)$ being satisfiable to obtain $$ \pr[ F_2(n, \sfrac{\gl}{2n-1}) is satisfiable ] = \caseth{1-\frac{1+o(1)}{16\gs^3 n}}{if $\gl= 1-\gs$ with $\gs\gg n^{-1/3}$}{}{}{e^{-Θ(\gs^3n)}}{if $\gl=1+\gs$ with $\gs\gg n^{-1/3}$,} $$ where $o(1)$ goes to 0 as $\gs$ goes to 0. This improves the bounds of Bollobás et al. \cite{BBCKW}. 
0808.01600	Exactness in the Path Integral of the Coulomb Potential in One Space Dimension	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Seiji Sakoda	Abstract:  We solve time-sliced path integrals of one-dimensional Coulomb system in an exact manner. In formulating path integrals, we make use of the Duru-Kleinert transformation with Fujikawa's gauge theoretical technique. Feynman kernels in the momentum representation both for bound states and scattering states will be obtained with clear pole structure that explains the exactness of the path integral. The path integrals presented here can be, therefore, evaluated exactly by making use of Cauchy's integral theorem. 
0808.01601	Second order hydrodynamics of a CFT plasma from boost invariant expansion	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Alex Buchel, Miguel Paulos	Abstract:  We compute finite coupling correction to a nonlinear second order hydrodynamic coefficient in the boost invariant expansion of the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. The result is universal for a large class of strongly coupled four dimensional conformal gauge theories. 
0808.01602	Proposal for a geophysical search for dilatonic waves	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Sachie Shiomi	Abstract:  We propose a new method of searching for the composition-dependent dilatonic waves, predicted by unified theories of strings. In this method, Earth's surface-gravity changes due to translational motions of its inner core, excited by dilatonic waves, are searched for by using superconducting gravimeters. This method has its best sensitivity at the frequency of $\sim$ 7 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ Hz, which is lower than the sensitive frequencies of previous proposals using gravitational-wave detectors: $\sim$ 10 to 1000 Hz. Using available results of surface-gravity measurements with superconducting gravimeters and assuming a simple Earth model, we present preliminary upper limits on the energy density of a stochastic background of massless dilatons at the low frequency. Though the results are currently limited by the uncertainty in the Earth model, this method has a potential of detecting dilatonic waves in a new window. 
0808.01603	Correlation potential and ladder diagrams	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:V. A. Dzuba	Abstract:  The all-order correlation potential method of accurate atomic structure calculations for atoms with one external electron is extended to include one more class of correlation diagrams to all orders. These are the so-called ladder diagrams which describe residual Coulomb interaction between an external electron and atomic core. This is in addition to the screening of Coulomb interaction by core electrons and the hole-particle interaction in the core polarization operator which are also included in all orders. Calculations of the energies of the lowest $s$, $p$ and $d$ states of cesium and thallium show that inclusion of the ladder diagrams leads to significant improvement of the accuracy of the calculations. The discrepancy between theoretical and experimental energies is reduced to a small fraction of a per cent in all cases. This widens the range of atoms and atomic states for which the correlation potential method can produce very accurate results. 
0808.01604	A fusion of the LAPW and the LMTO methods: the augmented plane wave plus muffin-tin orbital (PMT) method	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Takao Kotani, Mark van Schilfgaarde	Abstract:  We present a new full-potential method to solve the one-body problem, for example, in the local density approximation. The method uses the augmented plane waves (APWs) and the generalized muffin-tin orbitals (MTOs) together as basis sets to represent the eigenfunctions. Since the MTOs can efficiently describe localized orbitals, e.g, transition metal 3$d$ orbitals, the total energy convergence with basis size is drastically improved in comparison with the linearized APW method. Required parameters to specify MTOs are given by atomic calculations in advance. Thus the robustness, reliability, easy-of-use, and efficiency at this method can be superior to the linearized APW and MTO methods. We show how it works in typical examples, Cu, Fe, Li, SrTiO$_3$, and GaAs. 
0808.01605	Addressing the Multi-Channel Inverse Problem at High Energy Colliders: A Model Independent Approach to the Search for New Physics with Trileptons	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Sourabh Dube, Julian Glatzer, Sunil Somalwar, Alexander Sood, Scott Thomas	Abstract:  We describe a method for interpreting trilepton searches at high energy colliders in a model-independent fashion and apply it to the recent searches at the Tevatron. The key step is to recognize that the trilepton signature is comprised of four experimentally very different channels defined by the number of tau-leptons in the trilepton state. Contributions from these multiple channels to the overall experimental sensitivity (cross section times branching ratio) are model-independent and can be parametrized in terms of relevant new particle masses. Given the trileptonic branching ratios of a specific model, these experimentally obtained multichannel sensitivities can be combined to obtain a cross section measurement that can be used to confront the model with data. Our model-independent results are more widely applicable than the current Tevatron trilepton results which are stated exclusively in terms of mSUGRA parameters of supersymmetry. The technique presented here can be expanded beyond trilepton searches to the more general "inverse problem" of experimentally discriminating between competing models that seek to explain new physics discovered in multiple channels. 
0808.01606	A Study of the Cyclotron Gas-Stopping Concept for the Production of Rare Isotope Beams	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:M. Sternberg (1 and 2), G. Savard (1 and 2) ((1) Argonne National Laboratory, (2) University of Chicago)    	Abstract:  The proposed cyclotron gas-stopping scheme for the efficient thermalization of intense rare isotope beams is examined. Simulations expand on previous studies and expose many complications of such an apparatus arising from physical effects not accounted for properly in previous work. The previously proposed cyclotron gas-stopper geometry is found to have a near null efficiency, but extended simulations suggest that a device with a much larger pole gap could achieve a stopping efficiency approaching roughly 90% and at least a 10 times larger acceptance. However, some of the advantages that were incorrectly predicted in previous simulations for high intensity operation of this device are compromised. 
0808.01607	Experimental studies of the internal Goos-Hanchen shift for self-collimated beams in two-dimensional microwave photonic crystals	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Aaron Matthews, Yuri Kivshar	Abstract:  We study experimentally the Goos-Hanchen effect observed at the reflection of a self-collimated beam from the surface of a two-dimensional photonic crystal and describe a method for controlling the beam reflection through surface engineering. The microwave photonic crystal, fabricated from alumina rods, allows control of the output position of a reflected beam undergoing an internal Goos-Hanchen shift by changing the rod diameter at the reflection surface. The experimental data is in good agreement with the results of the finite-difference time-domain numerical calculations. 
0808.01608	Charmed baryon in a Diquark model	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Q. W. Wang	Abstract:  A diquark model is used to investigate single charmed baryons. In this model, baryon is composed of two diquarks and an antiquark. Masses of lowest lying states with $J^P= 1/2 ^ \pm$ are obtained. Some masses are smaller than other theoretic predictions which indicates that these baryons of pentaquark structure could be relatively stable. The results also show that $Λ(2882)$ may be a pentaquark with $J^P=1/2^-$ and $Ξ(3125)$ may be a pentaquark with $J^P=1/2^+$. 
0808.01609	A Tale of Three Kernels	Complex Variables (math.CV)	Authors:Steven G. Krantz	Abstract:  We consider the Bergman, Szegő, and Poisson Szegő kernels on a domain in $\CC$ or $\CC^n$. Various properties and relationships are established. The paper has both an expository component and a research component. 
0808.01610	Quantum chaotic systems with arbitrarily large Ehrenfest times	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Maciej Kuna	Abstract:  A class of time independent and physically meaningful Hamiltonians leads to evolution of observable quantities whose Ehrenfest times are arbitrarily large. This fact contradicts the popular claim that the true chaos is in quantum mechanics excluded by first principles. 
0808.01611	Filaments in Galactic Winds Driven by Young Stellar Clusters	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ary Rodriguez-Gonzalez, Alejandro Esquivel, Pablo Velazquez, Alejandro Raga, Veronica Melo	Abstract:  The starburst galaxy M82 shows a system of H$α$-emitting filaments which extend to each side of the galactic disk. We model these filaments as the result of the interaction between the winds from a distribution of Super Stellar Clusters (SSCs). We first derive the condition necessary for producing a radiative interaction between the cluster winds (a condition which is met by the SSC distribution of M82). We then compute 3D simulations for SSC wind distributions which satisfy the condition for a radiative interaction, and also for distributions which do not satisfy this condition. We find that the highly radiative models, that result from the interaction of high metallicity cluster winds, produce a structure of H$α$ emitting filaments, which qualitatively agrees with the observations of the M82, while the non-radiative SSC wind interaction models do not produce filamentary structures. Therefore, our criterion for radiative interactions (which depends on the mass loss rate and the terminal velocity of the SSC winds, and the mean separation between SSCs) can be used to predict whether or not an observed galaxy should have associated H$α$ emitting filaments. 
0808.01612	Detecting groups of similar components in complex networks	Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)	Authors:J. Wang, C.-H. Lai	Abstract:  We study how to detect groups in a complex network each of which consists of component nodes sharing a similar connection pattern. Based on the mixture models and the exploratory analysis set up by Newman and Leicht (Newman and Leicht 2007 {\it Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA} {\bf 104} 9564), we develop an algorithm that is applicable to a network with any degree distribution. The partition of a network suggested by this algorithm also applies to its complementary network. In general, groups of similar components are not necessarily identical with the communities in a community network; thus partitioning a network into groups of similar components provides additional information of the network structure. The proposed algorithm can also be used for community detection when the groups and the communities overlap. By introducing a tunable parameter that controls the involved effects of the heterogeneity, we can also investigate conveniently how the group structure can be coupled with the heterogeneity characteristics. In particular, an interesting example shows a group partition can evolve into a community partition in some situations when the involved heterogeneity effects are tuned. The extension of this algorithm to weighted networks is discussed as well. 
0808.01613	Graphite intercalation compound KC$_8$ revisited: a key to graphene	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:A. Grüneis, C. Attaccalite, A. Rubio, D. Vyalikh, S.L. Molodtsov, J. Fink, R. Follath, W. Eberhardt, B. Büchner, T. Pichler	Abstract:  Electrons in isolated graphene layers are a two-dimensional gas of massless Dirac Fermions. In realistic devices, however, the electronic properties are modified by elastic deformations, interlayer coupling and substrate interaction. Here we unravel the electronic structure of doped graphene, revisiting the stage one graphite intercalation compound KC$_8$ using angle--resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab--initio calculations. The full experimental dispersion is in excellent agreement to calculations of doped graphene once electron correlations are included on the $GW$ level. This highlights that KC$_8$ has negligible interlayer coupling. Therefore Dirac Fermion behaviour is preserved and we directly determine the full experimental Dirac cone of doped graphene. In addition we prove that superconductivity in KC$_8$ is mediated by electron--phonon coupling to an iTO phonon, yielding a strong kink in the quasiparticle dispersion at 166 meV. These results are key for understanding, both, the unique electronic properties of graphene and superconductivity in KC$_8$. 
0808.01614	Maximal Sets of Mutually Unbiased Quantum States in Dimension Six	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Stephen Brierley, Stefan Weigert	Abstract:  We study sets of pure states in a Hilbert space of dimension d which are mutually unbiased (MU), that is, the squares of the moduli of their scalar products are equal to zero, one, or 1/d. These sets will be called a MU constellation, and if four MU bases were to exist for d=6, they would give rise to 35 different MU constellations. Using a numerical minimisation procedure, we are able to identify only 18 of them in spite of extensive searches. The missing MU constellations provide the strongest numerical evidence so far that no seven MU bases exist in dimension six. 
0808.01615	Instability of hyper-compact Kerr-like objects	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Vitor Cardoso, Paolo Pani, Mariano Cadoni, Marco Cavaglia	Abstract:  Viable alternatives to astrophysical black holes include hyper-compact objects without horizon, such as gravastars, boson stars, wormholes and superspinars. The authors have recently shown that typical rapidly-spinning gravastars and boson stars develop a strong instability. That analysis is extended in this paper to a wide class of horizonless objects with approximate Kerr-like geometry. A detailed investigation of wormholes and superspinars is presented, using plausible models and mirror boundary conditions at the surface. Like gravastars and boson stars, these objects are unstable with very short instability timescales. This result strengthens previous conclusions that observed hyper-compact astrophysical objects with large rotation are likely to be black holes. 
0808.01616	Manin's conjecture for quartic del Pezzo surfaces with a conic fibration	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:T.D.

0808.01617	Continuity Points of Typical Bounded Functions	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Shingo Saito	Abstract:  Kostyrko and Salat showed that if a linear space of bounded functions has an element that is discontinuous almost everywhere, then a typical element in the space is discontinuous almost everywhere. We give a topological analogue of this theorem and provide some examples. 
0808.01618	Quantum computation with graphene nanoribbon	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Guo-Ping Guo, Zhi-Rong Lin, Xiao-Peng Li, Tao Tu, Guang-Can Guo	Abstract:  We propose a scalable scheme to implement quantum computation in graphene nanoribbon. It is shown that electron or hole can be naturally localized in each zigzag region for a graphene nanoribbon with a sequence of Z-shaped structure without exploiting any confined gate. An one-dimensional graphene quantum dots chain is formed in such graphene nanoribbon, where electron or hole spin can be encoded as qubits. The coupling interaction between neighboring graphene quantum dots is found to be always-on Heisenberg type. Applying the bang-bang control strategy and decoherence free subspaces encoding method, universal quantum computation is argued to be realizable with the present techniques. 
0808.01619	Coupled Painlevé systems with affine Weyl group symmetry of types $A_7^{(2)},A_5^{(2)}$ and $D_4^{(3)}$	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Yusuke Sasano	Abstract:  We find a four-parameter family of coupled Painlevé VI systems in dimension four with affine Weyl group symmetry of type $A_7^{(2)}$. This is the first example which gave higher-order Painlevé equations of type $A_{2l+5}^{(2)}$. We then give an explicit description of a confluence process from this system to a 3-parameter family of coupled Painlevé V and III systems in dimension four with $W(A_5^{(2)})$-symmetry. For a degenerate system of $A_5^{(2)}$ system, we also find a two-parameter family of ordinary differential systems in dimension four with affine Weyl group symmetry of type $D_4^{(3)}$. This is the first example which gave higher-order Painlevé equations of type $D_4^{(3)}$. We show that for each system, we give its symmetry and holomorphy conditions. These symmetries, holomorphy conditions and invariant divisors are new. 
0808.01620	Effect of self-affine fractal characteristics of surfaces on wetting	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:S. Sarkar, S. Patra, N. Gayathri, S. Banerjee	Abstract:  The relation between the contact angle of a liquid drop and the morphological parameters of self-affine solid surfaces have been investigated. We show experimentally that the wetting property of a solid surface crucially depends on the surface morphological parameters such as: (1) root mean square (rms) roughness $σ$, (2) in-plane roughness correlation length $ξ$ and (3) roughness exponent $α$ of the self-affine surface. We have shown that the contact angle monotonically decreases with the increase in the rms local surface slope $ρ$ ($\propto σ/ξ^α$) for the cases where the liquid wets the crevices of the surface upon contact. We have shown that the same solid surface can be made hydrophobic or hydrophilic by merely tuning these self-affine surface morphological parameters. 
0808.01621	Optically induced energy and spin transfer in non-resonantly coupled pairs of self-assembled CdTe/ZnTe quantum dots	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:T. Kazimierczuk (1), J. Suffczynski (1), P. Wojnar (2), A. Golnik (1), J. A. Gaj (1), P. Kossacki (1) ((1) Institute of Experimental Physics, University of Warsaw, (2) Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences)    	Abstract:  Asymmetrical horizontal interdot coupling was demonstrated to exist in a system of a single plane of self-assembled CdTe/ZnTe quantum dots. Photoluminescence excitation (PLE), second order photon correlation and optical orientation were used as main experimental tools. Each individual absorbing dot was identified by a sharp PLE resonance, assigned to neutral exciton transition, while the corresponding emission contained several excitonic transitions of different charge states in another single quantum dot different from the absorbing one. Energy and spin transfer dynamics were studied. A high efficiency of spin transfer was found from optical orientation in a vertical magnetic field (70%) as well as without the magnetic field (40%), in spite of a significant anisotropic exchange splitting of the absorbing dot. Coherent mechanism of linear-to-circular polarization conversion was identified, with an efficiency (43%) close to the theoretical limit of 50%. 
0808.01622	The nonlinear Schrödinger equations with combined nonlinearities of power-type and Hartree	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Daoyuan Fang, Zheng Han	Abstract:  This paper is devoted to a comprehensive study of the nonlinear Schrödinger equations with combined nonlinearities of the power-type and Hartree-type in any dimension n\ge3. With some structural conditions, a nearly whole picture of the interactions of these nonlinearities in the energy space is given. The method is based on the Morawetz estimates and perturbation principles. 
0808.01623	Electrostatics of surface-electrode ion traps	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Janus H. Wesenberg	Abstract:  Surface-electrode (SE) rf traps are a promising approach to manufacturing complex ion-trap networks suitable for large-scale quantum information processing. In this paper we present analytical methods for modeling SE traps in the gapless plane approximation, and apply these methods to two particular classes of SE traps. For the SE ring trap we derive analytical expressions for the trap geometry and strength, and also calculate the depth in the absence of control fields. For translationally symmetric multipole configurations (analogs of the linear Paul trap), we derive analytical expressions for electrode geometry and strength. Further, we provide arbitrarily good approximations of the trap depth in the absence of static fields and identify the requirements for obtaining maximal depth. Lastly, we show that the depth of SE multipoles can be greatly influenced by control fields. 
0808.01624	Acoustic black holes in a two-dimensional "photon-fluid"	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Francesco Marino	Abstract:  Optical field fluctuations in self-defocusing media can be described in terms of sound waves in a 2D photon-fluid. It is shown that, while the background fluid couples with the usual flat metric, sound-like waves experience an effective curved spacetime determined by the physical properties of the flow. In an optical cavity configuration, the background spacetime can be suitably controlled by the driving beam allowing the formation of acoustic ergoregions and event horizons. An experiment simulating the main features of the rotating black hole geometry is proposed. 
0808.01625	Exclusive heavy quarkonium + gamma production from e+ e- annihilation into a virtual photon	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Hee Sok Chung, Jungil Lee, Chaehyun Yu (Korea U.)    	Abstract:  We compute the cross section for exclusive production of a photon associated with a heavy quarkonium H of charge-conjugation parity C=+1 from e+ e- annihilation into a virtual photon at the center-of-momentum energy root-s=10.58 GeV. The NRQCD factorization formulas for the differential and total cross sections are obtained at leading order in the strong coupling and in the relative velocity of the heavy quark in the quarkonium rest frame. The predicted cross sections for the S-wave spin-singlet cases are about 80 fb and 50 fb for H = eta_c and eta_c(2S), respectively. Among P-wave spin-triplet charmonia, chi_{c1} has a particularly large cross section of about 14 fb. The cross sections for bottomonium states eta_b and chi_{bJ} are about 3 fb. A rough estimate of the background reveals that the signal significances for charmonium processes are sufficiently large enough to be detected with ease with the integrated luminosities available at the present B factories. 
0808.01626	Discussions on a special static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solution of Einstein's equations	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:F.Rahaman, M.Kalam, S. Chakraborty, K.Maity, B. Raychaudhuri	Abstract:  In this article, a special static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solution of Einstein's equations is provided. Though pressure and density both diverge at the origin, their ratio remains constant. The solution presented here fails to give positive pressure but nevertheless, it satisfies all energy conditions. In this new spacetime geometry, the metric becomes singular at some finite value of radial coordinate although, by using isotropic coordinates, this singularity could be avoided, as has been shown here. Some characteristics of this solution are also discussed. 
0808.01627	Quasi-commutative algebras	Category Theory (math.CT)	Authors:Alexei Davydov	Abstract:  We characterise algebras commutative with respect to a Yang-Baxter operator (quasi-commutative algebras) in terms of certain cosimplicial complexes. In some cases this characterisation allows the classification of all possible quasi-commutative structures. 
0808.01628	Doubly special relativity and translation invariance	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:S. Mignemi	Abstract:  We propose a new interpretation of doubly special relativity (DSR) based on the distinction between the momentum and the translation generators in its phase space realization. We also argue that the implementation of DSR theories does not necessarily require a deformation of the Lorentz symmetry, but only of the translation invariance. 
0808.01629	Purity of level m stratifications	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Marc-Hubert Nicole, Adrian Vasiu, Torsten Wedhorn	Abstract:  Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p>0$. Let $D_m$ be a $\BT_m$ over $k$ (i.e., an $m$-truncated Barsotti--Tate group over $k$). Let $S$ be a\break $k$-scheme and let $X$ be a $\BT_m$ over $S$. Let $S_{D_m}(X)$ be the subscheme of $S$ which describes the locus where $X$ is locally for the fppf topology isomorphic to $D_m$. If $p\ge 5$, we show that $S_{D_m}(X)$ is pure in $S$ i.e., the immersion $S_{D_m}(X) \hookrightarrow S$ is affine. For $p\in\{2,3\}$, we prove purity if $D_m$ satisfies a certain property depending only on its $p$-torsion $D_m[p]$. For $p\ge 5$, we apply the developed techniques to show that all level $m$ stratifications associated to Shimura varieties of Hodge type are pure. 
0808.01630	From inflation to late acceleration: A new cosmological paradigm	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Supratik Pal	Abstract:  A new idea of deriving a cosmological term from an underlying theory has been proposed in order to explain the expansion history of the universe. We obtain the scale factor with this derived cosmological term and demonstrate that it reflects all the characteristics of the expanding universe in different era so as to result in a transition from inflation to late acceleration through intermediate decelerating phases by this single entity. We further discuss certain observational aspects of this paradigm. 
0808.01631	Non-compact QED3 at finite temperature: the confinement-deconfinement transition	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Roberto Fiore, Pietro Giudice, Alessandro Papa	Abstract:  The confinement-deconfinement phase transition is explored by lattice numerical simulations in non-compact (2+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics with massive fermions at finite temperature. The existence of two phases, one with and the other without confinement of fractional charges, is related to the realization of the Z symmetry. The order parameter of this transition can be clearly identified. We show that it is possible to detect the critical temperature for a given value of the fermion mass, by exploiting suitable lattice operators as probes of the Z symmetry. Moreover, the large-distance behavior of the correlation of these operators permits to distinguish the phase with Coulomb-confinement from the Debye-screened phase. The resulting scenario is compatible with the existence of a Berezinsky-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Some investigations are presented on the possible relation between chiral and deconfinement transitions and on the role of ``monopoles''. 
0808.01632	Networks of quantum nanorings: programmable spintronic devices	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Peter Foldi, Orsolya Kalman, Mihaly G. Benedict, F. M. Peeters	Abstract:  An array of quantum rings with local (ring by ring) modulation of the spin orbit interaction (SOI) can lead to novel effects in spin state transformation of electrons. It is shown that already small (3x3, 5x5) networks are remarkably versatile from this point of view: Working in a given network geometry, the input current can be directed to any of the output ports, simply by changing the SOI strengths by external gate voltages. Additionally, the same network with different SOI strengths can be completely analogous to the Stern-Gerlach device, exhibiting spatial-spin entanglement. 
0808.01633	Proper motions of field L and T dwarfs -II	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S.L. Casewell, R.F. Jameson, M.R. Burleigh	Abstract:  By using images taken with WFCAM on UKIRT and SofI on the NTT and combining them with 2MASS we have measured proper motions for 126 L and T dwarfs in the dwarf archive. Two of these L dwarfs appear to have M dwarf common proper motion companions, and 2 also appear to be high velocity dwarfs, indicating possible membership of the thick disc. We have also compared the motion of these 126 objects to that of numerous moving groups, and have identified new members of the Hyades, Ursa Major and Pleiades moving groups. These new objects, as well as those identified in Jameson et al. (2008) have allowed us to refine the L dwarf sequence for Ursa Major that was defined by Jameson et al. (2008). 
0808.01634	A new equation for the mid-plane potential of power law discs. II. Exact solutions and approximate formulae	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J.-M. Huré, F. Hersant, C. Carreau, J.-P. Busset	Abstract:  The first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that describes the mid-plane gravitational potential in flat finite size discs in which the surface density is a power-law function of the radius R with exponent s (Huré & Hersant 2007) is solved exactly in terms of infinite series. The formal solution of the ODE is derived and then converted into a series representation by expanding the elliptic integral of the first kind over its modulus before analytical integration. Inside the disc, the gravitational potential consists of three terms: a power law of radius R with index 1+s, and two infinite series of the variables R and 1/R. The convergence of the series can be accelerated, enabling the construction of reliable approximations. At the lowest-order, the potential inside large astrophysical discs (s ~ -1.5 +/- 1) is described by a very simple formula whose accuracy (a few percent typically) is easily increased by considering successive orders through a recurrence. A basic algorithm is given. Applications concern all theoretical models and numerical simulations where the influence of disc gravity must be checked and/or reliably taken into account. 
0808.01635	Resonant Transmission of Electromagnetic Fields through Subwavelength Zero-$ε$ Slits	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Klaus Halterman, Simin Feng	Abstract:  We theoretically investigate the transmission of electromagnetic radiation through a metal plate with a zero-$ε$ metamaterial slit, where the permittivity tends towards zero over a given bandwidth. Our analytic results demonstrate that the transmission coefficient can be substantial for a broad range of slit geometries, including subwavelength widths that are many wavelengths long. This novel resonant effect has features quite unlike the Fabry-Pérot-like resonances that have been observed in conductors with deep channels. We further reveal that these high impedance ultranarrow zero-$ε$ channels can have significantly {\it greater} transmission compared to slits with no wave impedance difference across them. 
0808.01636	Electronic properties of the armchair graphene nanoribbon	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:A.V. Rozhkov, S. Savel'ev, Franco Nori	Abstract:  We investigate the electronic band structure of an undoped graphene armchair nanoribbon. We demonstrate that such nanoribbon always has a gap in its electronic spectrum. Indeed, even in the situations where simple single-electron calculations predict a metallic dispersion, the system is unstable with respect to the deformation of the carbon-carbon bonds dangling at the edges of the armchair nanoribbon. The edge bonds' deformation couples electron and hole states with equal momentum. This coupling opens a gap at the Fermi level. In a realistic sample, however, it is unlikely that this instability could be observed in its pure form. Namely, since chemical properties of the dangling carbon atoms are different from chemical properties of the atoms inside the sample (for example, the atoms at the edge have only two neighbours, besides additional non-carbon atoms might be attached to passivate unpaired covalent carbon bonds), it is very probable that the bonds at the edge are deformed due to chemical interactions. This chemically-induced modification of the nanoribbon's edges can be viewed as an effective field biasing our predicted instability in a particular direction. Yet by disordering this field (e.g., through random substitution of the radicals attached to the edges) we may tune the system back to the critical regime and vary the electronic properties of the system. For example, we show that electrical transport through a nanoribbon is strongly affected by such disorder. 
0808.01637	Near-infrared wavefront sensing for the VLT interferometer	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Stefan Hippler, Wolfgang Brandner, Yann Clénet, Felix Hormuth, Eric Gendron, Thomas Henning, Ralf Klein, Rainer Lenzen, Daniel Meschke, Vianak Naranjo, Udo Neumann, José Ricardo Ramos, Ralf-Rainer Rohloff, Frank Eisenhauer	Abstract:  The very large telescope (VLT) interferometer (VLTI) in its current operating state is equipped with high-order adaptive optics (MACAO) working in the visible spectrum. A low-order near-infrared wavefront sensor (IRIS) is available to measure non-common path tilt aberrations downstream the high-order deformable mirror. For the next generation of VLTI instrumentation, in particular for the designated GRAVITY instrument, we have examined various designs of a four channel high-order near-infrared wavefront sensor. Particular objectives of our study were the specification of the near-infrared detector in combination with a standard wavefront sensing system. In this paper we present the preliminary design of a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor operating in the near-infrared wavelength range, which is capable of measuring the wavefronts of four telescopes simultaneously. We further present results of our design study, which aimed at providing a first instrumental concept for GRAVITY. 
0808.01638	Executive Summary of the Workshop on Polarisation and Beam Energy Measurements at the ILC	Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph)	Authors:D. Käfer, J. List, K. Mönig, K.C. Moffeit, G. Moortgat-Pick, S. Riemann, P. Schüler, E. Torrence, M. Woods, et al    	Abstract:  This note summarizes the results of the "Workshop on Polarisation and Beam Energy Measurements at the ILC", held at DESY (Zeuthen) April 9-11 2008. The topics for the workshop included (i) physics requirements, (ii) polarised sources and low energy polarimetry, (iii) BDS polarimeters, (iv) BDS energy spectrometers, and (v) physics-based measurements of beam polarisation and beam energy from collider data. Discussions focused on the current ILC baseline programme as described in the Reference Design Report (RDR), which includes physics runs at beam energies between 100 and 250 GeV, as well as calibration runs on the Z-pole. Electron polarisation of P_e- >~ 80% and positron polarisation of P_e+ >~ 30% are part of the baseline configuration of the machine. Energy and polarisation measurements for ILC options beyond the baseline, including Z-pole running and the 1 TeV energy upgrade, were also discussed. 
0808.01639	Is "Spike" a Reliable Feature in Porb Distribution of AM HER Stars?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Alex Golovin, Mykola Malygin, Elena Pavlenko	Abstract:  Orbital periods in AM Her stars (polars) are synchronized with spin periods of white dwarf by its high magnetic field. Since the last study of Porb distribution of these systems, the number of known objects of such type has more than doubled. This challenged us to compile a new updated catalogue of cataclysmic variables with highly magnetic white dwarfs (polars) and to study their Porb distribution. In this paper we also discus if "spike" is reliable feature in the distribution. ("Spike" is a concentration of polars in the distribution of their orbital periods near Porb = 114 min and was previously discussed by Ritter & Kolb (1992) and Shahbaz & Wood (1996).) 
0808.01640	Decoherence-free quantum information in Markovian systems	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Manas K. Patra, Peter G. Brooke	Abstract:  Decoherence in Markovian systems can result indirectly from the action of a system Hamiltonian which is usually fixed and unavoidable. Here, we show that in general in Markovian systems, because of the system Hamiltonian, quantum information decoheres. We give conditions for the system Hamiltonian that must be satisfied if coherence is to be preserved. Finally, we show how to construct robust subspaces for quantum information processing. 
0808.01641	Characterization Of any Non-linear Boolean function Using A Set of Linear Operators	Computational Complexity (cs.CC)	Authors:Sudhakar Sahoo, Pabitra Pal Choudhury, Mithun Chakraborty	Abstract:  Global dynamics of a non-linear Cellular Automata is, in general irregular, asymmetric and unpredictable as opposed to that of a linear CA, which is highly systematic and tractable. In the past efforts have been made to systematize non-linear CA evolutions in the light of Boolean derivatives and Jacobian Matrices. In this paper two different efforts have been made: first we try to systematize non-linear CA evolution in the light of deviant states and non-deviant states. For all the non-deviant states the nearest linear rule matrix is applicable where as for the deviant states we have a set of other matrices. Second using algebraic manipulation, an efficient algorithm is proposed by which every Non-linear Boolean function can be characterized by a sequence of binary matrices. 
0808.01642	Exactly Solvable Potentials and Romanovski Polynomials in Quantum Mechanics	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:D. E. Alvarez-Castillo	Abstract:  Orthogonal Polynomials in Quantum Mechanics. Exact solutions of the Schrodinger equation with the hyperbolic Scarf potential (Scarf II) in terms of Romanovski polynomials. Among the applications included is the solution of the problem of an electron within a particular potential leading to the definition of new non-spherical angular functions. 
0808.01643	Lanczos-adapted time evolution for open boundary quantum transport	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Claudio Verdozzi, Carl-Olof Almbladh	Abstract:  We increase the efficiency of a recently proposed time integration scheme for time dependent quantum transport by using the Lanczos method for time evolution. We illustrate our modified scheme in terms of a simple one dimensional model. Our results show that the Lanczos-adapted scheme gives a large increase in numerical efficiency, and is an advantageous route for numerical time integration in ab-initio treatment of open boundary quantum transport phenomena. 
0808.01644	Generalized Cheeger-Gromoll Metrics and the Hopf map	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:M. Benyounes, E. Loubeau, S. Nishikawa	Abstract:  We show, using two different approaches, that there exists a family of Riemannian metrics on the tangent bundle of a two-sphere, which induces metrics of constant curvature on its unit tangent bundle. In other words, given such a metric on the tangent bundle of a two-sphere, the Hopf map is identified with a Riemannian submersion from the universal covering space of the unit tangent bundle onto the two-sphere. A hyperbolic counterpart dealing with the tangent bundle of a hyperbolic plane is also presented. 
0808.01645	Update analysis of tau- --> V P- nu(tau): Theory and Experiment	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Zhi-Hui Guo	Abstract:  Within the resonance chiral theory, we have studied the process of a tau lepton decaying into a vector resonance plus a pseudo-Goldstone meson and a tau neutrino. Two kinds of processes are discussed: (a) tau- --> (rho pi-,omega pi-, phi pi-, K*0 K-) nu(tau), belonging to Delta S=0 processes and (b) Delta S = 1 processes, such as tau- --> (rho K-, omega K-,phi K-,\bar{K*0} pi-) nu(tau). To fit the tau- --> omega pi- nu(tau) spectral function and the decay distribution of tau- --> omega K- nu(tau) to get unknown resonance couplings, we then make a prediction for branching ratios of all channels. 
0808.01646	Slow-Roll Suppression of Adiabatic Instabilities in Coupled Scalar Field-Dark Matter Models	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Pier Stefano Corasaniti (LUTH, Meudon)    	Abstract:  We study the evolution of linear density perturbations in the context of interacting scalar field-dark matter cosmologies, where the presence of the coupling acts as a stabilization mechanism for the runaway behavior of the scalar self-interaction potential as in the case of the Chameleon model. We show that in the "adiabatic" background regime of the system the rise of unstable growing modes of the perturbations is suppressed by the slow-roll dynamics of the field. Furthermore the coupled system behaves as an inhomogeneous adiabatic fluid. In contrast instabilities may develop for large values of the coupling constant, or along non-adiabatic solutions, characterized by a period of high-frequency dumped oscillations of the scalar field. In the latter case the dynamical instabilities of the field fluctuations, which are typical of oscillatory scalar field regimes, are amplified and transmitted by the coupling to dark matter perturbations. 
0808.01647	The formation of the first galaxies and the transition to low-mass star formation	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Thomas H. Greif, Dominik R. G. Schleicher, Jarrett L. Johnson, Anne-Katharina Jappsen, Ralf S. Klessen, Paul C. Clark, Simon C. O. Glover, Athena Stacy, Volker Bromm	Abstract:  The formation of the first galaxies at redshifts z ~ 10-15 signaled the transition from the simple initial state of the universe to one of ever increasing complexity. We here review recent progress in understanding their assembly process with numerical simulations, starting with cosmological initial conditions and modelling the detailed physics of star formation. In this context we emphasize the importance and influence of selecting appropriate initial conditions for the star formation process. We revisit the notion of a critical metallicity resulting in the transition from primordial to present-day initial mass functions and highlight its dependence on additional cooling mechanisms and the exact initial conditions. We also review recent work on the ability of dust cooling to provide the transition to present-day low-mass star formation. In particular, we highlight the extreme conditions under which this transition mechanism occurs, with violent fragmentation in dense gas resulting in tightly packed clusters. 
0808.01648	Radio-frequency driven dipole-dipole interactions in spatially separated volumes	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Atreju Tauschinsky, C. S. E. van Ditzhuijzen, L. D. Noordam, H. B. van Linden van den Heuvell	Abstract:  Radio-frequency (rf) fields in the MHz range are used to induce resonant energy transfer between cold Rydberg atoms in spatially separated volumes. After laser preparation of the Rydberg atoms, dipole-dipole coupling excites the 49s atoms in one cylinder to the 49p state while the 41d atoms in the second cylinder are transferred down to the 42p state. The energy exchanged between the atoms in this process is 33 GHz. An external rf-field brings this energy transfer into resonance. The strength of the interaction has been investigated as a function of amplitude (0-1 V/cm) and frequency (1-30 MHz) of the rf-field and as a function of a static field offset. Multi-photon transitions up to fifth order as well as selection rules prohibiting the process at certain fields have been observed. The width of the resonances has been reduced compared to earlier results by switching off external magnetic fields of the magneto-optical trap, making sub-MHz spectroscopy possible. All features are well reproduced by theoretical calculations taking the strong ac-Stark shift due to the rf-field into account. 
0808.01649	Entangling characterization of (SWAP)1/m and Controlled unitary gates	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:S.Balakrishnan, R.Sankaranarayanan	Abstract:  We study the entangling power and perfect entangler nature of (SWAP)1/m, for m>=1, and controlled unitary (CU) gates. It is shown that (SWAP)1/2 is the only perfect entangler in the family. On the other hand, a subset of CU which is locally equivalent to CNOT is identified. It is shown that the subset, which is a perfect entangler, must necessarily possess the maximum entangling power. 
0808.01650	Improved method for partial-wave decomposition of two-pion exchange three-nucleon force	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Rimantas Lazauskas	Abstract:  In this article an efficient method to calculate the matrix elements of three-nucleon force is presented. The new method is improved version of partial-wave decomposition presented in Few-Body Syst. 22 (1997) 107, which simplifies expression to be evaluated and permits to reduce computational effort as much as six times. Proposed method naturally applies to Faddeev-type calculations but also can be used by any method relaying on partial-wave decomposition. 
0808.01651	Estimates for parameters and characteristics of the confining SU(3)-gluonic field in an $η^\prime$-meson	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Yu. P. Goncharov (Sankt-Petersburg State Polytechnical University, Russia)    	Abstract:  The confinement mechanism proposed earlier by the author is applied to estimate the possible parameters of the confining SU(3)-gluonic field in an $η^\prime$-meson. For this aim the electric form factor of an $η^\prime$-meson is nonperturbatively computed in an explicit analytic form. The estimates obtained are also consistent with the width of the electromagnetic decay $η^\prime\to2γ$. The corresponding estimates of the gluon concentrations, electric and magnetic colour field strengths are also adduced for the mentioned field at the scales of the meson under consideration. 
0808.01652	Quark stars: their influence on Astroparticle Physics	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Sanjay K. Ghosh	Abstract:  We discuss some of the recent developments in the quark star physics along with the consequences of possible hadron to quark phase transition at high density scenario of neutron stars and their implications on the Astroparticle Physics. 
0808.01653	Impact of misalignments on the analysis of B decays	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:M. Gersabeck, J. Nardulli, E. Rodrigues	Abstract:  This note investigates the effects of a misaligned tracking system on the analysis of B decays. Misalignment effects of both the vertex locator and the inner and outer T-stations have been studied. $z$-scaling effects of the vertex locator are also considered. It is proven that misalignments of the order of the detector single-hit resolutions have little or negligible effects on the quality of the reconstruction and of the analysis of B decays. The studies were performed with a sample of $B^0_{(s)} \to h^+h^{'-}$ decays, but the impact of misalignments on the performance of the pattern recognition algorithms and on the primary vertex resolutions, assessed for the first time, are rather general and not restricted to $B^0_{(s)} \to h^+h^{'-}$ decays. 
0808.01654	Superfilters, Ramsey theory, and van der Waerden's Theorem	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Nadav Samet, Boaz Tsaban	Abstract:  Superfilters are generalized ultrafilters, which capture the underlying concept in Ramsey theoretic theorems such as van der Waerden's Theorem. We establish several properties of superfilters, which generalize both Ramsey's Theorem and its variant for ultrafilters on the natural numbers. We use them to confirm a conjecture of Kočinac and Di Maio, which is a generalization of a Ramsey theoretic result of Scheepers, concerning selections from open covers. Following Bergelson and Hindman's 1989 Theorem, we present a new simultaneous generalization of the theorems of Ramsey, van der Waerden, Schur, Folkman-Rado-Sanders, Rado, and others, where the colored sets can be much smaller than the full set of natural numbers. 
0808.01655	Shelf space strategy in long-tail markets	General Finance (q-fin.GN)	Authors:R. Alexander Bentley, Paul Ormerod, Mark E. Madsen	Abstract:  The Internet is known to have had a powerful impact on on-line retailer strategies in markets characterised by long-tail distribution of sales. Such retailers can exploit the long tail of the market, since they are effectively without physical limit on the number of choices on offer. Here we examine two extensions of this phenomenon. First, we introduce turnover into the long-tail distribution of sales. Although over any given period such as a week or a month, the distribution is right-skewed and often power law distributed, over time there is considerable turnover in the rankings of sales of individual products. Second, we establish some initial results on the implications for shelf-space strategy of physical retailers in such markets. 
0808.01656	Can the spinning of elementary particles produce the rest energy mc2? The vortex model of elementary particles	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:Antal Rockenbauer	Abstract:  The Dirac equation describes the motion of electrons in electromagnetic field, but it considers spin as intrinsic property without any real motion. We postulate spin as the intrinsic feature of vacuum, in which the incident electromagnetic radiation can create vortices with well defined spinning frequency and completely undefined axis of rotation. The vortices have finite surface determined by the spinning frequency that makes the peripheral speed equal to the velocity of light. According to the Lorentz equations of special relativity, the product of radius and mass of rotating objects is independent of the frequency of rotation and it is equal to 3/4h/2pic for all fermions. This invariance explains how the light with infinite spatial dimension and zero mass can produce finite mass and size for the particles in the pair-creation processes. The vortex model interprets the rest energy as the kinetic energy of spinning motion. The isotropic character of spinning can be represented by helical motion with right or left-handed chirality corresponding to the duality of matter and anti-matter. Conservation rule is proposed for the chirality explaining the electron-positron annihilation and the pair-creation processes. The vortex induced field rotation around the particle can reproduce the gravitational formula if the curvature of field is derived from the Lorentz contraction on the surface of rotating sphere. Generalized Hamiltonian is suggested for the fermions describing the spinning motion in the internal frame of particles, it reproduces the Dirac equation, when the rest energy is predominant. 
0808.01657	Periodicity, repetitions, and orbits of an automatic sequence	Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)	Authors:Jean-Paul Allouche, Narad Rampersad, Jeffrey Shallit	Abstract:  We revisit a technique of S. Lehr on automata and use it to prove old and new results in a simple way. We give a very simple proof of the 1986 theorem of Honkala that it is decidable whether a given k-automatic sequence is ultimately periodic. We prove that it is decidable whether a given k-automatic sequence is overlap-free (or squareefree, or cubefree, etc.) We prove that the lexicographically least sequence in the orbit closure of a k-automatic sequence is k-automatic, and use this last result to show that several related quantities, such as the critical exponent, irrationality measure, and recurrence quotient for Sturmian words with slope alpha, have automatic continued fraction expansions if alpha does. 
0808.01658	Entanglement of Formation for Gaussian States	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:J. Solomon Ivan, R. Simon	Abstract:  The entanglement of formation (EOF) is computed for arbitrary two-mode Gaussian states. Apart from a conjecture, our analysis rests on two main ingredients. The first is a four-parameter canonical form we develop for the covariance matrix, one of these parameters acting as a measure of EOF, and the second is a generalisation of the EPR correlation, used in the work of Giedke {\em et al} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 91}, 107901 (2003)], to noncommuting variables. The conjecture itself is in respect of an extremal property of this generalized EPR correlation. 
0808.01659	Energy spectrum of ultra high energy cosmic rays	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ioana C. Maris, for the Pierre Auger Collaboration	Abstract:  The construction of the southern site of the Pierre Auger Observatory is almost completed. Three independent measurements of the flux of the cosmic rays with energies larger than 1 EeV have been performed during the construction phase. The surface detector data collected until August 2007 have been used to establish a flux suppression at the highest energies with a 6 sigma significance. The observations of cosmic rays by the fluorescence detector allowed the extension of the energy spectrum to lower energies, where the efficiency of the surface detector is less than 100% and a change in the spectral index is expected. 
0808.01660	Cavity photon counting: ab-initio derivation of the quantum jump superoperators and comparison of the existing models	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Teppo Hayrynen, Jani Oksanen, Jukka Tulkki	Abstract:  Time development of electromagnetic fields in closed cavities under continuous detection of photons continues to be a subject of confusing controversy. Recently Dodonov et al. [Phys. Rev. A, 75, 013806, 2007] argued that their model of quantum superoperators (E model) invalidates some of the predictions of the previously introduced photon counting model of Srinivas and Davies [J. Mod. Optic. 28, 981, 1981] (SD model). Both the SD and the E models are based on two postulated quantum jump superoperators: (1) the one-count operator corresponding to the absorption of a single photon and (2) the no-count operator. In this work we develop a stochastic difference equation that describes the dissipative coupling of the cavity field and the detector. The difference equation is based on non-perturbative treatment of the cavity-detector coupling. In spite of being non-integrable due to the coupling of the detector with an external reservoir it can be used to derive the exact forms of the quantum jump superoperators. When applied to a particular photon counting measurement our theory gives predictions identical with those of the SD model which should be considered a non-perturbative and ab-initio result. It is pointed out that available experimental results coincide with the results given by the ab-initio SD model. We summarize some of the key characteristics of cavity fields and photon counting processes to demonstrate that the results given by the SD model are consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics while those given by the E model are not. 
0808.01661	Medical robotics: where we come from, where we are and where we could go	Robotics (cs.RO)	Authors:Jocelyne Troccaz (TIMC)    	Abstract:  This short note presents a viewpoint about medical robotics. 
0808.01662	Turning with the others: novel transitions in an SPP model with coupling of accelerations	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Peter Szabo, Mate Nagy, Tamas Vicsek	Abstract:  We consider a three dimensional, generalized version of the original SPP model for collective motion. By extending the factors influencing the ordering, we investigate the case when the movement of the self-propelled particles (SPP-s) depends on both the velocity and the acceleration of the neighboring particles, instead of being determined solely by the former one. By changing the value of a weight parameter s determining the relative influence of the velocity and the acceleration terms, the system undergoes a kinetic phase transition as a function of a behavioral pattern. Below a critical value of s the system exhibits disordered motion, while above it the dynamics resembles that of the SPP model. We argue that in nature evolutionary processes can drive the strategy variable s towards the critical point, where information exchange between the units of a system is maximal. 
0808.01663	How incomputable is the separable Hahn-Banach theorem?	Logic (math.LO)	Authors:Guido Gherardi, Alberto Marcone	Abstract:  We determine the computational complexity of the Hahn-Banach Extension Theorem. To do so, we investigate some basic connections between reverse mathematics and computable analysis. In particular, we use Weak Konig's Lemma within the framework of computable analysis to classify incomputable functions of low complexity. By defining the multi-valued function Sep and a natural notion of reducibility for multi-valued functions, we obtain a computational counterpart of the subsystem of second order arithmetic WKL_0. We study analogies and differences between WKL_0 and the class of Sep-computable multi-valued functions. Extending work of Brattka, we show that a natural multi-valued function associated with the Hahn-Banach Extension Theorem is Sep-complete. 
0808.01664	The Weil Representation in Characteristic Two	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Shamgar Gurevich, Ronny Hadani	Abstract:  In this paper we construct a new variant of the Weil representation, associated with a symplectic vector space V defined over a finite field of characteristic two. Our variant is a representation of a bigger group than that of Weil. In the course, we develop the formalism of canonical vector spaces, which enables us to realize the bigger symmetry group and the representation in a transparent manner. 
0808.01665	Anomalous elasticity in nematic and smectic elastomer tubule	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Olaf Stenull	Abstract:  We study anomalous elasticity in the tubule phases of nematic and smectic elastomer membranes, which are flat in one direction and crumpled in another. These phases share the same macroscopic symmetry properties including spontaneously-broken in-plane isotropy and hence belong to the same universality class. Below an upper critical value $D_c =3$ of the membranes' intrinsic dimension D, thermal fluctuations renormalize the elasticity with respect to elastic displacements along the tubule axis so that elastic moduli for compression along the tubule axis and for bending the tubule axis become length-scale dependent. This anomalous elasticity belongs to the same universality class as that of d-dimensional conventional smectics with D taking on the role of d. For physical tubule, D=2, this anomaly is of power-law type and thus might by easier to detect experimentally than the logarithmic anomaly in conventional smectics. 
0808.01666	Perfect excitation of a matter qubit by a single photon in free space	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Magdalena Stobińska, Gernot Alber, Gerd Leuchs	Abstract:  We propose a scheme for perfect excitation of a single two-level atom by a single photon in free space. The photon state has to match the time reversed photon state originating from spontaneous decay of a two-level system. We discuss its experimental preparation. The state is characterized by a particular asymmetric exponentially-shaped temporal profile. Any deviations from this ideal state limit the maximum absorption. Although perfect excitation requires an infinite amount of time we demonstrate that there is a class of initial one-photon quantum states which can achieve almost perfect absorption even for a finite interaction time. Our results pave the way for realizing perfect coupling between flying and stationary qubits in free space thus opening a possibility for building scalable quantum networks. 
0808.01667	Combinatorics of labelling in higher dimensional automata	Algebraic Topology (math.AT)	Authors:Philippe Gaucher	Abstract:  The main idea for interpreting concurrent processes as labelled precubical sets is that a given set of n actions running concurrently must be assembled to a labelled n-cube, in exactly one way. The main ingredient is the non-functorial construction called labelled directed coskeleton. It is defined as a subobject of the labelled coskeleton, the latter coinciding in the unlabelled case with the right adjoint to the truncation functor. This non-functorial construction is necessary since the labelled coskeleton functor of the category of labelled precubical sets does not fulfil the above requirement. We prove in this paper that it is possible to force the labelled coskeleton functor to be well-behaved by working with labelled transverse symmetric precubical sets. Moreover, we prove that this solution is the only one. A transverse symmetric precubical set is a precubical set equipped with symmetry maps and with a new kind of degeneracy map called transverse degeneracy. Finally, we also prove that the two settings are equivalent from a directed algebraic topological viewpoint. To illustrate, a new semantics of CCS, equivalent to the old one, is given. 
0808.01668	Reliability of P mode event classification using contemporaneous BiSON and GOLF observations	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:R. Simoniello, W. J. Chaplin, Y. P. Elsworth, R. A. Garcia	Abstract:  We carried out a comparison of the signals seen in contemporaneous BiSON and GOLF data sets. Both instruments perform Doppler shift velocity measurements in integrated sunlight, although BiSON perform measurements from the two wings of potassium absorption line and GOLF from one wing of the NaD1 line. Discrepancies between the two datasets have been observed. We show,in fact, that the relative power depends on the wing in which GOLF data observes. During the blue wing period, the relative power is much higher than in BiSON datasets, while a good agreement has been observed during the red period. 
0808.01669	Extremal distributions for tail probabilities of sums of iid random variables on [0,1]	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Ludolf E. Meester	Abstract:  Two old conjectures from problem sections, one of which from SIAM Review, concern the question of finding distributions that maximize P(Sn <= t), where Sn is the sum of i.i.d. random variables X1, ..., Xn on the interval [0,1], satisfying E[X1]=m. In this paper a Lagrange multiplier technique is applied to this problem, yielding necessary conditions for distributions to be extremal, for arbitrary n. For n=2, a complete solution is derived from them: extremal distributions are discrete and have one of the following supports, depending on m and t: {0,t}, {t-1,1}, {t/2,1}, or {0,t,1}. These results suffice to refute both conjectures. However, acquired insight naturally leads to a revised conjecture: that extremal distributions always have at most three support points and belong to a (for each n, specified) finite collection of two and three point distributions. 
0808.01670	Electromagnetic Fields Produced by Moving Sources in a Curved Beam Pipe	Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph)	Authors:Shin-itiro Goto, Robin W Tucker	Abstract:  A new geometrical perturbation scheme is developed in order to calculate the electromagnetic fields produced by charged sources in prescribed motion moving in a non-straight perfectly conducting beam pipe. The pipe is regarded as a perturbed infinitely long hollow right-circular cylinder. The perturbation maintains the pipe's circular cross-section while deforming its axis into a planar space-curve with, in general, non-constant curvature. Various charged source models are considered including a charged bunch and an off-axis point particle. In the ultra-relativistic limit this permits a calculation of the longitudinal wake potential in terms of powers of the product of the pipe radius and the arbitrarily varying curvature of the axial space-curve. Analytic expressions to leading order are presented for beam pipes with piecewise defined constant curvature modelling pipes with straight segments linked by circular arcs of finite length. The language of differential forms is used throughout and to illustrate the power of this formalism a pedagogical introduction is developed by deriving the theory ab-initio from Maxwell's equations expressed intrinsically as a differential system on (Minkowski) spacetime. 
0808.01671	Algorithmic Pricing via Virtual Valuations	Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)	Authors:Shuchi Chawla, Jason Hartline, Robert Kleinberg	Abstract:  Algorithmic pricing is the computational problem that sellers (e.g., in supermarkets) face when trying to set prices for their items to maximize their profit in the presence of a known demand. Guruswami et al. (2005) propose this problem and give logarithmic approximations (in the number of consumers) when each consumer's values for bundles are known precisely. Subsequently several versions of the problem have been shown to have poly-logarithmic inapproximability. This problem has direct ties to the important open question of better understanding the Bayesian optimal mechanism in multi-parameter settings; however, logarithmic approximations are inadequate for this purpose. It is therefore of vital interest to consider special cases where constant approximations are possible. We consider the unit-demand variant of this problem. Here a consumer has a valuation for each different item and their value for a set of items is simply the maximum value they have for any item in the set. We assume that the preferences of the consumers are drawn from a distribution, the standard assumption in economics; furthermore, the setting of a specific set of customers with known preferences, which is employed in all prior work in algorithmic pricing, is a special case of this general problem, where there is a discrete Bayesian distribution for preferences specified by picking one consumer uniformly from the given set of consumers. Our work complements these existing works by considering the case where the consumer's valuations for the different items are independent random variables. Our main result is a constant approximation that makes use of an interesting connection between this problem and the concept of virtual valuations from the single-parameter Bayesian optimal mechanism design literature. 
0808.01672	Geometric effects in lattice QCD thermodynamics	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Marco Panero	Abstract:  I present a study of the equation of state in quenched QCD, discussing some systematic effects related to the lattice geometry. In particular, I comment on the modification of the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a gas of free gluons in a finite system, and study the impact it might have on numerical results at high temperatures, for the typical parameters of current lattice simulations. Finally, I apply the results of this study to the analysis of data obtained from simulations of SU(N) gauge theories with N>3 colors, in a temperature range up to 3T_c, where infrared effects appear to be under control. Preliminary results for various thermodynamic observables for SU(4), SU(5) and SU(6) gauge theories are found to be close to each other and to those for SU(3), in agreement with other similar studies. This may be relevant for the theoretical description of the QCD plasma. 
0808.01673	Generalized entropic structures and non-generality of Jaynes' Formalism	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Thomas Oikonomou, Ugur Tirnakli	Abstract:  The extremization of an appropriate entropic functional may yield to the probability distribution functions maximizing the respective entropic structure. This procedure is known in Statistical Mechanics and Information Theory as Jaynes' Formalism and has been up to now a standard methodology for deriving the aforementioned distributions. However, the results of this formalism do not always coincide with the ones obtained following different approaches. In this study we analyse these inconsistencies in detail and demonstrate that Jaynes' formalism leads to correct results only for specific entropy definitions. 
0808.01674	Spontaneous Polarisation Build up in a Room Temperature Polariton Laser	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:J.J. Baumberg, A.V. Kavokin, S. Christopoulos, A.J.D. Grundy, R. Butte, G. Christmann, D.D. Solnyshkov, G. Malpuech, G. Baldassarri Hoger von Hogersthal, E. Feltin, J.-F. Carlin, N. Grandjean	Abstract:  We observe the build up of strong (~50%) spontaneous vector polarisation in emission from a GaN-based polariton laser excited by short optical pulses at room temperature. The Stokes vector of emitted light changes its orientation randomly from one excitation pulse to another, so that the time-integrated polarisation remains zero. This behaviour is completely different to any previous laser. We interpret this observation in terms of the spontaneous symmetry breaking in a Bose-Einstein condensate of exciton-polaritons. 
0808.01675	Metallicity in the half-filled Holstein-Hubbard model	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:H. Fehske, G. Hager, J. Jeckelmann	Abstract:  We re-examine the Peierls insulator to Mott insulator transition scenario in the one-dimensional Holstein-Hubbard model where, at half-filling, electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions compete for establishing charge- and spin-density-wave states, respectively. By means of large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations we determine the spin, single-particle and two-particle excitation gaps and prove--in the course of a careful finite-size scaling analysis--recent claims for an intervening metallic phase in the weak-coupling regime. We show that for large phonon frequencies the metallic region is even more extended than previously expected, and subdivided into ordinary Luttinger liquid and bipolaronic liquid phases. 
0808.01676	Vacuum polarization in graphene with a topological defect	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Yu.A.Sitenko, N.D.Vlasii	Abstract:  The influence of a topological defect in graphene on the ground state of electronic quasiparticle excitations is studied in the framework of the long-wavelength continuum model originating in the tight-binding approximation for the nearest neighbour interaction in the graphitic lattice. A topological defect that rolls up a graphitic sheet into a nanocone is represented by a pointlike pseudomagnetic vortex with a flux which is related to the deficit angle of the cone. The method of self-adjoint extensions is employed to define the set of physically acceptable boundary conditions at the apex of the nanocone. The electronic system on a graphitic nanocone is found to acquire the ground state condensate and current of special type, and we determine the dependence of these quantities on the deficit angle of the nanocone, continuous parameter of the boundary condition at the apex, and the distance from the apex. 
0808.01677	3 Dimensional N=8 Supersymmetric Field Theory Revisited	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Mahdi Torabian (ICTP)    	Abstract:  Inspired by ideas regarding Hermitian NxN matrix fields obeying a non-associative algebra, 3-dimensional N=8 SUSic field theories are proposed to on-shell represent subalgebras of OSp(8|2) and OSp(8|4) groups of SUSY transformations. They are theories of 8 scalar and 8 spinor fields with Yukawa, quartic and sextic self-interactions. The actions as their R-symmetry exhibit only SO(7) or SO(4)xSO(4) subgroups of full SO(8) automorphisms. It is argued that the number of degrees of freedom scale like N^{3/2}. There also exists an extra S_N permutation symmetry group. 
0808.01678	Computability of entropy and information in classical Hamiltonian systems	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Sungyun Kim	Abstract:  We consider the computability of entropy and information in classical Hamiltonian systems. We define the information part and total information capacity part of entropy in classical Hamiltonian systems using relative information under a computable discrete partition. Using a recursively enumerable nonrecursive set it is shown that even though the initial probability distribution, entropy, Hamiltonian and its partial derivatives are computable under a computable partition, the time evolution of its information capacity under the original partition can grow faster than any recursive function. This implies that even though the probability measure and information are conserved in classical Hamiltonian time evolution we might not actually compute the information with respect to the original computable partition. 
0808.01679	Regularisation and the Mullineux map	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Matthew Fayers	Abstract:  We classify the pairs of conjugate partitions whose regularisations are images of each other under the Mullineux map.

0808.01680	High-dimensional Z' phenomenology at hadron colliders	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:B. Fuks, J. J. van der Bij, Q. Xu	Abstract:  We study the phenomenology of a Z'-boson field coupled to hypercharge. The Z' propagator has a non-trivial Källén-Lehmann spectral density due to the mixing with a higher dimensional inert vector field. As a consequence detection possibilities at hadron colliders are reduced. We determine the range of parameters where this field can be studied at the Tevatron and the LHC through its production cross section via the Drell-Yan mechanism. 
0808.01681	Magnetic and electronic Co states in layered cobaltate GdBaCo2O5.5-x	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:M. Garcia-Fernandez, V. Scagnoli, U. Staub, A. M. Mulders, M. Janousch, Y. Bodenthin, D. Meister, B. D. Patterson, A. Mirone, Y. Tanaka, T. Nakamura, S. Grenier, Y. Huang, K.Conder	Abstract:  We have performed non-resonant x-ray diffraction, resonant soft and hard x-ray magnetic diffraction, soft x-ray absorption and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements to clarify the electronic and magnetic states of the Co3+ ions in GdBaCo2O5.5. Our data are consistent with a 3+ Py Co HS state at the pyramidal sites and a 3+ Oc Co LS state at the octahedral sites. The structural distortion, with a doubling of the a axis (2ap x 2ap x 2ap cell), shows alternating elongations and contractions of the pyramids and indicates that the metal-insulator transition is associated with orbital order in the t2g orbitals of the 3+ Py Co HS state. This distortion corresponds to an alternating ordering of xz and yz orbitals along the a and c axes for the 3+ Py Co . The orbital ordering and pyramidal distortion lead to deformation of the octahedra, but the 3+ Oc Co LS state does not allow an orbital order to occur for the 3+ Oc Co ions. The soft x-ray magnetic diffraction results indicate that the magnetic moments are aligned in the ab plane but are not parallel to the crystallographic a or b axes. The orbital order and the doubling of the magnetic unit cell along the c axis support a non-collinear magnetic structure. The x-ray magnetic circular dichroism data indicate that there is a large orbital magnetic contribution to the total ordered Co moment. 
0808.01682	General Sum Rules for WW Scattering in Higgsless Models: Equivalence Theorem and Deconstruction Identities	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:R. Sekhar Chivukula, Hong-Jian He, Masafumi Kurachi, Elizabeth H. Simmons, Masaharu Tanabashi	Abstract:  We analyze inelastic 2 to 2 scattering amplitudes for gauge bosons and Nambu-Goldstone bosons in deconstructed Higgsless models. Using the (KK) Equivalence Theorem in 4D (5D), we derive a set of general sum rules among the boson masses and multi-boson couplings that are valid for arbitrary deconstructed models. Taking the continuum limit, our results naturally include the 5D Higgsless model sum rules for arbitrary 5D geometry and boundary conditions; they also reduce to the elastic sum rules when applied to the special case of elastic scattering. For the case of linear deconstructed Higgsless models, we demonstrate that the sum rules can also be derived from a set of general deconstruction identities and completeness relations. We apply these sum rules to the deconstructed 3-site Higgsless model and its extensions; we show that in 5D ignoring all higher KK modes (n>1) is inconsistent once the inelastic channels become important. Finally, we discuss how our results generalize beyond the case of linear Higgsless models. 
0808.01683	On idempotent states on quantum groups	Quantum Algebra (math.QA)	Authors:Uwe Franz, Adam Skalski	Abstract:  Idempotent states on a compact quantum group are shown to yield group-like projections in the multiplier algebra of the dual discrete quantum group. This allows to deduce that every idempotent state on a finite quantum group arises in a canonical way as the Haar state on a finite quantum hypergroup. A natural order structure on the set of idempotent states is also studied and some examples discussed. 
0808.01684	Parkinson's Law Quantified: Three Investigations on Bureaucratic Inefficiency	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:Peter Klimek, Rudolf Hanel, Stefan Thurner	Abstract:  We formulate three famous, descriptive essays of C.N. Parkinson on bureaucratic inefficiency in a quantifiable and dynamical socio-physical framework. In the first model we show how the use of recent opinion formation models for small groups can be used to understand Parkinson's observation that decision making bodies such as cabinets or boards become highly inefficient once their size exceeds a critical 'Coefficient of Inefficiency', typically around 20. A second observation of Parkinson - which is sometimes referred to as Parkinson's Law - is that the growth of bureaucratic or administrative bodies usually goes hand in hand with a drastic decrease of its overall efficiency. In our second model we view a bureaucratic body as a system of a flow of workers, which enter, become promoted to various internal levels within the system over time, and leave the system after having served for a certain time. Promotion usually is associated with an increase of subordinates. Within the proposed model it becomes possible to work out the phase diagram under which conditions bureaucratic growth can be confined. In our last model we assign individual efficiency curves to workers throughout their life in administration, and compute the optimum time to send them to old age pension, in order to ensure a maximum of efficiency within the body - in Parkinson's words we compute the 'Pension Point'. 
0808.01685	Nuclear Magnetism and Electronic Order in 13C Nanotubes	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Bernd Braunecker, Pascal Simon, Daniel Loss	Abstract:  Single wall carbon nanotubes grown entirely from 13-C form an ideal system to study the effect of electron interaction on nuclear magnetism in one dimension. If the electrons are in the metallic, Luttinger liquid regime, we show that even a very weak hyperfine coupling to the 13-C nuclear spins has a striking effect: The system is driven into an ordered phase, which combines electron and nuclear degrees of freedom, and which persists up into the millikelvin range. In this phase the conductance is reduced by a universal factor of 2, allowing for detection by standard transport experiments. 
0808.01686	Bundles of coloured posets and a Leray-Serre spectral sequence for Khovanov homology	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Brent Everitt, Paul Turner	Abstract:  The decorated hypercube found in the construction of Khovanov homology for links is an example of a Boolean lattice equipped with a presheaf of modules. One can place this in a wider setting as an example of a coloured poset, that is to say a poset with a unique maximal element equipped with a presheaf of modules. In this paper we initiate the study of a bundle theory for coloured posets, producing for a certain class of base posets a Leray-Serre type spectral sequence. We then show how this theory finds application in Khovanov homology by producing a new spectral sequence converging to the Khovanov homology of a given link. 
0808.01687	The Lanczos potential and Chern-Simons theory	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Mark D. Roberts	Abstract:  A new tensor $D$ is introduced which is constructed from the Lanczos potential and is of the same form as that of the Weyl tensor $C$ expressed in terms of the Lanczos potential except that covariant differentiation is replaced by transvection with a vector $v$. The new tensor has associated invariants $C\cdot D$ and $D^2$, the first of these can be interpreted as a Chern-Simons term for Weyl $C^2$ gravity. Both invariants allow various tensors to be constructed and some of the properties of these are investigated by using exact examples. 
0808.01688	Describing all bi-orderings on Thompson's group F	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Andrés Navas, Cristóbal Rivas	Abstract:  We describe all possible ways of bi-ordering Thompson group F: its space of bi-orderings is made up of eight isolated points and four canonical copies of the Cantor set. 
0808.01689	Transverse momentum spectra of charged hadrons in jets at the Tevatron	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Redamy Perez Ramos	Abstract:  The hadronic $\kt$-spectrum inside a high energy jet is determined including corrections of relative magnitude $\cO{\sqrt{α_s}}$ with respect to the Modified Leading Logarithmic Approximation (MLLA), in the limiting spectrum approximation (assuming an infrared cut-off $Q_0 =\lqcd$) and beyond ($Q_0\ne\lqcd$). The results in the limiting spectrum approximation are found to be, after normalization, in impressive agreement with measurements by the CDF collaboration. A new integral representation for the "hump-backed" plateau is also reported. 
0808.01690	Statistical properties of one-dimensional random lasers	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Oleg Zaitsev, Lev Deych, Vladimir Shuvayev	Abstract:  Statistical properties of a laser based on a one-dimensional disordered superlattice open at one side are studied numerically. The passive normal modes of the system are determined using the Feshbach projection technique. It is found that the mode competition due to the spacial hole burning leads to a saturation of the number of lasing modes with increasing pump rate. It is also responsible for nonmonotonic dependence of intensities of lasing modes as functions of pumping. Computed distributions of spectral spacing and intensity statistics are in qualitative agreement with experimental results. 
0808.01691	Hybrid Pomeron Model of exclusive central diffractive production	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:R. Peschanski, M. Rangel, C. Royon	Abstract:  Central diffractive production of heavy states (massive dijets, Higgs boson) is studied in the exclusive mode using a new Hybrid Pomeron Model (HPM). Built from Hybrid Pomerons defined by the combination of one hard and one soft color exchanges, the model describes well the centrally produced diffractive dijet data at the Tevatron. Predictions for the Higgs boson and dijet exclusive production at the LHC are presented. 
0808.01692	Semiflexible Chains in Confined Spaces	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Greg Morrison, D. Thirumalai	Abstract:  We develop an analytical method for studying the properties of a non-interacting Wormlike Chain (WLC) in confined geometries. The mean field-like theory replaces the rigid constraints of confinement with average constraints, thus allowing us to develop a tractable method for treating a WLC wrapped on the surface of a sphere, and fully encapsulated within it. The efficacy of the theory is established by reproducing the exact correlation functions for a WLC confined to the surface of a sphere. In addition, the coefficients in the free energy are exactly calculated. We also describe the behavior of a surface-confined chain under external tension that is relevant for single molecule experiments on histone-DNA complexes. The force-extension curves display spatial oscillations, and the extension of the chain, whose maximum value is bounded by the sphere diameter, scales as $f^{-1}$ at large forces, in contrast to the unconfined chain that approaches the contour length as $f^{-1/2}$. A WLC encapsulated in a sphere, that is relevant for the study of the viral encapsulation of DNA, can also be treated using the MF approach. The predictions of the theory for various correlation functions are in excellent agreement with Langevin simulations. We find that strongly confined chains are highly structured by examining the correlations using a local winding axis. The predicted pressure of the system is in excellent agreement with simulations but, as is known, is significantly lower than the pressures seen for DNA packaged in viral capsids. 
0808.01693	The spontaneous breaking of a metastable string	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:A. Monin, M.B. Voloshin	Abstract:  We consider the phase transition of a string with tension $\eps_1$ to a string with a smaller tension $\eps_2$. The transition proceeds through quantum tunneling, and we calculate in arbitrary number of dimensions the pre-exponential factor multiplying the leading semiclassical exponential expression for the rate of the process. At $\eps_2=0$ the found formula for the decay rate also describes a break up of a metastable string into two pieces. 
0808.01694	Superconductivity in SrNi2As2 Single Crystals	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:E.D. Bauer, F. Ronning, B.L. Scott, J.D. Thompson (LANL)    	Abstract:  The electrical resistivity ρ(T) and heat capacity C(T) on single crystals of SrNi2As2 and EuNi2As2 are reported. While there is no evidence for a structural transition in either compound, SrNi2As2 is found to be a bulk superconductor at T_c=0.62 K with a Sommerfeld coefficient of γ= 8.7 mJ/mol K^2 and a small upper critical field H_{c2} \sim 200 Oe. No superconductivity was found in EuNi2As2 above 0.4 K, but anomalies in ρand C reveal that magnetic order associated with the Eu^{2+} magnetic moments occurs at T_m = 14 K. 
0808.01695	Extended flux maps on surfaces and the contracted Johnson homomorphism	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Matthew B. Day	Abstract:  On a closed symplectic surface Sigma of genus two or more, we give a new construction of an extended flux map (a crossed homomorphism from the symplectomorphism group Symp(Sigma) to the cohomology group H^1(Sigma;R) that extends the flux homomorphism). This construction uses the topology of the Jacobian of the surface and a correction factor related to the Johnson homomorphism. For surfaces of genus three or more, we give another new construction of an extended flux map using hyperbolic geometry. 
0808.01696	Warped polar ring in the Arp 212 galaxy	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A.V. Moiseev (Special Astrophysical Observatory, Russia)    	Abstract:  The Fabry-Perot scanning interferometer mounted on the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences is used to study the distribution and kinematics of ionized gas in the peculiar galaxy Arp 212 (NGC 7625, III Zw 102). Two kinematically distinct subsystems - the inner disk and outer emission filaments, are found within the optical radius of the galaxy. The first subsystem, at galactocentric distances r<3.5 kpc, rotates in the plane of the stellar disk. The inner part of the ionized-gas disk (r<1.5-2 kpc) exactly coincides with the previously known disk consisting of molecular gas. The second subsystem of ionized gas is located at galactocentric distances 2-6 kpc. This subsystem rotates in a plane tilted by a significant angle to the stellar disk. The angle of orbital inclination in the outer disk increases with galactocentric distance and reaches 50 degrees at r=6 kpc. The ionized fraction of the gaseous disk does not show up beyond this galactocentric distance, but we believe that the HI disk continues to warp and approaches the plane that is polar with respect to the inner disk of the galaxy. Hence Arp 212 can be classified as a galaxy with a polar ring (or a polar disk). The observed kinematics of the ionized and neutral gas can be explained assuming that the distribution of gravitational potential in the galaxy is not spherically symmetric. Most probably, the polar ring have formed via accretion of gas from the dwarf satellite galaxy UGC 12549. 
0808.01697	Spin fluctuations, magnetic long-range order and Fermi surface gapping in NaxCoO2	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:T. F. Schulze (1), M. Bruehwiler (1), P. S. Haefliger (1), S. M. Kazakov (1), Ch. Niedermayer (2), K. Mattenberger (1), J. Karpinski (1), B. Batlogg (1) ((1) Laboratory for Solid State Physics, ETH Zurich, Switzerland, (2) Laboratory for Neutron Scattering, Paul-Scherrer-Institut (PSI) and ETH Zurich, Switzerland)    	Abstract:  In this study an extended low energy phase diagram for NaxCoO2 is experimentally established with emphasis on the high x range. It is based on systematic heat capacity studies on both polycrystalline and single crystalline samples and on uSR measurements. Main features are the existence of mass enhancement, spin fluctuations without long-range order, and magnetic order with associated Fermi surface gapping. The latter is seen in the electronic density of states (DOS) and suppression of nuclear specific heat. While there is agreement between the band structure and the low energy DOS in the low x range, in the high x range (x > 0.6) the thermodynamically determined DOS is approximately three times that deduced from the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)-measured band dispersion or local-density approximation (LDA) calculations. 
0808.01698	Regularisation as a quantised low-pass filter	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:L I Plimak	Abstract:  A divergence-free approach to relativistic quantum electrodynamics based on regularisation of equations of quantum mechanics is discussed. This approach is shown to be exactly equivalent to the conventional Feynman-Dyson renormalisation techniques. 
0808.01699	Effect of c(2x2)-CO overlayer on the phonons of Cu(001): a first principles study	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Marisol Alcántara Ortigoza, Rolf Heid, Klaus-Peter Bohnen, Talat S. Rahman	Abstract:  We have examined the effect of a c(2x2) overlayer of CO on the surface phonons of the substrate, Cu(001), by applying the density functional perturbation theory with both the local (LDA) and the generalized-gradient (GGA) density approximations, through the Hedin-Lundqvist and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functionals, respectively. Our results (GGA) trace the Rayleigh wave softening detected by helium atom scattering (HAS) experiments to changes in the force constants between the substrate surface atoms brought about by CO chemisorption, resolving an ongoing debate on the subject. The calculated surface phonon dispersion curves document the changes in the polarization of some modes and show those of the modes originally along the $\bar{Y}$ direction of the clean surface Brillouin zone (SBZ) which are back-folded along the $\barΔ$ direction of the chemisorbed SBZ, to be particularly consequential. The vertical and shear horizontal section of $S_1$ in the SBZ of the clean surface, for example, is back-folded as a longitudinal-vertical mode, indicating thereby that $S_1$ $-$ predicted a long time back along $\barΔ$ for the clean surface $-$ may be indirectly assessed at $\bar{X}$ upon CO adsorption by standard planar scattering techniques. These findings further suggest that some of the energy losses detected by HAS along $\barΔ$, which were associated to multiphonon excitations of the adlayer frustrated translation mode, may actually correspond to the back-folded substrate surface modes. 
0808.01700	Conservative discrete time-invariant systems and block operator CMV matrices	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Yury Arlinskii	Abstract:  It is well known that an operator-valued function $Θ$ from the Schur class ${\bf S}(\mathfrak M,\mathfrak N)$, where $\mathfrak M$ and $\mathfrak N$ are separable Hilbert spaces, can be realized as the transfer function of a simple conservative discrete time-invariant linear system. The known realizations involve the function $Θ$ itself, the Hardy spaces or the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. On the other hand, as in the classical scalar case, the Schur class operator-valued function is uniquely determined by its so called "Schur parameters". In this paper we construct simple conservative realizations using the Schur parameters only. It turns out that the unitary operators corresponding to the systems take the form of five diagonal block operator matrices, which are the analogs of Cantero--Moral--Velázquez (CMV) matrices appeared recently in the theory of scalar orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. We obtain new models given by truncated block operator CMV matrices for an arbitrary completely non-unitary contraction. It is shown that the minimal unitary dilations of a contraction in a Hilbert space and the minimal Naimark dilations of a semi-spectral operator measure on the unit circle can also be expressed by means of block operator CMV matrices. 
0808.01701	Planetary Bow Shocks	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:R. A. Treumann, C. H. Jaroschek	Abstract:  Our present knowledge of the properties of the various planetary bow shocks is briefly reviewed. We do not follow the astronomical ordering of the planets. We rather distinguish between magnetised and unmagnetised planets which groups Mercury and Earth with the outer giant planets of the solar system, Mars and Moon in a separate group lacking magnetic fields and dense atmospheres, and Venus together with the comets as the atmospheric celestial objects exposed to the solar wind. Asteroids would, in this classification, fall into the group together with the Moon and should behave similarly though being much smaller. Extrasolar planets are not considered as we have only remote information about their behaviour. The presentation is brief in the sense that our in situ knowledge is rather sporadic yet, depending on just a countable number of bow shock crossings from which just some basic conclusions can be drawn about size, stationarity, shape and nature of the respective shock. The only bow shock of which we have sufficient information to deal in sufficient depth with its physics is Earth's bow shock. This has been reviewed in other places in this volume and therefore is mentioned here only as the bow shock paradigm in passing. 
0808.01702	Minimally Allowed Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay Rates Within an Anarchical Framework	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:James Jenkins	Abstract:  Neutrinoless double beta decay is the only realistic probe of the Majorana nature of the neutrino. In the standard picture, its rate is proportional to $m_{ee}$, the e-e element of the Majorana neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis. I explore minimally allowed $m_{ee}$ values within the framework of mass matrix anarchy where neutrino parameters are defined statistically at low energies. Distributions of mixing angles are well defined by the Haar integration measure, but masses are dependent on arbitrary weighting functions and boundary conditions. I survey the integration measure parameter space and find that for sufficiently convergent weightings, $m_{ee}$ is constrained between (0.01-0.4) eV at 90% confidence. Constraints from neutrino mixing data lower these bounds. Singular integration measures allow for arbitrarily small $m_{ee}$ values with the remaining elements ill-defined, but this condition constrains the flavor structure of the model's ultraviolet completion. Bounds below $m_{ee} \sim 5\times10^{-3}$ eV should indicate symmetry in the lepton sector, new light degrees of freedom or the Dirac nature of the neutrino. 
0808.01703	Raman Coupling of Zeeman Sublevels in an Alkali Bose Condensate	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:K. C. Wright, L. S. Leslie, N. P. Bigelow	Abstract:  We investigate amplitude and phase control of the components of the spinor order parameter of a 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate. By modeling the interaction of the multilevel atomic system with a pair of Raman-detuned laser pulses, we show that it is possible to construct a pulse-sequence protocol for producing a desired state change within a single Zeeman manifold. We present several successful elementary tests of this protocol in both the F = 1 and F = 2 Zeeman manifolds of 87Rb using the D1 transitions. We describe specific features of the interaction which are important for multimode, spatially-varying field configurations, including the role of state-dependent, light-induced potentials. 
0808.01704	Renormalized 2PN spin contributions to the accumulated orbital phase for LISA sources	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:László Á. Gergely, Balázs Mikóczi	Abstract:  We give here a new third post-Newtonisn (3PN) spin-spin contribution (in the PN parameter $ε$) to the accumulated orbital phase of a compact binary, arising from the spin-orbit precessional motion of the spins. In the equal mass case this contribution vanishes, but LISA sources of merging supermassive binary black holes have typically a mass ratio of 1:10. For such non-equal masses this 3PN correction is periodic in time, with period approximately $ε^{-1}$ times larger than the period of gravitational waves. We derive a renormalized and simpler expression of the spin-spin coefficient at 2PN, as an average over the time-scale of this period of the combined 2PN and 3PN contribution. We also find that for LISA sources the quadrupole-monopole contribution to the phase dominates over the spin-spin contribution, while the self-spin contribution is negligible even for the dominant spin. Finally we define a renormalized total spin coefficient $\barσ$ to be employed in the search for gravitational waves emitted by LISA sources. 
0808.01705	Meson formfactor scheme for the chiral Lagrangian approach to J/psi breakup cross sections motivated by a relativistic quark model	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:D. B. Blaschke, H. Grigorian, Yu. L. Kalinovsky	Abstract:  We suggest a new scheme for the introduction of formfactors for the SU(4) chiral meson Lagrangian approach to the J/psi breakup cross sections by pion and rho meson impact. This mesonic formfactor scheme respects the fact that on the quark level of description the contact and the meson exchange diagrams are constructed by so-called box and triangle diagrams which contain a different number of vertex functions for the quark-meson coupling. We present a model calculation for Gaussian vertex functions within the meson formfactor scheme and compare the results with those of the usual global formfactor model. We calibrate the new meson formfactor model with results for the pion impact processes from a relativistic quark model calculation by Ivanov et al. and present predictions for the rho-meson induced processes. We provide a fit formula for the resulting energy-dependent cross sections. 
0808.01706	Anisotropy and Magnetism in the LSDA+U Method	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Erik R. Ylvisaker, Warren E. Pickett, Klaus Koepernik	Abstract:  Consequences of anisotropy (variation of orbital occupation) and magnetism, and their coupling, are analyzed for LSDA+U functionals, both the commonly used ones as well as less commonly applied functionals. After reviewing and extending some earlier observations for an isotropic interaction, the anisotropies are examined more fully and related to use with the local density (LDA) or local spin density (LSDA) approximations. The total energies of all possible integer configurations of an open $f$ shell are presented for three functionals, where some differences are found to be dramatic. Differences in how the commonly used "around mean field" (AMF) and "fully localized limit" (FLL) functionals perform are traced to such differences. The LSDA+U interaction term, applied self-consistently, usually enhances spin magnetic moments and orbital polarization, and the double-counting terms of both functionals provide an opposing, moderating tendency ("suppressing the magnetic moment"). The AMF double counting term gives magnetic states a significantly larger energy penalty than does the FLL counterpart. 
0808.01707	CP violation in tau -> K pi pi nu_tau	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Ken Kiers, Kevin Little, Alakabha Datta, David London, Makiko Nagashima, Alejandro Szynkman	Abstract:  We consider CP-violating effects in tau->K pi pi nu_tau, assuming that a charged Higgs boson provides a new amplitude that can interfere with the usual Standard Model amplitude. We consider four CP-odd observables -- the regular rate asymmetry, two modified rate asymmetries and a triple-product asymmetry. The regular rate asymmetry is expected to be small because it requires the interference of the new physics amplitude with the standard model amplitude containing the hadronic scalar form factor. The other CP asymmetries may be more promising in terms of their new physics reach. Numerical estimates indicate that the maximum obtainable values for the modified and triple-product asymmetries are on the order of a percent. 
0808.01708	Random Loose Packing in Granular Matter	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:David Aristoff, Charles Radin	Abstract:  We introduce and simulate a two dimensional probabilistic model of granular matter at vanishing pressure. The model exhibits a perfectly sharp random loose packing density, a phenomenon that should be verifiable for real granular matter. 
0808.01709	The causal structure of dynamical charged black holes	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Sungwook E. Hong, Dong-il Hwang, Ewan D. Stewart, Dong-han Yeom	Abstract:  We study the causal structure of dynamical charged black holes, with a sufficient number of massless fields, using numerical simulations. Neglecting Hawking radiation, the inner horizon is a null Cauchy horizon and a curvature singularity due to mass inflation. When we include Hawking radiation, the inner horizon becomes space-like and is separated from the Cauchy horizon, which is parallel to the out-going null direction. Since a charged black hole must eventually transit to a neutral black hole, we studied the neutralization of the black hole and observed that the inner horizon evolves into a space-like singularity, generating a Cauchy horizon which is parallel to the in-going null direction. Since the mass function is finite around the inner horizon, the inner horizon is regular and penetrable in a general relativistic sense. However, since the curvature functions become trans-Planckian, we cannot saymore about the region beyond the inner horizon, and it is natural to say that there is a 'physical' space-like singularity. However, if we assume an exponentially large number of massless scalar fields, our results can be extended beyond the inner horizon. In this case, strong cosmic censorship and black hole complementarity can be violated. 
0808.01710	Dynamic modeling of mean-reverting spreads for statistical arbitrage	Statistical Finance (q-fin.ST)	Authors:Kostas Triantafyllopoulos, Giovanni Montana	Abstract:  Statistical arbitrage strategies, such as pairs trading and its generalizations, rely on the construction of mean-reverting spreads enjoying a certain degree of predictability. Gaussian linear state-space processes have recently been proposed as a model for such spreads under the assumption that the observed process is a noisy realization of some hidden states. Real-time estimation of the unobserved spread process can reveal temporary market inefficiencies which can then be exploited to generate excess returns. Building on previous work, we embrace the state-space framework for modeling spread processes and extend this methodology along three different directions. First, we introduce time-dependency in the model parameters, which allows for quick adaptation to changes in the data generating process. Second, we provide an on-line estimation algorithm that can be constantly run in real-time. Being computationally fast, the algorithm is particularly suitable for building aggressive trading strategies based on high-frequency data and may be used as a monitoring device for mean-reversion. Finally, our framework naturally provides informative uncertainty measures of all the estimated parameters. Experimental results based on Monte Carlo simulations and historical equity data are discussed, including a co-integration relationship involving two exchange-traded funds. 
0808.01711	Analytic continuation in mapping spaces	Complex Variables (math.CV)	Authors:Laszlo Lempert	Abstract:  We consider a Stein manifold $M$ of dimension $\geq 2$ and a compact subset $K\subset M$ such that $M'=M\backslash K$ is connected. Let $S$ be a compact differential manifold, and let $M_S$, resp. $M'_S$ stand for the complex manifold of maps $S\to M$, resp. $S\to M'$, of some specified regularity, that are homotopic to constant. We prove that any holomorphic function on $M'_S$ continues analytically to $M_S$ (perhaps as a multivalued function). 
0808.01712	Electrical Control of Exchange Bias Mediated by Graphene	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Y. G. Semenov, J. M. Zavada, K. W. Kim	Abstract:  The role of graphene in mediating the exchange interaction is theoretically investigated when it is placed between two ferromagnetic dielectric materials. The calculation based on a tight-binding model illustrates that the magnetic interactions at the interfaces affect not only the graphene band structure but also the thermodynamic potential of the system. This induces an indirect exchange interaction between the magnetic layers that can be considered in term of an effective exchange bias field. The analysis clearly indicates a strong dependence of the effective exchange bias on the properties of the mediating layer, revealing an effective mechanism of electrical control even at room temperature. This dependence also results in qualitatively different characteristics for the cases involving mono- and bilayer graphene. 
0808.01713	Loose Hamilton cycles in hypergraphs	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Peter Keevash, Daniela Kühn, Richard Mycroft, Deryk Osthus	Abstract:  We prove that any k-uniform hypergraph on n vertices with minimum degree at least n/(2(k-1))+o(n) contains a loose Hamilton cycle. The proof strategy is similar to that used by Kühn and Osthus for the 3-uniform case. Though some additional difficulties arise in the k-uniform case, our argument here is considerably simplified by applying the recent hypergraph blow-up lemma of Keevash. 
0808.01714	On the G_2 bundle of a Riemannian 4-manifold	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Rui Albuquerque	Abstract:  We study the natural G_2 structure on the unit tangent sphere bundle SM of any given orientable Riemannian 4-manifold M, as it was discovered in \cite{AlbSal}. A name is proposed for the space. We work in the context of metric connections, or so called geometry with torsion, and describe the components of the torsion of the connection which imply certain equations of the G_2 structure. This article is devoted to finding the G_2-torsion tensors which classify our structure according to the theory in \cite{FerGray}. 
0808.01715	Curvature effect on the interaction between folded graphitic surface and silver clusters	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:A. F. Kemper, H-P. Cheng, N. Kébaïli, S. Benrezzak, M. Schmidt, A. Masson, C. Bréchignac	Abstract:  Evidence of curvature effects on the interaction and binding of silver clusters on folded graphitic surfaces has been shown from both experiment and theory. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations within the local density and generalized gradient approximations have been performed for the structural relaxation of both Ag and Ag$_2$ on curved surfaces, showing a cross-over from quantum to classical behaviour. Using Lennard-Jones potential to model the interaction between a single cluster and the graphene surface, evidence is found for the curvature effect on the binding of silver nano-particles to folding graphitic surfaces. The theoretical results are compared to SEM and AFM images of samples obtained from pre-formed silver cluster deposition on carboneous substrates exhibiting anisotropic pleat structures. 
0808.01716	Rapidly Rotating Suns and Active Nests of Convection	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Benjamin P. Brown (1), Matthew K. Browning (2), Allan Sacha Brun (3), Mark S. Miesch (4), Juri Toomre (1) ((1) JILA and Dept. Astrophysical & Planetary Sciences, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO; (2) Dept. of Astronomy, University of California, Berkeley, CA; (3) DSM/IRFU/SAp, CEA-Saclay & UMR AIM, CEA-CNRS-Universite Paris 7, Gif-sur-Yvette, France; (4) High Altitude Observatory, NCAR, Boulder, CO)    	Abstract:  In the solar convection zone, rotation couples with intensely turbulent convection to drive a strong differential rotation and achieve complex magnetic dynamo action. Our sun must have rotated more rapidly in its past, as is suggested by observations of many rapidly rotating young solar-type stars. Here we explore the effects of more rapid rotation on the global-scale patterns of convection in such stars and the flows of differential rotation and meridional circulation which are self-consistently established. The convection in these systems is richly time dependent and in our most rapidly rotating suns a striking pattern of localized convection emerges. Convection near the equator in these systems is dominated by one or two nests in longitude of locally enhanced convection, with quiescent streaming flow in between at the highest rotation rates. These active nests of convection maintain a strong differential rotation despite their small size. The structure of differential rotation is similar in all of our more rapidly rotating suns, with fast equators and slower poles. We find that the total shear in differential rotation Delta Omega grows with more rapid rotation while the relative shear Delta Omega/Omega_0 decreases. In contrast, at more rapid rotation the meridional circulations decrease in energy and peak velocities and break into multiple cells of circulation in both radius and latitude. 
0808.01717	Coherent sheaves and cohesive sheaves	Complex Variables (math.CV)	Authors:Laszlo Lempert	Abstract:  We consider coherent and cohesive sheaves of $\cO$--modules over open sets $Ω\subset\bC^n$. We prove that coherent sheaves, and certain other sheaves derived from them, are cohesive; and conversely, certain sheaves derived from cohesive sheaves are coherent. An important tool in all this, also proved here, is that the sheaf of Banach space valued holomorphic germs is flat.

This instrument uses multiple charge detectors and a transition radiation detector to provide the first high accuracy measurements of the relative abundances of elements from boron to oxygen up to energies around 1 TeV/n. The data agree with previous measurements at lower energies and show a relatively steep decline (~E$^-0.6$ to E$^-0.5$) at high energies. They further show the source abundance of nitrogen relative to oxygen is ~10% in the TeV/n region. 
0808.01719	A Probable New Globular Cluster in the Galactic Disk	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jay Strader (CfA), Henry A. Kobulnicky (Wyoming)    	Abstract:  We report the discovery of a probable new globular cluster in the disk of the Milky Way. Visible in 2MASS and the GLIMPSE survey, it has an estimated foreground extinction of A_V ~ 24 mag. The absolute magnitude of the cluster and the luminosity function of the red giant branch are most consistent with that of an old globular cluster with a mass of a few times 10^5 solar masses at a distance of 4-8 kpc. 
0808.01720	Recursion Relations, Generating Functions, and Unitarity Sums in N=4 SYM Theory	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Henriette Elvang, Daniel Z. Freedman, Michael Kiermaier	Abstract:  We prove that the MHV vertex expansion is valid for any NMHV tree amplitude of N=4 SYM. The proof uses induction to show that there always exists a complex deformation of three external momenta such that the amplitude falls off at least as fast as 1/z for large z. This validates the generating function for n-point NMHV tree amplitudes. We also develop generating functions for anti-MHV and anti-NMHV amplitudes. As an application, we use these generating functions to evaluate several examples of intermediate state sums on unitarity cuts of 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-loop amplitudes. In a separate analysis, we extend the recent results of arXiv:0808.0504 to prove that there exists a valid 2-line shift for any n-point tree amplitude of N=4 SYM. This implies that there is a BCFW recursion relation for any tree amplitude of the theory. 
0808.01721	Initial Results on the F-logic to OWL Bi-directional Translation on a Tabled Prolog Engine	Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)	Authors:Paul Fodor	Abstract:  In this paper, we show our results on the bi-directional data exchange between the F-logic language supported by the Flora2 system and the OWL language. Most of the TBox and ABox axioms are translated preserving the semantics between the two representations, such as: proper inclusion, individual definition, functional properties, while some axioms and restrictions require a change in the semantics, such as: numbered and qualified cardinality restrictions. For the second case, we translate the OWL definite style inference rules into F-logic style constraints. We also describe a set of reasoning examples using the above translation, including the reasoning in Flora2 of a variety of ABox queries. 
0808.01722	Broadband Radiation from Primary Electrons in Very Energetic Supernovae	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Shin'ichiro Ando (Caltech), Peter Meszaros (Penn State)    	Abstract:  A class of very energetic supernovae (hypernovae) is associated with long gamma-ray bursts, in particular with a less energetic but more frequent population of gamma-ray bursts. Hypernovae also appear to be associated with mildly relativistic jets or outflows, even in the absence of gamma-ray bursts. Here we consider radiation from charged particles accelerated in such mildly relativistic outflows with kinetic energies of ~10^{50} erg. The radiation processes of the primarily accelerated electrons considered are synchrotron radiation and inverse-Compton scattering of synchrotron photons (synchrotron self-Compton; SSC) and of supernova photons (external inverse-Compton; EIC). In the soft X-ray regime, both the SSC and EIC flux can be the dominant component, but due to their very different spectral shapes it should be easy to distinguish between them. When the fraction of the kinetic energy going into the electrons (ε_e) is large, the SSC is expected to be important; otherwise the EIC will dominate. The EIC flux is quite high, almost independently of ε_e, providing a good target for X-ray telescopes such as XMM-Newton and Chandra. In the GeV gamma-ray regime, the EIC would be the dominant radiation process and the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) should be able to probe the value of ε_e, the spectrum of the electrons, and their maximum acceleration energy. Accelerated protons also lead to photon radiation through the secondary electrons produced by the photopion and photopair processes. We find that over a significant range of parameters the proton component is generally less prominent than the primary electron component. We discuss the prospects for the detection of the X-ray and GeV signatures of the mildly relativistic outflow of hypernovae. 
0808.01723	Corner Junction as a Probe of Helical Edge States	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Chang-Yu Hou, Eun-Ah Kim, Claudio Chamon	Abstract:  We propose and analyze inter-edge tunneling in a quantum spin Hall corner junction as a means to probe the helical nature of the edge states. We show that electron-electron interactions in the one-dimensional helical edge states result in Luttinger parameters for spin and charge that are intertwined, and thus rather different than those for a quantum wire with spin rotation invariance. Consequently, we find that the four-terminal conductance in a corner junction has a distinctive form that could be used as evidence for the helical nature of the edge states. 
0808.01724	Non-linear Redshift-Space Power Spectra	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. Richard Shaw, Antony Lewis	Abstract:  Distances in cosmology are usually inferred from observed redshifts - an estimate that is dependent on the local peculiar motion - giving a distorted view of the three dimensional structure and affecting basic observables such as the correlation function and power spectrum. We calculate the full non-linear redshift-space power spectrum for Gaussian fields, giving results for both the standard flat sky approximation and the directly-observable angular correlation function and angular power spectrum. Coupling between large and small scale modes boosts the power on small scales when the perturbations are small. On larger scales power is slightly suppressed by the velocities perturbations on smaller scales. The analysis is general, but we comment specifically on the implications for future high-redshift observations, and show that the non-linear spectrum has significantly more complicated angular structure than in linear theory. We comment on the implications for using the angular structure to separate cosmological and astrophysical components of 21 cm observations. 
0808.01725	Gravity Duals of Lifshitz-like Fixed Points	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Shamit Kachru, Xiao Liu, Michael Mulligan	Abstract:  We find candidate macroscopic gravity duals for scale-invariant but non-Lorentz invariant fixed points, which do not have particle number as a conserved quantity. We compute two-point correlation functions which exhibit novel behavior relative to their AdS counterparts, and find holographic renormalization group flows to conformal field theories. Our theories are characterized by a dynamical critical exponent $z$, which governs the anisotropy between spatial and temporal scaling $t \to λ^z t$, $x \to λx$; we focus on the case with $z=2$. Such theories describe multicritical points in certain magnetic materials and liquid crystals, and have been shown to arise at quantum critical points in toy models of the cuprate superconductors. This work can be considered a small step towards making useful dual descriptions of such critical points. 
0808.01726	X-Ray Emission from a Supermassive Black Hole Ejected from the Center of a Galaxy	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yutaka Fujita (Osaka U.)    	Abstract:  Recent studies have indicated that the emission of gravitational waves at the merger of two black holes gives a kick to the final black hole. If the supermassive black hole at the center of a disk galaxy is kicked but the velocity is not large enough to escape from the host galaxy, it will fall back onto the the disk and accrete the interstellar medium in the disk. We study the X-ray emission from the black holes with masses of ~10^7 M_sun recoiled from the galactic center with velocities of ~600 km s^-1. We find that their luminosities can reach ~>10^39 erg s^-1, when they pass the apastrons in the disk. While the X-ray luminosities are comparable to those of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) observed in disk galaxies, ULXs observed so far do not seem to be such supermassive black holes. Statical studies could constrain the probability of merger and recoil of supermassive black holes. 
0808.01727	Mapping the Dark Matter From UV Light at High Redshift: An Empirical Approach to Understand Galaxy Statistics	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:K.-S. Lee, M. Giavalisco, C. Conroy, R. H. Wechsler, H. C. Ferguson, R. S. Somerville, M. E. Dickinson, C. M. Urry	Abstract:  We present a simple formalism to interpret two galaxy statistics, the UV luminosity function and two-point correlation functions for star-forming galaxies at z~4, 5, 6 in the context of LCDM cosmology. Both statistics are the result of how star formation takes place in DM halos, and thus are used to constrain how UV light depends on halo properties such as mass. The two measures were taken from the GOODS data, thus ideal for joint analysis. The two physical quantities we explore are the SF duty cycle, and the range of L_UV that a halo of mass M can have (mean and variance). The former addresses the typical duration of SF activity in halos while the latter addresses the averaged SF history and regularity of gas inflow into these systems. We explore various physical models consistent with data, and find the following: 1) the typical duration of SF observed in the data is <0.4 Gyr (1 sig), 2) the inferred scaling law between L_UV and halo mass M from the observed slope of the LFs is roughly linear at all redshifts, and 3) L_UV for a fixed halo mass decreases with time, implying that the SF efficiency (after dust extinction) is higher at earlier times. We explore several physical scenarios relating star formation to halo mass, but find that these scenarios are indistinguishable due to the limited range of halo mass probed by our data. In order to discriminate between different scenarios, we discuss constraining the bright-faint galaxy cross-correlation functions and luminosity-dependence of galaxy bias. (Abridged) 
0808.01728	A Tale of Two Herbig Ae stars -MWC275 and AB Aurigae: Comprehensive Models for SED and Interferometry	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Tannirkulam, J. D. Monnier, T. J. Harries, R. Millan-Gabet, Z. Zhu, E. Pedretti, M. Ireland, P. Tuthill, T. ten Brummelaar, H. McAlister, C. Farrington, P.J. Goldfinger, J. Sturmann, L. Sturmann, N. Turner	Abstract:  We present comprehensive models for the Herbig Ae stars MWC275 and AB Aur that aim to explain their spectral energy distribution (from UV to millimeter) and long baseline interferometry (from near-infrared to millimeter) simultaneously. Data from the literature, combined with new mid-infrared (MIR) interferometry from the Keck Segment Tilting Experiment, are modeled using an axisymmetric Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. Models in which most of the near-infrared (NIR) emission arises from a dust rim fail to fit the NIR spectral energy distribution (SED) and sub-milli-arcsecond NIR CHARA interferometry. Following recent work, we include an additional gas emission component with similar size scale to the dust rim, inside the sublimation radius, to fit the NIR SED and long-baseline NIR interferometry on MWC275 and AB Aur. In the absence of shielding of star light by gas, we show that the gas-dust transition region in these YSOs will have to contain highly refractory dust, sublimating at ~1850K. Despite having nearly identical structure in the thermal NIR, the outer disks of MWC275 and AB Aur differ substantially. In contrast to the AB Aur disk, MWC275 lacks small grains in the disk atmosphere capable of producing significant 10-20micron emission beyond ~7AU, forcing the outer regions into the "shadow" of the inner disk 
0808.01729	Dark Scalar Doublets and Neutrino Tribimaximal Mixing from A_4 Symmetry	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Ernest Ma (UC Riverside)    	Abstract:  In the context of A_4 symmetry, neutrino tribimaximal mixing is achieved through the breaking of A_4 to Z_3 (Z_2) in the charged-lepton (neutrino) sector respectively. The implied vacuum misalignment of the (1,1,1) and (1,0,0) directions in A_4 space is a difficult technical problem, and cannot be treated without many auxiliary fields and symmetries (and perhaps extra dimensions). It is pointed out here that an alternative scenario exists with A_4 alone and no redundant fields, if neutrino masses are "scotogenic", i.e. radiatively induced by dark scalar doublets as recently proposed. 
0808.01730	Unambiguous modification of nonorthogonal single and two photon polarization states	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:F.A. Torres-Ruiz, J. Aguirre, A. Delgado, L. Neves, G. Lima, S. Pádua, L. Roa, C. Saavedra	Abstract:  In this work we propose a probabilistic method which allows an unambiguous modification of two non-orthogonal quantum states. We experimentally implement this protocol by using two-photon polarization states generated in the process of spontaneous parametric down conversion. In the experiment, for codifying initial quantum states, we consider single photon states and heralded detection. We show that the application of this protocol to entangled states, it allows a fine control of the amount of entanglement of the initial state. 
0808.01731	Generalized Polar Decompositions for Closed Operators in Hilbert Spaces and Some Applications	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Fritz Gesztesy, Mark Malamud, Marius Mitrea, Serguei Naboko	Abstract:  We study generalized polar decompositions of densely defined, closed linear operators in Hilbert spaces and provide some applications to relatively (form) bounded and relatively (form) compact perturbations of self-adjoint, normal, and m-sectorial operators. 
0808.01732	Pattern formation in growing sandpiles	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Deepak Dhar, Tridib Sadhu, Samarth Chandra	Abstract:  Adding grains at a single site on a flat substrate in the Abelian sandpile models produce beautiful complex patterns. We study in detail the pattern produced by adding grains on a two-dimensional square lattice with directed edges (each site has two arrows directed inward and two outward), starting with a periodic background with half the sites occupied. The size of the pattern formed scales with the number of grains added $N$ as $\sqrt{N}$. We give exact characterization of the asymptotic pattern, in terms of the position and shape of different features of the pattern. 
0808.01733	Magnetism Driven by Anion Vacancies in Superconducting $α$--FeSe$_{1-x}$	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:K.-W. Lee (DSP, Korea Univ.), V. Pardo (USC, Spain), W. E. Pickett (UC Davis)    	Abstract:  To study the microscopic electronic and magnetic interactions in the substoichiometric iron chalcogenide FeSe$_{1-x}$ which is observed to superconduct at x~1/8 up to $T_c$=27 K, we use first principles methods to study the Se vacancy in this nearly magnetic FeSe system. The vacancy forms a ferrimagnetic cluster of eight Fe atoms, which for the ordered x=1/8 alloy leads to half metallic conduction. Similar magnetic clusters are obtained for FeTe$_{1-x}$ and for BaFe$_2$As$_2$ with an As vacancy, although neither of these are half metallic. Based on fixed spin density results, we suggest the low energy excitations in FeSe$_{1-x}$ are antiparamagnon-like with short correlation length. 
0808.01734	Observation of a continuous phase transition in a shape-memory alloy	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:J. C. Lashley, S. M. Shapiro, B. L. Winn, C. P. Opeil, M. E. Manley, A. Alatas, W. Ratcliff, T. Park, R. A. Fisher, B. Mihaila, P. Riseborough, E. K. H. Salje, J. L. Smith	Abstract:  Elastic neutron-scattering, inelastic x-ray scattering, specific-heat, and pressure-dependent electrical transport measurements have been made on single crystals of AuZn and Au_{0.52}Zn_{0.48} above and below their martensitic transition temperatures (T_M=64K and 45K, respectively). In each composition, elastic neutron scattering detects new commensurate Bragg peaks (modulation) appearing at Q = (1.33,0.67,0) at temperatures corresponding to each sample's T_M. Although the new Bragg peaks appear in a discontinuous manner in the Au_{0.52}Zn_{0.48} sample, they appear in a continuous manner in AuZn. Surprising us, the temperature dependence of the AuZn Bragg peak intensity and the specific-heat jump near the transition temperature are in favorable accord with a mean-field approximation. A Landau-theory-based fit to the pressure dependence of the transition temperature suggests the presence of a critical endpoint in the AuZn phase diagram located at T_M*=2.7K and p*=3.1GPa, with a quantum saturation temperature θ_s=48.3 +/- 3.7K. 
0808.01735	Hawking radiation via Anomaly and Tunneling method from Unruh's and Canonical acoustic black hole	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Ramon Becar, Pablo Gonzalez, Gustavo Pulgar, Joel Saavedra	Abstract:  Hawking radiation from Unruh's and Canonical acoustic black hole is considered from viewpoint of anomaly cancellation method developed by Robinson and Wilczek. Thus, the physics near the horizon can be described using an infinite collection of massless two-dimensional scalar fields in the background of a dilaton and the gravitational anomaly is canceled by the flux of a 1 + 1 dimensional blackbody at the Hawking temperature of the space-time. Consequently, by this method, we can get the Hawking's temperature for Canonical and Unruh's acoustic black hole. 
0808.01736	Trapping in complex networks	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:Aristotelis Kittas, Shai Carmi, Shlomo Havlin, Panos Argyrakis	Abstract:  We investigate the trapping problem in Erdos-Renyi (ER) and Scale-Free (SF) networks. We calculate the evolution of the particle density $ρ(t)$ of random walkers in the presence of one or multiple traps with concentration $c$. We show using theory and simulations that in ER networks, while for short times $ρ(t) \propto \exp(-Act)$, for longer times $ρ(t)$ exhibits a more complex behavior, with explicit dependence on both the number of traps and the size of the network. In SF networks we reveal the significant impact of the trap's location: $ρ(t)$ is drastically different when a trap is placed on a random node compared to the case of the trap being on the node with the maximum connectivity. For the latter case we find $ρ(t)\propto\exp\left[-At/N^\frac{γ-2}{γ-1}\av{k}\right]$ for all $γ>2$, where $γ$ is the exponent of the degree distribution $P(k)\propto k^{-γ}$. 
0808.01737	The Properties of Long-Period Variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud from MACHO	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Oliver J. Fraser, Suzanne L. Hawley, Kem H. Cook	Abstract:  We present a new analysis of the long-period variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) from the MACHO Variable Star Catalog. Three-quarters of our sample of evolved, variable stars have periodic light curves. We characterize the stars in our sample using the multiple periods found in their frequency spectra. Additionally, we use single-epoch Two Micron All Sky Survey measurements to construct the average infrared light curves for different groups of these stars. Comparison with evolutionary models shows that stars on the red giant branch (RGB) or the early asymptotic giant branch (AGB) often show non-periodic variability, but begin to pulsate with periods on the two shortest period-luminosity sequences (3 & 4) when they brighten to K_s ~ 13. The stars on the thermally pulsing AGB are more likely to pulsate with longer periods that lie on the next two P-L sequences (1 & 2), including the sequence associated with the Miras in the LMC. The Petersen diagram and its variants show that multi-periodic stars on each pair of these sequences (3 & 4, and 1 & 2) typically pulsate with periods associated only with that pair. The periods in these multi-periodic stars become longer and stronger as the star evolves. We further constrain the mechanism behind the long secondary periods (LSPs) seen in half of our sample, and find that there is a close match between the luminosity functions of the LSP stars and all of the stars in our sample, and that these star's pulsation amplitudes are relatively wavelength independent. Although this is characteristic of stellar multiplicity, the large number of these variables is problematic for that explanation. 
0808.01738	Mapping low-latitude stellar substructure with SEGUE photometry	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jelte T. A. de Jong, Brian Yanny, Hans-Walter Rix, Eric F. Bell, Andrew E. Dolphin	Abstract:  Encircling the Milky Way at low latitudes, the Low Latitude Stream is a large stellar structure, the origin of which is as yet unknown. As part of the SEGUE survey, several photometric scans have been obtained that cross the Galactic plane, spread over a longitude range of 50 to 203 degrees. These data allow a systematic study of the structure of the Galaxy at low latitudes, where the Low Latitude Stream resides. We apply colour-magnitude diagram fitting techniques to map the stellar (sub)structure in these regions, enabling the detection of overdensities with respect to smooth models. These detections can be used to distinguish between different models of the Low Latitude Stream, and help to shed light on the nature of the system. 
0808.01739	Critical Charges on Strange Quark Nuggets and Other Extended Objects	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Duane A. Dicus, Wayne W. Repko, V. L. Teplitz	Abstract:  We investigate the behavior of the critical charge for spontaneous pair production, $Z_C$, defined as the charge at which the total energy of a $K$-shell electron is $E=-m_e$, as a function of the radius $R$ of the charge distribution. Our approach is to solve the Dirac equation for a potential $V(r)$ consisting of a spherically symmetrical charge distribution of radius $R$ and a Coulomb tail. For a spherical shell distribution of the type usually associated with color-flavor locked strange quark nuggets, we confirm the relation $Z_C=0.71 R({\rm fm})$ for sufficiently large $R$ obtained by Madsen, who used an approach based on the Thomas-Fermi model. We also present results for a uniformly charged sphere and again find that $Z_C\sim R$ for large enough $R$. Also discussed is the behavior of $Z_C$ when simple {\it ad hoc} modifications are made to the potential for $0\leq r < R$. 
0808.01740	Gamma-Ray Emission from the Broad-Line Radio Galaxy 3C111	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:R. C. Hartman, M. Kadler, J. Tueller	Abstract:  The broad-line radio galaxy 3C111 has been suggested as the counterpart of the gamma-ray source 3EGJ0416+3650. While 3C111 meets most of the criteria for a high-probability identification, like a bright flat-spectrum radio core and a blazar-like broadband SED, in the Third EGRET Catalog, the large positional offset of about 1.5 degrees put 3C111 outside the 99% probability region for 3EGJ0416+3650, making this association questionable. We present a re-analysis of all available data for 3C111 from the EGRET archives, resulting in probable detection of high-energy gamma-ray emission above 1000MeV from a position close to the nominal position of 3C111, in two separate viewing periods (VPs), at a 3-sigma level in each. A new source, GROJ0426+3747, appears to be present nearby. For >100MeV, one source seems to account for most of the EGRET-detected emission of 3EGJ0416+3650. A follow-up Swift UVOT/XRT observation reveals one moderately bright X-ray source in the error box of 3EGJ0416+3650, but because of the large EGRET position uncertainty, it is not certain that the X-ray and gamma-ray sources are associated. Another Swift observation, of GROJ0426+3747, detected no X-ray source nearby. 
0808.01741	D-bar Spark Theory and Deligne Cohomology	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Ning Hao	Abstract:  We study the Harvey-Lawson spark characters of level p on complex manifolds. Presenting Deligne cohomology classes by sparks of level $p$, we give an explicit analytic product formula for Deligne cohomology. We also define refined Chern classes in Deligne cohomology for holomorphic vector bundles over complex manifolds. Applications to algebraic cycles are given. A Bott-type vanishing theorem in Deligne cohomology for holomorphic foliations is established. A general construction of Nadel-type invariants is given together with a new proof of Nadel's conjecture. 
0808.01742	Weakly turbulent solutions for the cubic defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:J. Colliander, M. Keel, G. Staffilani, H. Takaoka, T. Tao	Abstract:  We consider the cubic defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation on the two dimensional torus. We exhibit smooth solutions for which the support of the conserved energy moves to higher Fourier modes. This weakly turbulent behavior is quantified by the growth of higher Sobolev norms: given any delta << 1, K >>1, s >1, we construct smooth initial data u_0 with ||u_0||_{{H}^s} < delta, so that the corresponding time evolution u satisfies ||u(T)||_{{H}^s} > K at some time T. This growth occurs despite the Hamiltonian's bound on ||u(t)||_{\dot{H}^1} and despite the conservation of the quantity ||u(t)||_{L^2}. The proof contains two arguments which may be of interest beyond the particular result described above. The first is a construction of the solution's frequency support that simplifies the system of ODE's describing each Fourier mode's evolution. The second is a construction of solutions to these simpler systems of ODE's which begin near one invariant manifold and ricochet from arbitrarily small neighborhoods of an arbitrarily large number of other invariant manifolds. The techniques used here are related to but are distinct from those traditionally used to prove Arnold Diffusion in perturbations of Hamiltonian systems. 
0808.01743	Central Simple Algebras with Involution: A Geometric Approach	Rings and Algebras (math.RA)	Authors:Nikolaus Vonessen	Abstract:  Let $k$ be an algebraically closed base field of characteristic zero. The category equivalence between central simple algebras and irreducible, generically free $PGL_n$-varieties is extended to the context of central simple algebras with involution. The associated variety of a central simple algebra with involution comes with an action of the semidirect product $P_{n,τ}:=PGL_n\rtimes<τ>$, where $τ$ is the automorphism of $\PGLn$ given by $τ(h)=(h^{-1})^transpose$. Basic properties of an involution are described in terms of the action of $P_{n,τ}$ on the associated variety, and in particular in terms of the stabilizer in general position for this action. 
0808.01744	Our Brothers' Keepers: Secure Routing with High Performance	Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)	Authors:Alex Brodsky, Scott Lindenberg	Abstract:  The Trinity (Brodsky et al., 2007) spam classification system is based on a distributed hash table that is implemented using a structured peer-to-peer overlay. Such an overlay must be capable of processing hundreds of messages per second, and must be able to route messages to their destination even in the presence of failures and malicious peers that misroute packets or inject fraudulent routing information into the system. Typically there is tension between the requirements to route messages securely and efficiently in the overlay. We describe a secure and efficient routing extension that we developed within the I3 (Stoica et al. 2004) implementation of the Chord (Stoica et al. 2001) overlay. Secure routing is accomplished through several complementary approaches: First, peers in close proximity form overlapping groups that police themselves to identify and mitigate fraudulent routing information. Second, a form of random routing solves the problem of entire packet flows passing through a malicious peer. Third, a message authentication mechanism links each message to it sender, preventing spoofing. Fourth, each peer's identifier links the peer to its network address, and at the same time uniformly distributes the peers in the key-space. Lastly, we present our initial evaluation of the system, comprising a 255 peer overlay running on a local cluster. We describe our methodology and show that the overhead of our secure implementation is quite reasonable. 
0808.01745	Approximate Killing Fields as an Eigenvalue Problem	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Christopher Beetle	Abstract:  Approximate Killing vector fields are expected to help define physically meaningful spins for non-symmetric black holes in general relativity. However, it is not obvious how such fields should be defined geometrically. This paper relates a definition suggested recently by Cook and Whiting to an older proposal by Matzner, which seems to have been overlooked in the recent literature. It also describes how to calculate approximate Killing fields based on these proposals using an efficient scheme that could be of immediate practical use in numerical relativity. 
0808.01746	Genus Two Surface and Quarter BPS Dyons: The Contour Prescription	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Shamik Banerjee, Ashoke Sen, Yogesh K. Srivastava	Abstract:  Following the suggestion of hep-th/0506249 and hep-th/0612011, we represent quarter BPS dyons in N=4 supersymmetric string theories as string network configuration and explore the role of genus two surfaces in determining the spectrum of such dyons. Our analysis leads to the correct contour prescription for integrating the partition function to determine the spectrum in different domains of the moduli space separated by the walls of marginal stability. 
0808.01747	Unparticle effects in neutrino telescopes	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:G. Gonzalez-Sprinberg, R. Martinez, Oscar A. Sampayo	Abstract:  Recently H.Georgi has introduced the concept of unparticles in order to describe the low energy physics of a nontrivial scale invariant sector of an effective theory. We investigate its physical effects on the neutrino flux to be detected in a kilometer cubic neutrino telescope such as IceCube. We study the effects, on different observables, of the survival neutrino flux after through the Earth and the regeneration originated in the neutral currents. We calculate the contribution of unparticle physics to the neutrino-nucleon interaction and, then, to the observables in order to evaluate detectable effects in IceCUbe. Our results are compared with the bounds obtained by other non-underground experiments. Finally, the results are presented as an exclusion plot in the relevant parameters of the new physics stuff. 
0808.01748	Thermal Canting of Spin-Bond Order	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:V.W. Scarola, K.B. Whaley, M. Troyer	Abstract:  Magnetism arising from coupled spin and spatial degrees of freedom underlies the properties of a broad array of physical systems. We study here the interplay between correlations in spin and space for the quantum compass model in a finite external field, using quantum Monte Carlo methods. We find that finite temperatures cant the spin and space (bond) correlations, with increasing temperature even reorienting spin correlations between orthogonal spatial directions. We develop a coupled mean field theory to understand this effect in terms of the underlying quantum critical properties of crossed Ising chains in transverse fields and an effective field that weakens upon increasing temperature. Thermal canting offers an experimental signature of spin-bond anisotropy. 
0808.01749	On the chain-level intersection pairing for PL pseudomanifolds	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Greg Friedman	Abstract:  James McClure recently showed that the domain for the intersection pairing of PL chains on a PL manifold $M$ is a subcomplex of $C_*(M)\otimes C_*(M)$ that is quasi-isomorphic to $C_*(M)\otimes C_*(M)$ and, more generally, that the intersection pairing endows $C_*(M)$ with the structure of a partially-defined commutative DGA. We generalize this theorem to intersection pairings of PL intersection chains on PL stratified pseudomanifolds and demonstrate the existence of a partial restricted commutative DGA structure. This structure is shown to generalize the iteration of the Goresky-MacPherson intersection product. As an application, we construct an explicit "roof" representation of the intersection homology pairing in the derived category of sheaves and verify that this sheaf theoretic pairing agrees with that arising from the geometric Goresky-MacPherson intersection pairing. 
0808.01750	Intersection homology Kunneth theorems	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Greg Friedman	Abstract:  Cohen, Goresky and Ji showed that there is a Kunneth theorem relating the intersection homology groups $I^{\bar p}H_*(X\times Y)$ to $I^{\bar p}H_*(X)$ and $I^{\bar p}H_*(Y)$, provided that the perversity $\bar p$ satisfies rather strict conditions. We consider biperversities and prove that there is a Künneth theorem relating $I^{\bar p,\bar q}H_*(X\times Y)$ to $I^{\bar p}H_*(X)$ and $I^{\bar q}H_*(Y)$ for all choices of $\bar p$ and $\bar q$. Furthermore, we prove that the Kunneth theorem still holds when the biperversity $p,q$ is "loosened" a little, and using this we recover the Kunneth theorem of Cohen-Goresky-Ji. 
0808.01751	The role of microtubule movement in bidirectional organelle transport	Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)	Authors:Igor M. Kulić, André E. X. Brown, Hwajin Kim, Comert Kural, Benjamin Blehm, Paul R. Selvin, Philip C. Nelson, Vladimir I. Gelfand	Abstract:  We study the role of microtubule movement in bidirectional organelle transport in Drosophila S2 cells and show that EGFP-tagged peroxisomes in cells serve as sensitive probes of motor induced, noisy cytoskeletal motions. Multiple peroxisomes move in unison over large time windows and show correlations with microtubule tip positions, indicating rapid microtubule fluctuations in the longitudinal direction. We report the first high-resolution measurement of longitudinal microtubule fluctuations performed by tracing such pairs of co-moving peroxisomes. The resulting picture shows that motor-dependent longitudinal microtubule oscillations contribute significantly to cargo movement along microtubules. Thus, contrary to the conventional view, organelle transport cannot be described solely in terms of cargo movement along stationary microtubule tracks, but instead includes a strong contribution from the movement of the tracks. 
0808.01752	Coupling optical and electrical gating for electronic read-out of quantum dot dynamics	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Smitha Vasudevan, Kamil Walczak, Avik W. Ghosh	Abstract:  We explore the coherent transfer of electronic signatures from a strongly correlated, optically gated nanoscale quantum dot to a weakly interacting, electrically backgated microscale channel. In this unique side-coupled `T' geometry for transport, we predict a novel mechanism for detecting Rabi oscillations induced in the dot through quantum, rather than electrostatic means. This detection shows up as a field-tunable split in the Fano lineshape arising due to interference between the dipole coupled dot states and the channel continuum. The split is further modified by the Coulomb interactions within the dot that influence the detuning of the Rabi oscillations. Furthermore, time-resolving the signal we see clear beats when the Rabi frequencies approach the intrinsic Bohr frequencies in the dot. Capturing these coupled dynamics, including memory effects and quantum interference in the channel and the many-body effects in the dot requires coupling a Fock-space master equation for the dot dynamics with the phase-coherent, non-Markovian time-dependent non-equilibrium Green's function (TDNEGF) transport formalism in the channel through a properly evaluated self-energy and a Coulomb integral. The strength of the interactions can further be modulated using a backgate that controls the degree of hybridization and charge polarization at the transistor surface. 
0808.01753	Index wiki database: design and experiments	Information Retrieval (cs.IR)	Authors:A. A. Krizhanovsky	Abstract:  With the fantastic growth of Internet usage, information search in documents of a special type called a "wiki page" that is written using a simple markup language, has become an important problem. This paper describes the software architectural model for indexing wiki texts in three languages (Russian, English, and German) and the interaction between the software components (GATE, Lemmatizer, and Synarcher). The inverted file index database was designed using visual tool DBDesigner. The rules for parsing Wikipedia texts are illustrated by examples. Two index databases of Russian Wikipedia (RW) and Simple English Wikipedia (SEW) are built and compared. The size of RW is by order of magnitude higher than SEW (number of words, lexemes), though the growth rate of number of pages in SEW was found to be 14% higher than in Russian, and the rate of acquisition of new words in SEW lexicon was 7% higher during a period of five months (from September 2007 to February 2008). The Zipf's law was tested with both Russian and Simple Wikipedias. The entire source code of the indexing software and the generated index databases are freely available under GPL (GNU General Public License).

We compute the Grothendieck $K$-theory of simplicial toric stack bundles and study the Chern character homomorphism. 
0808.01755	Superstring Sigma Model Computations Using the Pure Spinor Formalism	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Oscar A. Bedoya	Abstract:  In this thesis are presented two aplications of the sigma model for the superstring in the pure spinor formulation. The first aplication concerns the computation of the one-loop conformal invariance for the type II superstring, resulting in equations of motion written in superspace for the background fields coupled to the superstring. The second application is related to the BRST invariance of the heterotic superstring at the quantum level, which allows to find stringy corrections to the ten-dimensional super Yang-Mills/supergravity constraints.

We show that for some constant $C > 0$ depending on the cusp form and every fixed $c$ in the range $1 < c < 8/7$, the mean value of $λ(p)$ is $\ll \exp (-C \sqrt{\log N})$ as p runs over all (Piatetski-Shapiro) primes of the form $[n^c]$ with a natural number $n \leq N$. 
0808.01757	Particle Acceleration in Solar Flares and Enrichment of 3He and Heavy Ions	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Vahe' Petrosian	Abstract:  We discuss possible mechanisms of acceleration of particles in solar flares and show that turbulence plays an important role in all the mechanism. It is also argued that stochastic particle acceleration by turbulent plasma waves is the most likely mechanism for production of the high energy electrons and ions responsible for observed radiative signatures of solar flares and for solar energetic particle or SEPs, and that the predictions of this model agrees well with many past and recent high spectral and temporal observations of solar flares. It is shown that, in addition, the model explains many features of SEPs that accompany flares. In particular we show that it can successfully explain the observed extreme enhancement, relative to photospheric values, of $^3$He ions and the relative spectra of $^3$He and $^4$He. It has also the potential of explaining the relative abundances of most ions including the increasing enhancements of heavy ions with ion mass or mass-to-charge ratio. 
0808.01758	Electron-electron interaction effects on the photophysics of metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Zhendong Wang, Demetra Psiachos, Roberto F. Badilla, Sumit Mazumdar	Abstract:  Single-walled carbon nanotubes are strongly correlated systems with large Coulomb repulsion between two electrons occupying the same $p_z$ orbital. Within a molecular Hamiltonian appropriate for correlated $π$-electron systems, we show that optical excitations polarized parallel to the nanotube axes in the so-called metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes are to excitons. Our calculated absolute exciton energies in twelve different metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes, with diameters in the range 0.8 - 1.4 nm, are in nearly quantitative agreement with experimental results. We have also calculated the absorption spectrum for the (21,21) single-walled carbon nanotube in the E$_{22}$ region. Our calculated spectrum gives an excellent fit to the experimental absorption spectrum. In all cases our calculated exciton binding energies are only slightly smaller than those of semiconducting nanotubes with comparable diameters, in contradiction to results obtained within the {\it ab initio} approach, which predicts much smaller binding energies. We ascribe this difference to the difficulty of determining the behavior of systems with strong on-site Coulomb interactions within theories based on the density functional approach. As in the semiconducting nanotubes we predict in the metallic nanotubes a two-photon exciton above the lowest longitudinally polarized exciton that can be detected by ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy. We also predict a subgap absorption polarized perpendicular to the nanotube axes below the lowest longitudinal exciton, blueshifted from the exact midgap by electron-electron interactions. 
0808.01759	Rabi oscillations and photocurrent in quantum-dot tunnelling junctions	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Boris Fainberg, Abraham Nitzan	Abstract:  Motivated by the experiments by Zrenner et al. [Nature 418, 612 (2002)], we study the influence of relaxation processes on converting Rabi oscillations in a strongly biased single-quantum-dot photodiode into deterministic photocurrents. We show that the behavior of a quantum dot with different tunnel rates for electron and holes is qualitatively different from that with the equal tunnel rates: in the latter case the current shows attenuating oscillations with the Rabi frequency. In contrast, for different electrons and holes tunnelling rates, the frequency of these oscillations diminishes, and they disappear beyond a definite asymmetry threshold. We give an analytical solution of the problem and a numerical example showing a different behaviour of the transferred charge in the small attenuation limit for equal and different tunnel rates for electrons and holes. 
0808.01760	A relative version of Kummer theory	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Vahid Shirbisheh (Tarbiat Modares University)    	Abstract:  Let $E/F$ be a cyclic Galois extension of degree $p^l$ with Galois group $G$. It is shown that the Galois module structure of both sides of the Kummer pairing (for Kummer extensions of $E$) are the same. In other words, we show that the Kummer duality holds in the level of finitely generated $G$-modules. 
0808.01761	Injective and non-injective realizations with symmetry	Metric Geometry (math.MG)	Authors:Bernd Schulze	Abstract:  In this paper, we introduce a natural classification of bar and joint frameworks that possess symmetry. This classification establishes the mathematical foundation for extending a variety of results in rigidity, as well as infinitesimal or static rigidity, to frameworks that are realized with certain symmetries and whose joints may or may not be embedded injectively in the space. In particular, we introduce a symmetry-adapted notion of `generic' frameworks with respect to this classification and show that `almost all' realizations in a given symmetry class are generic and all generic realizations in this class share the same infinitesimal rigidity properties. Within this classification we also clarify under what conditions group representation theory techniques can be applied to further analyze the rigidity properties of a (not necessarily injective) symmetric realization. 
0808.01762	Communication Complexities of XOR functions	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Yaoyun Shi, Zhiqiang Zhang	Abstract:  We call $F:\{0, 1\}^n\times \{0, 1\}^n\to\{0, 1\}$ a symmetric XOR function if for a function $S:\{0, 1, ..., n\}\to\{0, 1\}$, $F(x, y)=S(|x\oplus y|)$, for any $x, y\in\{0, 1\}^n$, where $|x\oplus y|$ is the Hamming weight of the bit-wise XOR of $x$ and $y$. We show that for any such function, (a) the deterministic communication complexity is always $Θ(n)$ except for four simple functions that have a constant complexity, and (b) up to a polylog factor, the error-bounded randomized and quantum communication complexities are $Θ(r_0+r_1)$, where $r_0$ and $r_1$ are the minimum integers such that $r_0, r_1\leq n/2$ and $S(k)=S(k+2)$ for all $k\in[r_0, n-r_1)$. 
0808.01763	CMB polarimetry with BICEP: instrument characterization, calibration, and performance	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yuki D. Takahashi, Denis Barkats, John O. Battle, Evan M. Bierman, James J. Bock, H. Cynthia Chiang, C. Darren Dowell, Eric F. Hivon, William L. Holzapfel, Viktor V. Hristov, William C. Jones, J. P. Kaufman, Brian G. Keating, John M. Kovac, Chao-Lin Kuo, Andrew E. Lange, Erik M. Leitch, Peter V. Mason, Tomotake Matsumura, Hien T. Nguyen, Nicolas Ponthieu, Graca M. Rocha, Ki Won Yoon, P. Ade, L. Duband	Abstract:  BICEP is a ground-based millimeter-wave bolometric array designed to target the primordial gravity wave signature on the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at degree angular scales. Currently in its third year of operation at the South Pole, BICEP is measuring the CMB polarization with unprecedented sensitivity at 100 and 150 GHz in the cleanest available 2% of the sky, as well as deriving independent constraints on the diffuse polarized foregrounds with select observations on and off the Galactic plane. Instrument calibrations are discussed in the context of rigorous control of systematic errors, and the performance during the first two years of the experiment is reviewed. 
0808.01764	Did Gravitational Waves Affect the Evolution of the Universe?	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:David Garrison	Abstract:  As Cosmologists struggle to understand the evolution of our universe, an often over-looked element is the affect of gravitational radiation on the primordial plasma field. This appears to be due to the inaccurate approximation of the primordial plasma field as a simple hydrodynamic fluid, therefore neglecting the full dynamics of the magneto-fluid. In this paper, we show how gravitational waves may have had a significant impact on the evolution of our universe. While more work is needed, the author hopes to eventually develop a large-scale simulation of structure formation in the early universe, which takes the interactions of scalar perturbations, gravitational waves, magnetic fields and a dynamic plasma field into account. 
0808.01765	Planetary systems around close binary stars: the case of the very dusty, Sun-like, spectroscopic binary BD+20 307	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:B. Zuckerman, Francis C. Fekel, Michael H. Williamson, Gregory W. Henry, M. P. Muno	Abstract:  Field star BD+20 307 is the dustiest known main sequence star, based on the fraction of its bolometric luminosity, 4%, that is emitted at infrared wavelengths. The particles that carry this large IR luminosity are unusually warm, comparable to the temperature of the zodiacal dust in the solar system, and their existence is likely to be a consequence of a fairly recent collision of large objects such as planets or planetary embryos. Thus, the age of BD+20 307 is potentially of interest in constraining the era of terrestrial planet formation. The present project was initiated with an attempt to derive this age using the Chandra X-ray Observatory to measure the X-ray flux of BD+20 307 in conjunction with extensive photometric and spectroscopic monitoring observations from Fairborn Observatory. However, the recent realization that BD+20 307 is a short period, double-line, spectroscopic binary whose components have very different lithium abundances, vitiates standard methods of age determination. We find the system to be metal-poor; this, combined with its measured lithium abundances, indicates that BD+20 307 may be several to many Gyr old. BD+20 307 affords astronomy a rare peek into a mature planetary system in orbit around a close binary star (because such systems are not amenable to study by the precision radial velocity technique). 
0808.01766	The Optimal Quantile Estimator for Compressed Counting	Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)	Authors:Ping Li	Abstract:  Compressed Counting (CC) was recently proposed for very efficiently computing the (approximate) $α$th frequency moments of data streams, where $0<α <= 2$. Several estimators were reported including the geometric mean estimator, the harmonic mean estimator, the optimal power estimator, etc. The geometric mean estimator is particularly interesting for theoretical purposes. For example, when $α-> 1$, the complexity of CC (using the geometric mean estimator) is $O(1/ε)$, breaking the well-known large-deviation bound $O(1/ε^2)$. The case $α\approx 1$ has important applications, for example, computing entropy of data streams. For practical purposes, this study proposes the optimal quantile estimator. Compared with previous estimators, this estimator is computationally more efficient and is also more accurate when $α> 1$. 
0808.01767	Quantum Statistical Mechanics of $\mathbb{Q}$-lattices and noncommutative geometry	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Vahid Shirbisheh	Abstract:  After recalling some basic notions of quantum statistical mechanics, we explain the Bost-Connes system that relates the structure of the maximal abelian extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ to the space of \kms states of a \cs-dynamical system. Afterwards, we study briefly the Connes-Marcolli $\text{GL}_2$-system as a generalization of the former system. 
0808.01768	Quadratic fermionic interactions yield effective Hamiltonians for adiabatic quantum computing	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Michael J. O'Hara, Dianne P. O'Leary	Abstract:  Polynomially-large ground-state energy gaps are rare in many-body quantum systems, but useful for adiabatic quantum computing. We show analytically that the gap is generically polynomially-large for quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians. We then prove that adiabatic quantum computing can realize the ground states of Hamiltonians with certain random interactions, as well as the ground states of one, two, and three-dimensional fermionic interaction lattices, in polynomial time. Finally, we use the Jordan-Wigner transformation and a related transformation for spin-3/2 particles to show that our results can be restated using spin operators in a surprisingly simple manner. A direct consequence is that the one-dimensional cluster state can be found in polynomial time using adiabatic quantum computing. 
0808.01769	Spectroscopic Confirmation of the Fifth Image of SDSS J1004+4112 and Implications for the M_BH-sigma_* Relation at z=0.68	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Naohisa Inada, Masamune Oguri, Emilio E. Falco, Tom J. Broadhurst, Eran O. Ofek, Christopher S. Kochanek, Keren Sharon, Graham P. Smith	Abstract:  We present the results of deep spectroscopy for the central region of the cluster lens SDSS J1004+4112 with the Subaru telescope. A secure detection of an emission line of the faint blue stellar object (component E) near the center of the brightest cluster galaxy (G1) confirms that it is the central fifth image of the lensed quasar system. In addition, we measure the stellar velocity dispersion of G1 to be sigma_* = 352+-13 km/s. We combine these results to obtain constraints on the mass M_BH of the putative black hole (BH) at the center of the inactive galaxy G1, and hence on the M_BH-sigma_* relation at the lens redshift z_l=0.68. From detailed mass modeling, we place an upper limit on the black hole mass, M_BH < 2.1x10^{10}M_sun at 1-sigma level (<3.1x10^{10}M_sun at 3-sigma), which is consistent with black hole masses expected from the local and redshift-evolved M_BH-sigma_* relations, M_BH~10^{9}-10^{10}M_sun. 
0808.01770	Superharmonic Perturbations of a Gaussian Measure, Equilibrium Measures and Orthogonal Polynomials	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:F. Balogh, J. Harnad	Abstract:  This work concerns superharmonic perturbations of a Gaussian measure given by a special class of positive weights in the complex plane of the form $w(z) = \exp(-|z|^2 + U^μ(z))$, where $U^μ(z)$ is the logarithmic potential of a compactly supported positive measure $μ$. The equilibrium measure of the corresponding weighted energy problem is shown to be supported on subharmonic generalized quadrature domains for a large class of perturbing potentials $U^μ(z)$. It is also shown that the $2\times 2$ matrix d-bar problem for orthogonal polynomials with respect to such weights is well-defined and has a unique solution given explicitly by Cauchy transforms. Numerical evidence is presented supporting a conjectured relation between the asymptotic distribution of the zeroes of the orthogonal polynomials in a semi-classical scaling limit and the Schwarz function of the curve bounding the support of the equilibrium measure, extending the previously studied case of harmonic polynomial perturbations with weights $w(z)$ supported on a compact domain. 
0808.01771	A Very Efficient Scheme for Estimating Entropy of Data Streams Using Compressed Counting	Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)	Authors:Ping Li	Abstract:  Compressed Counting (CC)} was recently proposed for approximating the $α$th frequency moments of data streams, for $0<α\leq 2$. Under the relaxed strict-Turnstile model, CC dramatically improves the standard algorithm based on symmetric stable random projections}, especially as $α\to 1$. A direct application of CC is to estimate the entropy, which is an important summary statistic in Web/network measurement and often serves a crucial "feature" for data mining. The Rényi entropy and the Tsallis entropy are functions of the $α$th frequency moments; and both approach the Shannon entropy as $α\to 1$. A recent theoretical work suggested using the $α$th frequency moment to approximate the Shannon entropy with $α=1+δ$ and very small $|δ|$ (e.g., $<10^{-4}$). In this study, we experiment using CC to estimate frequency moments, Rényi entropy, Tsallis entropy, and Shannon entropy, on real Web crawl data. We demonstrate the variance-bias trade-off in estimating Shannon entropy and provide practical recommendations. In particular, our experiments enable us to draw some important conclusions: (1) As $α\to 1$, CC dramatically improves {\em symmetric stable random projections} in estimating frequency moments, Rényi entropy, Tsallis entropy, and Shannon entropy. The improvements appear to approach "infinity." (2) Using {\em symmetric stable random projections} and $α= 1+δ$ with very small $|δ|$ does not provide a practical algorithm because the required sample size is enormous. 
0808.01772	Effective mass calculations of SrTiO3-based superlattices for thermoelectric applications lead to new layer design	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Wilfried Wunderlich, Hiromichi Ohta, Kunichi Koumoto	Abstract:  The effective mass is one of the main factors for enlarging the Seebeck coefficient and electronic conductivity of SrTiO3-based thermoelectric materials [1,2]. The goal of this paper is to clarify, how superlattices can change the effective mass and other features of the bandstructure. The natural Ruddlesden-Popper phase (SrTiO3)n(SrO)m with n=2, m=1 the situation changes, because the TiO6-octahedrons are slightly extended, due to diluted density of the SrO layer. Another effect is the deformed electron density, which leads to reduced effective mass perpendicular to the layer, but enlarged parallel to the plane [3]. The average value of the effective mass over this anisotropy of the 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) for pure Ruddlesden-Popper phases is smaller, but can increase beyond the value of pure Pervoskite for certain doping elements. In the same way, artificial superlattices (SrTiO3)x/(SrTi1-z(Nb)zO3)y were examined. When fine nanostructures (n=2, m=3 or n=3, m=2) are present the effective mass increases, when the structure becomes coarser (n=4, m=1) smaller values are determined.

Bigi	Abstract:  $D^0$ oscillations, for which the $B$ factories have found strong evidence, provide a new stage for our search for New Physics in heavy flavour dynamics. While the theoretical verdict on the observed values of $x_D$ and $y_D$ is ambiguous -- they could be fully generated by SM dynamics, yet could contain also a sizable contribution from New Physics -- such oscillations can enhance the observability of \cp violation driven by New Physics. After emphasizing the unique role of charm among up-type quarks, I sketch the \cp phenomenology for partial widths and final state distributions. 
0808.01774	Nonpositively curved metric in the positive cone of a finite von Neumann algebra	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Esteban Andruchow, Gabriel Larotonda	Abstract:  In this paper we study the metric geometry of the space $Σ$ of positive invertible elements of a von Neumann algebra ${\mathcal A}$ with a finite, normal and faithful tracial state $τ$. The trace induces an incomplete Riemannian metric $<x,y>_a=τ(ya^{-1}xa^{-1})$, and though the techniques involved are quite different, the situation here resembles in many relevant aspects that of the $n\times n$ matrices when they are regarded as a symmetric space. For instance we prove that geodesics are the shortest paths for the metric induced, and that the geodesic distance is a convex function; we give an intrinsic (algebraic) characterization of the geodesically convex submanifolds $M$ of $Σ$, and under suitable hypothesis we prove a factorization theorem for elements in the algebra that resembles the Iwasawa decomposition for matrices. This factorization is obtained \textit{via} a nonlinear orthogonal projection $Π_M:Σ\to M$, a map which turns out to be contractive for the geodesic distance. 
0808.01775	Indecomposable $PD_3$-complexes	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:J.A.Hillman	Abstract:  We show that if $X$ is an indecomposable $PD_3$-complex and $π_1(X) is the fundamental group of a reduced finite graph of finite groups but is not virtually cyclic then $X$ is orientable, the underlying graph is a tree, all the edge groups are $Z/2Z$ and all but at most one of the vertex groups is dihedral of order $2m$ with $m$ odd. Every such group is realized by some $PD_3$-complex. We also propose a strategy for tackling the question of whether every $PD_3$-complex has a finite covering space which is homotopy equivalent to a closed orientable 3-manifold. 
0808.01776	Open flavour Charmed Mesons	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:P C Vinodkumar, Ajay Kumar Rai, Bhavin Patel, Jignesh Pandya	Abstract:  We present here recent results on the investigations of the mass spectrum (S-states and P-states), decay constants, decay widths and life time of the D, $D_s$,and $B_c$mesons within the framework of phenomenological potential models.We also present the binding energy and the masses of the di-meson molecular systems with one or more charm meson combinations. Many of the newly found experimental open charm states are identified with the orbital excitations of the conventional open charm mesons while others like X(3872), Y(3930), $D_{sJ}$(2632, 2700) \emph{etc.}, are identified as molecular like states. 
0808.01777	Spin-charge Separation in Nodal Antiferromagnetic Insulator	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Su-Peng Kou	Abstract:  In this paper, by using two dimensional (2D) Hubbard models with pi-flux phase and that on a hexagonal lattice as examples, we explore spin-charge-separated solitons in nodal antiferromagnetic (AF) insulator - an AF order with massive Dirac fermionic excitations (see detail in the paper). We calculate fermion zero modes and induced quantum numbers on solitons (half skyrmions) in the continuum limit, which are similar to that in the quasi one-dimensional conductor polyacetylene (CH)x and that in topological band insulator. In particular, we find some novel phenomena : thanks to an induced staggered spin moment, a mobile half skyrmion becomes a fermionic particle; when a hole or an electron is added, the half skyrmion turns into a bosonic particle with charge degree of freedom only. Our results imply that nontrivial induced quantum number on solitons may be a universal feature of spin-charge separation in different systems. 
0808.01778	Frame-like gauge invariant formulation for massive high spin particles	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Yu. M. Zinoviev	Abstract:  In this paper we extend a so called frame-like formulation of massless high spin particles to massive case. We start with two explicit examples of massive spin 2 and spin 3 particles and then construct gauge invariant description for arbitrary integer spin case. Similarly, for the fermionic case we start with first non-trivial example -- massive spin 5/2 particle and then construct gauge invariant description for arbitrary half-integer spin case. In all cases we consider massive particles in (A)dS spaces with arbitrary cosmological constant (including flat Minkowski space) and this allows one to investigate all possible massless and partially massless limits for such particles. 
0808.01779	Spin Filter, Spin Amplifier and Other Spintronic Applications in Graphene Nanodisks	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Motohiko Ezawa	Abstract:  Graphene nanodisk is a graphene derivative with a closed edge. The trigonal zigzag nanodisk with size $N$ has $N$-fold degenerated zero-energy states. A nanodisk can be interpletted as a quantum dot with an internal degree of freedom. The grand state of nanodisk has been argued to be a quasi-ferromagnet, which is a ferromagnetic-like states with a finite but very long life time. We investigate the spin-filter effects in the system made of nanodisks and leads based on the master equation. The finite-size effect on spin filter is intriguing due to a reaction from the polarization of incoming current to a quasi-ferromagnet. Analyzing the relaxation process with the use of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we explore the response to four types of incoming currents, namely, unpolarized current, perfectly polarized current, partially polarized current and pulse polarized current. We propose some applications for spintronics, such as spin memory, spin amplifier, spin valve, spin-field-effect transistor and spin diode. 
0808.01780	Wobbling of What?	Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)	Authors:Denis A. Semenov	Abstract:  A simple explanation for the symmetry of the genetic code has been suggested. An alternative to the wobble hypothesis has been proposed. The facts revealed in this study offer a new insight into physical mechanisms of the functioning of the genetic code. 
0808.01781	Spin-Domain Formation in Antiferromagnetic Condensates	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Michal Matuszewski, Tristram J. Alexander, Yuri S. Kivshar	Abstract:  Antiferromagnetic condensates are generally believed not to display modulational instability and subsequent spin-domain formation. Here we demonstrate that in he presence of a homogeneous magnetic field antiferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates can undergo spatial modulational instability followed by the subsequent generation of spin domains. Employing numerical simulations for realistic conditions, we show how this novel effect can be observed in sodium condensates confined in an optical trap. Finally, we link this instability and spin-domain formation with stationary modes of the condensate. 
0808.01782	Architectural design for a topological cluster state quantum computer	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Simon J. Devitt, Austin G. Fowler, Ashley M. Stephens, Andrew D. Greentree, Lloyd C.L. Hollenberg, William J. Munro, Kae Nemoto	Abstract:  The development of a large scale quantum computer is a highly sought after goal of fundamental research and consequently a highly non-trivial problem. Scalability in quantum information processing is not just a problem of qubit manufacturing and control but it crucially depends on the ability to adapt advanced techniques in quantum information theory, such as error correction, to the experimental restrictions of assembling qubit arrays into the millions. In this paper we introduce a feasible architectural design for large scale quantum computation in optical systems. We combine the recent developments in topological cluster state computation with the photonic module, a simple chip based device which can be used as a fundamental building block for a large scale computer. The integration of the topological cluster model with this comparatively simple operational element addresses many significant issues in scalable computing and leads to a promising modular architecture with complete integration of active error correction exhibiting high fault-tolerant thresholds. 
0808.01783	Criticality in the Quantum Kicked Rotor with a Smooth Potential	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:Rina Dutta, Pragya Shukla	Abstract:  We investigate the possibility of an Anderson type transition in the quantum kicked rotor with a smooth potential due to dynamical localization of the wavefunctions. Our results show the typical characteristics of a critical behavior i.e multifractal eigenfunctions and a scale-invariant level-statistics at a critical kicking strength which classically corresponds to a mixed regime. This indicates the existence of a localization to delocalization transition in the quantum kicked rotor. Our study also reveals the possibility of other type of transitions in the quantum kicked rotor, with a kicking strength well within strongly chaotic regime. These transitions, driven by the breaking of exact symmetries e.g. time-reversal and parity, are similar to weak-localization transitions in disordered metals. 
0808.01784	Superconductivity in layered iron Selenide induced by cobalt- and sodium-doping	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Zhanqiang Liu, Aihua Fang, Fuqiang Huang, Mianheng Jiang	Abstract:  Superconductivity with zero resistance transition temperature (Tc) up to 8.4 K and 8.3 K can be obtained by doping cobalt and sodium in alfa-FeSe with the nominal composition of Fe0.92Co0.08Se and Na0.1FeSe, respectively. The electrical resistivity and AC magnetic susceptibility of the prepared samples, measured with physical property measurement system (PPMS), unambiguously consistent with each other to indicate that the samples are superconductive. The respective doping mechanisms for cobalt and sodium into the parent alfa-FeSe are the Fe-site substitution and the interlayer insertion. It is the first time that alfa-FeSe can be induced to be a superconductor with Na+ intercalated into the interlayers. 
0808.01785	The structure and dynamics of young star clusters: King 16, NGC 1931, NGC 637 and NGC 189	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Priya Hasan, S N Hasan, Urmi Shah	Abstract:  In this paper, using 2MASS photometry, we study the structural and dynamical properties of four young star clusters viz. King 16, NGC 1931, NGC 637 and NGC 189. For the clusters King 16, NGC 1931, NGC 637 and NGC 189, we obtain the limiting radii of 7', 12', 6' and 5' which correspond to linear radii of 3.6 pc, 8.85 pc, 3.96 pc and 2.8 pc respectively. The reddening values $E(B-V)$ obtained for the clusters are 0.85, 0.65--0.85, 0.6 and 0.53 and their true distances are 1786 pc, 3062 pc, 2270 pc and 912 pc respectively. Ages of the clusters are 6 Myr, 4 Myr, 4 Myr and 10 Myr respectively. We compare their structures, luminosity functions and mass functions ($φ(M) = dN/dM \propto M^{-(1+χ)}$) to the parameter $τ= t_{age}/t_{relax}$ to study the star formation process and the dynamical evolution of these clusters. We find that, for our sample, mass seggregation is observed in clusters or their cores only when the ages of the clusters are comparable to their relaxation times ($τ \geq 1$). These results suggest mass seggregation due to dynamical effects. The values of $χ$, which characterise the overall mass functions for the clusters are 0.96 $\pm$ 0.11, 1.16 $\pm$ 0.18, 0.55 $\pm$ 0.14 and 0.66 $\pm$ 0.31 respectively. The change in $χ$ as a function of radius is a good indicator of the dynamical state of clusters. 
0808.01786	Generation of fluctuations during inflation: comparison of stochastic and field-theoretic approaches	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:F. Finelli, G. Marozzi, A. A. Starobinsky, G. P. Vacca, G. Venturi	Abstract:  We prove that the stochastic and standard field-theoretical approaches produce exactly the same results for the amount of light massive scalar field fluctuations generated during inflation in the leading order of the slow-roll approximation. This is true both in the case for which this field is a test one and inflation is driven by another field, and the case for which the field plays the role of inflaton itself. In the latter case, in order to calculate the average of the mean square of the gauge-invariant inflaton fluctuation, the logarithm of the scale factor $a$ has to be used as the time variable in the Fokker-Planck equation in the stochastic approach. The implications of particle production during inflation for the second stage of inflation and for the moduli problem are also discussed. The case of a massless self-interacting test scalar field in a de Sitter background with a zero initial renormalized mean square is also considered in order to show how the stochastic approach can easily produce results corresponding to diagrams with an arbitrary number of scalar field loops in the field-theoretical approach (explicit results up to 4 loops inclusive are presented).

Woodruff	Abstract:  Given a directed graph G = (V,E) and an integer k>=1, a k-transitive-closure-spanner (k-TC-spanner) of G is a directed graph H = (V, E_H) that has (1) the same transitive-closure as G and (2) diameter at most k. These spanners were implicitly studied in access control, data structures, and property testing, and properties of these spanners have been rediscovered over the span of 20 years. The main goal in each of these applications is to obtain the sparsest k-TC-spanners. We bring these diverse areas under the unifying framework of TC-spanners. We initiate the study of approximability of the size of the sparsest k-TC-spanner for a given directed graph. We completely resolve the approximability of 2-TC-spanners, showing that it is Theta(log n) unless P = NP. For k>2, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a k-TC-spanner with size within O((n log n)^{1-1/k}) of the optimum. Our algorithmic techniques also yield algorithms with the best-known approximation ratio for well-studied problems on directed spanners when k>3: DIRECTED k-SPANNER, CLIENT/SERVER DIRECTED k-SPANNER, and k-DIAMETER SPANNING SUBGRAPH. For constant k>=3, we show that the size of the sparsest k-TC-spanner is hard to approximate with 2^{log^{1-eps} n} ratio unless NP \subseteq DTIME(n^{polylog n}}). Finally, we study the size of the sparsest k-TC-spanners for H-minor-free graph families. Combining our constructions with our insight that 2-TC-spanners can be used for designing property testers, we obtain a monotonicity tester with O(log^2 n /eps) queries for any poset whose transitive reduction is an H-minor free digraph, improving the Theta(sqrt(n) log n/eps)-queries required of the tester due to Fischer et al (2002). 
0808.01788	Some extensions of the class of convex bodies	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Vladimir Golubyatnikov, Vladimir Rovenski	Abstract:  We introduce and study a new class of $\eps$-convex bodies (extending the class of convex bodies) in metric and normed linear spaces. We analyze relations between characteristic properties of convex bodies, demonstrate how $\eps$-convex bodies connect with some classical results of Convex Geometry, as Helly theorem, and find applications to geometric tomography. We introduce the notion of a circular projection and investigate the problem of determination of $\eps$-convex bodies by their projection-type images. The results generalize corresponding stability theorems by H. Groemer. 
0808.01789	The NGC 672 and NGC 784 Galaxy Groups: Evidence for Galaxy Formation and Growth Along a Nearby Dark Matter Filament	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Adi Zitrin, Noah Brosch	Abstract:  (Abridged): We present U, B, V, R, I, H-alpha and NUV photometry of 14 galaxies in the very local Universe (within 10 Mpc that are dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrr), are at low redshift (51<v<610 km/s), and appear as a six degree long linear filament.. We examine the star formation (SF) properties of individual objects with the current SF rate (SFR) derived directly from the H-alpha line flux and compare the multi-band photometry with results of galaxy evolution assuming short SF bursts separated by long quiescence periods. Most objects contain at least one "old" stellar population (>1-10 Gyr) and one "young" population (<30 Myr) with the recent SF bursts occurring a few to a few 10s of Myr ago, arguing for synchronicity in star formation in these objects. We propose that the ~synchronous star formation in all objects is caused by the accretion of cold gas from intergalactic space onto dark matter haloes arranged along a filament threading the void where these dwarf galaxies reside and point out this galaxy sample as an ideal target to study hierarchical clustering and galaxy formation among very nearby objects. 
0808.01790	Magnetic flux penetration and AC loss in a composite superconducting wire with ferromagnetic parts	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:F. Gömöry, M. Vojenčiak, E. Pardo, J. Šouc	Abstract:  The current distribution and the AC loss in a composite superconducting tape containing a layer from magnetic material is calculated and compared with experiments, showing a very good agreement. The situations of an alternating uniform applied field or a transport current are studied. The newly developed numerical model is an approximation to the critical state model, adapted for the applicability to commercial finite elements codes that solve the vector potential. Substantial feature of this procedure is that it can be carried out in the case when the critical current density in superconductor depends on the magnetic field and the magnetic layer material is non- linear. Additionally, the hysteresis loss in the magnetic material is estimated, based on its measured magnetization loops. Measurements on Bi-2223 multifilamentary tapes covered on edges by nickel confirmed our predictions, showing a substantial ac loss reduction in both the investigated regimes. 
0808.01791	Perturbative calculations for the HISQ action: the gluon action at $O(N_fα_sa^2)$	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:A. Hart, G.M. von Hippel, R.R. Horgan	Abstract:  We present a new (and general) algorithm for deriving lattice Feynman rules which is capable of handling actions as complex as the Highly Improved Staggered Quark (HISQ) action. This enables us to perform a perturbative calculation of the influence of dynamical HISQ fermions on the perturbative improvement of the gluonic action in the same way as we have previously done for asqtad fermions. We find the fermionic contributions to the radiative corrections in the Lüscher-Weisz gauge action to be somewhat larger for HISQ fermions than for asqtad. 
0808.01792	On the number of allelic types for samples taken from exchangeable coalescents with mutation	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Fabian Freund, Martin Möhle	Abstract:  Let $K_n$ denote the number of types of a sample of size $n$ taken from an exchangeable coalescent process ($Ξ$-coalescent) with mutation. A distributional recursion for the sequence $(K_n)_{n\in{\mathbb N}}$ is derived. If the coalescent does not have proper frequencies, i.e., if the characterizing measure $Ξ$ on the infinite simplex $Δ$ does not have mass at zero and satisfies $\int_Δ|x|Ξ(dx)/(x,x)<\infty$, where $|x|:=\sum_{i=1}^\infty x_i$ and $(x,x):=\sum_{i=1}^\infty x_i^2$ for $x=(x_1,x_2,...)\inΔ$, then $K_n/n$ converges weakly as $n\to\infty$ to a limiting variable $K$ which is characterized by an exponential integral of the subordinator associated with the coalescent process. For so-called simple measures $Ξ$ satisfying $\int_ΔΞ(dx)/(x,x)<\infty$ we characterize the distribution of $K$ via a fixed-point equation. 
0808.01793	Curvaton with Polynomial Potential	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Qing-Guo Huang	Abstract:  In general a weakly self-interacting curvaton field is expected and the curvaton potential takes the polynomial form. The curvaton potential can be dominated by the self-interaction term during the period of inflation if the curvaton field stays at a large vacuum expectation value. We use the $δ {\cal N}$ formalism to calculate the primordial curvature perturbation in the various possible scenarios which make the curvaton model much richer. 
0808.01794	Neon and Chemical Fractionation Trends in Late-type Stellar Atmospheres	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:D.Garcia-Alvarez (1,2), J.J. Drake (3), P. Testa (3) ((1) IAC, (2)GTC/CALP,(3)Harvard-Smithsonian CfA)    	Abstract:  A survey of Ne, O and Fe coronal abundances culled from the recent literature for about 60 late-type stars confirms that the Ne/O ratio of stellar outer atmospheres is about two times the value recently recommended by Asplund et al. The mean Ne/O remains flat from the most active stars down to at least intermediate activity levels (-5L_X/L_bol<-2), with some evidence for a decline toward the lowest activity levels sampled. The abundances surveyed are all based on emission measure distribution analyses and the mean Ne/O is about 0.1 dex lower than that found from line ratios in the seminal study of mostly active stars by Drake & Testa (2005), but is within the systematic uncertainties of that study. We also confirm a pattern of strongly decreasing Fe/O with increasing stellar activity. The observed abundance patterns are reminiscent of the recent finding of a dependence of the solar Ne/O and Fe/O ratios on active region plasma temperature and indicate a universal fractionation process is at work. The firm saturation in stellar Ne/O at higher activity levels combined with variability in the solar coronal Ne/O leads us to suggest that Ne is generally depleted in the solar outer atmosphere and photospheric values are reflected in active stellar coronae. The solution to the recent solar model problem would then appear to lie in a combination of the Asplund et al O abundance downward revision being too large, and the Ne abundance being underestimated for the Sun by about a factor of 2. 
0808.01795	A classification of smooth embeddings of 4-manifolds in 7-space, II	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Diarmuid Crowley, Arkadiy Skopenkov	Abstract:  Let N be a closed, connected, smooth 4-manifold with H_1(N;Z)=0. Our main result is the following classification of the set E^7(N) of smooth embeddings N->R^7 up to smooth isotopy. Haefliger proved that the set E^7(S^4) with the connected sum operation is a group isomorphic to Z_{12}. This group acts on E^7(N) by embedded connected sum. Boechat and Haefliger constructed an invariant BH:E^7(N)->H_2(N;Z) which is injective on the orbit space of this action; they also described im(BH). We determine the orbits of the action: for u in im(BH) the number of elements in BH^{-1}(u) is GCD(u/2,12) if u is divisible by 2, or is GCD(u,3) if u is not divisible by 2. The proof is based on a new approach using modified surgery as developed by Kreck. 
0808.01796	A study of quark-gluon vertices using the lattice Coulomb gauge domain wall fermion	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Sadataka Furui	Abstract:  I calculate the quark-gluon vertex of the tensor type $Γ(p,q)=g_3(p,q)p_4 \Slash{\Vec q}$, vector type $g_2(p,q)\Vec q$ and scalar type $g_1(p,q)$, for a small spacial momentum transfer $q=\bf q$ using the gauge configuration of the Domain Wall Fermion (DWF) provided by the RBC-UKQCD collaboration. The quark propagator of Coulomb gauge in the cylinder cut, i.e. the four momentum $p$ is directed along the diagonal of the hyper-cubic space has small fluctuation and I use this propagator in the evaluation of the operators by applying the non-perturbative renormalization method. The $q$ dependence of the running coupling $α_{s,g_1}(q)$ is compared with $α_I(q)$ measured by the ghost-gluon vertex in Coulomb gauge and $α_s(q)$ measured in Landau gauge. 
0808.01797	On the Production of Jets and Hadrons	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:S.Mukherjee (nee Banerjee)    	Abstract:  The ratio of the semivertical cone angles of the quark and gluon jets calculated in the statistical model is found to be in exact agreement with that derived from QCD.In hadron production also,the model's prediction of the power law type of behaviour for the inclusive distribtuion is strikingly close to the the corresponding experimental findings;these spectacular results are significant for the model to be realistic. 
0808.01798	Quantum Time-evolution in Qubit Readout Process with a Josephson Bifurcation Amplifier	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Hayato Nakano, Shiro Saito, Kouichi Semba, Hideaki Takayanagi	Abstract:  We analyzed the Josephson bifurcation amplifier (JBA) readout process of a superconducting qubit quantum mechanically. This was achieved by employing numerical analyses of the dynamics of the density operator of a driven nonlinear oscillator and a qubit coupled system during the measurement process. In purely quantum cases, the wavefunction of the JBA is trapped in a quasienergy-state, and bifurcation is impossible. Introducing decoherence enables us to reproduce the bifurcation with a finite hysteresis. Moreover, we discuss in detail the dynamics involved when a qubit is initially in a superposition state. We have observed the qubit-probe (JBA) entangled state and it is divided into two separable states at the moment of the JBA transition begins. This corresponds to "projection". To readout the measurement result, however, we must wait until the two JBA states are macroscopically well separated. The waiting time is determined by the strength of the decoherence in the JBA. 
0808.01799	BRST Exact Action For N=1, D=4, Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:A. Aidaoui, M. Tahiri	Abstract:  The action for classical and consequently quantum N=1, D=4, supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories is proven to be written as a BRST exact term. In order to show this, the space of fields in the theory must be enlarged to include an extrafield as a non dynamical auxiliary field. 
0808.01800	Renormalization of O(N) model in 1/N expansion in auxiliary field formalism	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:A. Jakovac	Abstract:  We study the renormalization of the O(N) model using the auxiliary field formalism (Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation) in the 1/N expansion at finite temperature. We provide the general strategy of renormalization for arbitrary order, and make calculation up to next-to-leading order. We show that renormalization is possible for any values of the condensates, prove the temperature independence of the counterterms and determine the cutoff dependence of the first nontrivial counterterm parts. 
0808.01801	Multidirectional analysis of the oscillating (T = 24 hours) Earth's electric field recorded on ground surface	Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)	Authors:C. Thanassoulas, V. Klentos, G. Verveniotis	Abstract:  The Earth's preseismic oscillating (T = 24h) electric field recorded for a short-time period of some days is analyzed in terms of its intensity vector azimuthal direction calculated at one monitoring site. The calculated azimuthal directions are compared to the concurrent seismicity observed for the same period of time. Examples are presented for proving the agreement between the electric field intensity vectors calculated azimuths and the corresponding ones referring to the EQs - monitoring site location. Finally, an example is presented on account of the use of this methodology upon three different monitoring sites for the utilization of the estimation of the epicentral area of a large future EQ at the Methoni, Greece seismogenic area. 
0808.01802	Compute and Storage Clouds Using Wide Area High Performance Networks	Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)	Authors:Robert L. Grossman, Yunhong Gu, Michael Sabala, Wanzhi Zhang	Abstract:  We describe a cloud based infrastructure that we have developed that is optimized for wide area, high performance networks and designed to support data mining applications. The infrastructure consists of a storage cloud called Sector and a compute cloud called Sphere. We describe two applications that we have built using the cloud and some experimental studies. 
0808.01803	Jet modification in 200 AGeV Au-Au collisions	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Thorsten Renk	Abstract:  The computation of hard processes in hadronic collisions is a major success of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. The environment of heavy-ion collisions offers the opportunity to embed such hard processes into a soft medium which is created simultaneously and study the medium-induced modifications. On the level of single high transverse momentum hadrons, a reduction in yield, the so-called quenching is observed. However, on the level of jets, the energy-momentum flux carried by hadrons is conserved, i.e. the effect of the medium is a redistribution of energy and momentum, and statements about quenching of jets can only be made for specific cuts used to identify the jet. In this paper, we present a baseline computation for the expected modification of the longitudinal momentum distribution in jets by the medium created in 200 AGeV Au-Au collisions given a realistic set of experimental cuts used to identify jets in a heavy-iron environment. For this purpose, we use a Monte-Carlo code developed to simulate in-medium shower evolution following a hard process and a 3-d hydrodynamical evolution to simulate the soft medium. 
0808.01804	Parity Violating Effects in Elastic Electron Deuteron Scattering	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:S. Ahmad, S.K. Singh, H. Arenhoevel	Abstract:  The general expressions for parity violation observables in elastic scattering of polarized and/or unpolarized electrons from unpolarized deuterons are given and are numerically evaluated for the kinematics of SAMPLE, PVA4 and G0 experiments. The dominant contribution from the interference of $γ$ and Z exchange as well as the smaller contributions from strangeness ($s{\bar{s}}$) components of the nucleon, parity odd admixtures in the deuteron wave function, anapole moments and radiative corrections are included and discussed in the context of parity violating electron scattering experiments of present interest. 
0808.01805	Entropy of the FRW cosmology based on the brick wall method	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Wontae Kim, Edwin J. Son, Myungseok Yoon	Abstract:  The brick wall method in calculations of the entropy of black holes can be applied to the FRW cosmology in order to study the statistical entropy. An appropriate cutoff satisfying the covariant entropy bound can be chosen so that the entropy has a definite bound. Among the entropy for each of cosmological eras, the vacuum energy-dominated era turns out to give the maximal entropy which is in fact compatible with assumptions from the brick wall method. 
0808.01806	Ballistic propagation of thermal excitations near a vortex in superfluid He3-B	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:C.F. Barenghi, Y.A. Sergeev, N. Suramlishvili	Abstract:  Andreev scattering of thermal excitations is a powerful tool for studying quantized vortices and turbulence in superfluid He3-B at very low temperatures. We write Hamilton's equations for a quasiparticle in the presence of a vortex line, determine its trajectory, and find under wich conditions it is Andreev reflected. To make contact with experiments, we generalize our results to the Onsager vortex gas, and find values of the intervortex spacing in agreement with less rigorous estimates. 
0808.01807	Double-Lepton Polarization Asymmetries and Polarized Forward Backward Asymmetries in the Rare b \to s \ell^+ \ell^- Decays in a Single Universal Extra Dimension Scenario	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:V. Bashiry, M. Bayar, K. Azizi	Abstract:  We study the double-lepton polarization asymmetries and single and double-lepton polarization forward backward asymmetries of the rare b \to s \ell^+ \ell^- mode within the Standard Model and in the Appelquist-Cheng-Dobrescu model, which is a new physics scenario with a single universal extra dimension. In particular, we examine the sensitivity of the observables to the radius R of the compactified extra-dimension, which is the new parameter in this new physics model. 
0808.01808	Conflations of Probability Distributions	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Theodore P. Hill	Abstract:  The conflation of a finite number of probability distributions P_1,..., P_n is a consolidation of those distributions into a single probability distribution Q=Q(P_1,..., P_n), where intuitively Q is the conditional distribution of independent random variables X_1,..., X_n with distributions P_1,..., P_n, respectively, given that X_1= ... =X_n. Thus, in large classes of distributions the conflation is the distribution determined by the normalized product of the probability density or probability mass functions. Q is shown to be the unique probability distribution that minimizes the loss of Shannon Information in consolidating the combined information from P_1,..., P_n into a single distribution Q, and also to be the optimal consolidation of the distributions with respect to two minimax likelihood-ratio criteria. When P_1,..., P_n are Gaussian, Q is Gaussian with mean the classical weighted-mean-squares reciprocal of variances. A version of the classical convolution theorem holds for conflations of a large class of a.c. measures. 
0808.01809	Observation of an Orbital Selective Electron-Mode Coupling in Fe-Based High-$T_c$ Superconductors	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:P. Richard, T. Sato, K. Nakayama, S. Souma, T. Takahashi, Y.-M. Xu, G. F. Chen, J. L. Luo, N. L. Wang, H. Ding	Abstract:  We have performed an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of the new superconductor Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ in the low energy range. We report the observation of an anomaly around 25 meV in the dispersion of superconducting Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ samples that nearly vanishes above $T_c$. The energy scale of the related mode (13$\pm$2 meV) and its strong dependence on orbital and temperature indicates that it is unlikely related to phonons. Moreover, the momentum locations of the kink can be connected by the antiferromagnetic wavevector. Our results point towards an unconventional electronic origin of the mode and the superconducting pairing in the Fe-based superconductors, and strongly support the anti-phase s-wave pairing symmetry. 
0808.01810	In-gap state and effect of light illumination in CuIr$_2$S$_4$ probed by photoemission spectroscopy	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:K. Takubo, T. Mizokawa, N. Matsumoto, S. Nagata	Abstract:  We have studied disorder-induced in-gap states and effect of light illumination in the insulating phase of spinel-type CuIr$_2$S$_4$ using ultra-violet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS). The Ir$^{3+}$/Ir$^{4+}$ charge-ordered gap appears below the metal-insulator transition temperature. However, in the insulating phase, in-gap spectral features with $softgap$ are observed in UPS just below the Fermi level ($E_F$), corresponding to the variable range hopping transport observed in resistivity. The spectral weight at $E_F$ is not increased by light illumination, indicating that the Ir$^{4+}$-Ir$^{4+}$ dimer is very robust although the long-range octamer order would be destructed by the photo-excitation. Present results suggest that the Ir$^{4+}$-Ir$^{4+}$ bipolaronic hopping and disorder effects are responsible for the conductivity of CuIr$_2$S$_4$. 
0808.01811	The Cold Spot as a Large Void: Rees-Sciama effect on CMB Power Spectrum and Bispectrum	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Isabella Masina, Alessio Notari	Abstract:  The detection of a "Cold Spot" in the CMB sky could be explained by the presence of an anomalously large spherical underdense region (with radius of a few hundreds Mpc/h) located between us and the Last Scattering Surface. Modeling such an underdensity with an LTB metric, we investigate whether it could produce significant signals on the CMB power spectrum and bispectrum, via the Rees-Sciama effect. We find that this leads to a bump on the power spectrum, that corresponds to an O(5%-25%) correction at multipoles 5 < l < 50; in the cosmological fits, this would modify the χ^2 by an amount of order unity. We also find that the signal should be visible in the bispectrum coefficients with a signal-to-noise S/N ~ O (1-10), localized at 10 < l < 40. Such a signal would lead to an overestimation of the primordial f_{NL} by an amount Δf_{NL} ~ 1 for WMAP and by Δf_{NL} ~ 0.1 for Planck. 
0808.01812	Near-Infrared Photometry and Radio Continuum Study of the Massive Star Forming Regions IRAS 21413+5442 and IRAS 21407+5441	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:B.G. Anandarao, V. Venkata Raman, S.K. Ghosh, D.K. Ojha, M.S.N. Kumar	Abstract:  IRAS 21413+5442 and IRAS 21407+5441 are two massive star forming regions of high luminosity, likely associated with each other. Near-infrared photometry on these two IRAS sources was performed at UKIRT using the UFTI under excellent seeing conditions yielding an angular resolution of $\sim$ 0.5 arcsec. Our results reveal details of stellar content to a completeness limit (90%) of J = 18.5, H = 18.0, and K = 17.5 mag in the two regions. In IRAS 21413+5442, we identify a late O type star, having large (H-K) color, to be near the centre of the CO jets observed by earlier authors. The UKIRT images reveal in IRAS 21407+5441, a faint but clear compact HII region around a central high - intermediate mass star cluster. We have detected a number of sources with large (H-K) color which are not detected in J band. We also present the GMRT radio continuum map at 1.28 GHz covering the entire region surrounding the two star forming clouds. The radio continuum fluxes are used to estimate the properties of HII regions which seem to support our near-IR photometric results. Based on our radio continuum map and the archival MSX 8.2 $μ$m image, we show that the two IRAS sources likely belong to the same parent molecular cloud and conjecture that a high mass star of large IR colors, present in between the two sources, might have triggered star formation in this region. However one can not rule out the alternative possibility that Star A could be a nearby foreground star. 
0808.01813	Shellability and the strong gcd-condition	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Alexander Berglund	Abstract:  Shellability is a well-known combinatorial criterion for verifying that a simplicial complex is Cohen-Macaulay. Another notion familiar to commutative algebraists, but which has not received as much attention from combinatorialists as the Cohen-Macaulay property, is the notion of a Golod ring. Recently, a criterion on simplicial complexes reminiscent of shellability, called the strong gcd-condition, was shown to imply Golodness of the associated Stanley-Reisner ring. The two algebraic notions were tied together by Herzog, Reiner and Welker who showed that if the Alexander dual of a complex is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay then the complex itself is Golod. In this paper, we present a combinatorial companion of this result, namely that if the Alexander dual of a complex is (non-pure) shellable then the complex itself satisfies the strong gcd-condition. Moreover, we show that all implications just mentioned are strict in general but that they are equivalences for flag complexes. 
0808.01814	Computing with almost periodic functions	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:R.V. Moody, M. Nesterenko, J. Patera	Abstract:  The paper develops a method for discrete computational Fourier analysis of functions defined on quasicrystals and other almost periodic sets. A key point is to build the analysis around the emerging theory of quasicrystals and diffraction in the setting on local hulls and dynamical systems. Numerically computed approximations arising in this way are built out of the Fourier module of the quasicrystal in question, and approximate their target functions uniformly on the entire infinite space. The methods are entirely group theoretical, being based on finite groups and their duals, and they are practical and computable. Examples of functions based on the standard Fibonacci quasicrystal serve to illustrate the method (which is applicable to all quasicrystals modeled on the cut and project formalism). 
0808.01815	Braneworld Models of Scalar Fields with Generalized Dynamics	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:D. Bazeia, A.R. Gomes, L. Losano, R. Menezes	Abstract:  This work deals with braneworld models driven by real scalar fields with nonstandard dynamics. We develop the first-order formalism for models with standard gravity but with the scalar fields having generalized dynamics. We illustrate the results with examples of current interest, and we find analytical and numerical solutions for warp factors and scalar fields. The results indicate that the generalized braneworld scenario is classically stable, and capable of localizing gravity 
0808.01816	Reduced fidelity susceptibility in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Jian Ma, Lei Xu, Xiaoguang Wang	Abstract:  We study critical behaviors of the reduced fidelity susceptibility for two neighboring sites in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. It is found that the divergent behaviors of the susceptibility take the form of square of logarithm, in contrast with the global ground-state fidelity susceptibility which is power divergence. In order to perform a scaling analysis, we take the square root of the susceptibility and determine the scaling exponent analytically and the result is further confirmed by numerical calculations. 
0808.01817	Reduced fidelity approach for quantum phase transitions in spin-1/2 dimerized Heisenberg chains	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Heng-Na Xiong, Jian Ma, Zhe Sun, Xiaoguang Wang	Abstract:  We use reduced fidelity approach to characterize quantum phase transitions in the one-dimensional spin-1/2 dimerized Heisenberg chain in the antiferromagnetic case. The reduced fidelity susceptibilities between two nearest-neighboring spin pairs are considered. We find that they are directly related to the square of the second derivative of the ground-state energy. This enables us to conclude that the former might be a more effective indicator of the second-order quantum phase transitions than the latter. Two further exemplifications are given to confirm the conclusion is available for a broad class of systems with SU(2) and translation symmetries. Moreover, a general connection between reduced fidelity susceptibility and quantum phase transitions is illustrated. 
0808.01818	Spherical conjugacy classes and Bruhat decomposition	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Giovanna Carnovale	Abstract:  Let G be a connected, reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero or good and odd. We characterize the spherical conjugacy classes of G as those intersecting only Bruhat cells corresponding to involutions in the Weyl group of G. 
0808.01819	Electric Dipole Moments in the MSSM Reloaded	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:John Ellis, Jae Sik Lee, Apostolos Pilaftsis	Abstract:  We present a detailed study of the Thallium, neutron, Mercury and deuteron electric dipole moments (EDMs) in the CP-violating Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). We take into account the complete set of one-loop graphs, the dominant Higgs-mediated two-loop diagrams, the complete CP-odd dimension-six Weinberg operator and the Higgs-mediated four-fermion operators. We improve upon earlier calculations by including the resummation effects due to CP-violating Higgs-boson mixing and to threshold corrections to the Yukawa couplings of all up- and down-type quarks and charged leptons. As an application of our study, we analyse the EDM constraints on the CPX, trimixing and Maximally CP- and Minimally Flavour-Violating (MCPMFV) scenarios. Cancellations may occur among the CP-violating contributions to the three measured EDMs arising from the 6 CP-violating phases in the MCPMFV scenario, leaving open the possibility of relatively large contributions to other CP-violating observables. The analytic expressions for the EDMs are implemented in an updated version of the code CPsuperH2.0. 
0808.01820	Sheaves of ordered spaces and interval theories	Algebraic Topology (math.AT)	Authors:Krzysztof Worytkiewicz	Abstract:  We study the homotopy theory of locally ordered spaces, that is manifolds with boundary whose charts are partially ordered in a compatible way. Their category is not particularly well-behaved with respect to colimits. However, this category turns out to be a certain full subcategory of a topos of sheaves over a simpler site. A precise characterisation of this subcategory is provided. The ambient topos makes available some general homotopical machinery. 
0808.01821	Relations between the leading terms of a polynomial automorphism	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Philippe Bonnet, Stéphane Vénéreau	Abstract:  Let $I$ be the ideal of relations between the leading terms of the polynomials defining an automorphism of $K^n$. In this paper, we prove the existence of a locally nilpotent derivation which preserves $I$. Moreover, if $I$ is principal, i.e. $I=(R)$, we compute an upper bound for $°_2(R)$ for some degree function $°_2$ defined by the automorphism. As applications, we determine all the principal ideals of relations for automorphisms of $K^3$ and deduce two elementary proofs of the Jung-van der Kulk Theorem about the tameness of automorphisms of $K^{2}$. 
0808.01822	Fourier analysis, linear programming, and densities of distance avoiding sets in R^n	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Fernando Mario de Oliveira Filho, Frank Vallentin	Abstract:  In this paper we derive new upper bounds for the densities of measurable sets in R^n which avoid a finite set of prescribed distances. The new bounds come from the solution of a linear programming problem. We apply this method to obtain new upper bounds for measurable sets which avoid the unit distance in dimensions 2,..., 24. This gives new lower bounds for the measurable chromatic number in dimensions 3,..., 24. We apply it to get a new, short proof of a variant of a recent result of Bukh which in turn generalizes theorems of Furstenberg, Katznelson, Weiss and Bourgain and Falconer about sets avoiding many distances. 
0808.01823	Optimal Time Evolution for Hermitian and Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Carl M. Bender, Dorje C. Brody	Abstract:  Consider the set of all Hamiltonians whose largest and smallest energy eigenvalues, E_max and E_min, differ by a fixed energy ω. Given two quantum states, an initial state |ψ_I> and a final state |ψ_F>, there exist many Hamiltonians H belonging to this set under which |ψ_I> evolves in time into |ψ_F>. Which Hamiltonian transforms the initial state to the final state in the least possible time τ? For Hermitian Hamiltonians, $τ$ has a nonzero lower bound. However, among complex non-Hermitian PT-symmetric Hamiltonians satisfying the same energy constraint, τcan be made arbitrarily small without violating the time-energy uncertainty principle. The minimum value of τcan be made arbitrarily small because for PT-symmetric Hamiltonians the evolution path from the vector |ψ_I> to the vector |ψ_F>, as measured using the Hilbert-space metric appropriate for this theory, can be made arbitrarily short. The mechanism described here resembles the effect in general relativity in which two space-time points can be made arbitrarily close if they are connected by a wormhole. This result may have applications in quantum computing. 
0808.01824	Constraining Lorentz violation with cosmology	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:J.A. Zuntz, P.G. Ferreira, T.G. Zlosnik	Abstract:  The Einstein-Aether theory provides a simple, dynamical mechanism for breaking Lorentz invariance. It does so within a generally covariant context and may emerge from quantum effects in more fundamental theories. The theory leads to a preferred frame and can have distinct experimental signatures. In this letter, we perform a comprehensive study of the cosmological effects of the Einstein-Aether theory and use observational data to constrain it. Allied to previously determined consistency and experimental constraints, we find that an Einstein-Aether universe can fit experimental data over a wide range of its parameter space, but requires a specific rescaling of the other cosmological densities. 
0808.01825	Electroweak Physics with ATLAS	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Arif Akhundov	Abstract:  The precision measurements of electroweak parameters of the Standard Model with the ATLAS detector at LHC are reviewed. An emphasis is put on the bridge connecting the ATLAS measurements with the SM analysis at LEP/SLC and the Tevatron. 
0808.01826	Precision measurement of light shifts at two off-resonant wavelengths in a single trapped Ba+ ion and determination of atomic dipole matrix elements	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:J. A. Sherman, A. Andalkar, W. Nagourney, E. N. Fortson	Abstract:  We define and measure the ratio (R) of the vector ac-Stark effect (or light shift) in the 6S_1/2 and 5D_3/2 states of a single trapped barium ion to 0.2% accuracy at two different off-resonant wavelengths. We earlier found R = -11.494(13) at 514.531nm and now report the value at 1111.68nm, R = +0.4176(8). These observations together yield a value of the <5D||er||4F> matrix element, previously unknown in the literature. Also, comparison of our results with an ab initio calculation of dynamic polarizability would yield a new test of atomic theory and improve the understanding of atomic structure needed to interpret a proposed atomic parity violation experiment. 
0808.01827	Subgroups of free idempotent generated semigroups need not be free	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Mark Brittenham, Stuart W. Margolis, John Meakin	Abstract:  We use topological methods to study the maximal subgroups of the free idempotent generated semigroup on a biordered set. We use these to give an example of a free idempotent generated semigroup with maximal subgroup isomorphic to the free abelian group of rank 2. This is the first example of a non-free subgroup of a free idempotent generated semigroup. 
0808.01828	Theory of Zipf's Law and of General Power Law Distributions with Gibrat's law of Proportional Growth	General Finance (q-fin.GN)	Authors:A. Saichev, Y. Malevergne, D. Sornette	Abstract:  We summarize a book under publication with his title written by the three present authors, on the theory of Zipf's law, and more generally of power laws, driven by the mechanism of proportional growth. The preprint is available upon request from the authors. For clarity, consistence of language and conciseness, we discuss the origin and conditions of the validity of Zipf's law using the terminology of firms' asset values. We use firms at the entities whose size distributions are to be explained. It should be noted, however, that most of the relations discussed in this book, especially the intimate connection between Zipf's and Gilbrat's laws, underlie Zipf's law in diverse scientific areas. The same models and variations thereof can be straightforwardly applied to any of the other domains of application. 
0808.01829	Note on the Euler Numbers and Polynomials	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Taekyun Kim	Abstract:  In this paper we investigate the properties of the Euler functions. By using the Fourier transform for the Euler function, we derive the interesting formula related to the infinite series. Finally we give some interesting identities between the Euler numbers and the second kind stirling numbers. 
0808.01830	Convective dust clouds in a complex plasma	Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)	Authors:S. Mitic, R. Suetterlin, A.V.Ivlev, H. Hoefner, M.H. Thoma, S. Zhdanov, G. E. Morfill	Abstract:  The plasma is generated in a low frequency glow discharge within an elongated glass tube oriented vertically. The dust particles added to the plasma are confined above the heater and form counter-rotating clouds close to the tube centre. The shape of the clouds and the velocity field of the conveying dust particles are determined. The forces acting on the particles are calculated. It is shown that convection of the dust is affected by the convective gas motion which is triggered, in turn, by thermal creep of the gas along the inhomogeneously heated walls of the tube. 
0808.01831	Geometry of effective Hamiltonians	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Simen Kvaal	Abstract:  We give a complete geometrical description of the effective Hamiltonians common in nuclear shell model calculations. By recasting the theory in a manifestly geometric form, we reinterpret and clarify several points. Some of these results are hitherto unknown or unpublished. In particular, commuting observables and symmetries are discussed in detail. Simple and explicit proofs are given, and numerical algorithms are proposed, that improve and stabilize common methods used today. 
0808.01832	First bounds on the high-energy emission from isolated Wolf-Rayet binary systems	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:MAGIC Collaboration: E. Aliu, et al    	Abstract:  High-energy gamma-ray emission is theoretically expected to arise in tight binary star systems (with high mass loss and high velocity winds), although the evidence of this relationship has proven to be elusive so far. Here we present the first bounds on this putative emission from isolated Wolf-Rayet (WR) star binaries, WR 147 and WR 146, obtained from observations with the MAGIC telescope. 
0808.01833	Energy Gaps and Stark Effect in Boron Nitride Nanoribbons	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Cheol-Hwan Park, Steven G. Louie	Abstract:  A first-principles investigation of the electronic properties of boron nitride nanoribbons (BNNRs) having either armchair or zigzag shaped edges passivated by hydrogen with widths up to 10 nm is presented. Band gaps of armchair BNNRs exhibit family-dependent oscillations as the width increases and, for ribbons wider than 3 nm, converge to a constant value that is 0.02 eV smaller than the bulk band gap of a boron nitride sheet owing to the existence of very weak edge states. The band gap of zigzag BNNRs monotonically decreases and converges to a gap that is 0.7 eV smaller than the bulk gap due to the presence of strong edge states. When a transverse electric field is applied, the band gaps of armchair BNNRs decrease monotonically with the field strength. For the zigzag BNNRs, however, the band gaps and the carrier effective masses either increase or decrease depending on the direction and the strength of the field. 
0808.01834	Diffusion of cosmic-rays and the Gamma-ray Large Area Telescope: Phenomenology at the 1-100 GeV regime	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ana Y. Rodriguez Marrero, Diego F. Torres, Elsa de Cea del Pozo, Olaf Reimer, Analia N. Cillis	Abstract:  This paper analyzes astrophysical scenarios that may be detected at the upper end of the energy range of the Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), as a result of cosmic-ray (CR) diffusion in the interstellar medium (ISM). Hadronic processes are considered as the source of $γ$-ray photons from localized molecular enhancements nearby accelerators. Two particular cases are presented: a) the possibility of detecting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with maxima above 1 GeV, which may be constrained by detection or non-detection at very-high energies (VHE) with observations by ground-based Cerenkov telescopes, and b) the possibility of detecting V-shaped, inverted spectra, due to confusion of a nearby (to the line of sight) arrangement of accelerator/target scenarios with different characteristic properties. We show that the finding of these signatures (in particular, a peak at the 1--100 GeV energy region) is indicative for an identification of the underlying mechanism producing the $γ$-rays that is realized by nature: which accelerator (age and relative position to the target cloud) and under which diffusion properties CR propagate. 
0808.01835	Fibered nonlinearities for $p(x)$-Laplace equations	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Milena Chermisi, Enrico Valdinoci	Abstract:  In $\R^m\times\R^{n-m}$, endowed with coordinates $X=(x,y)$, we consider the PDE $$ -{\rm div} \big(α(\x) |\nabla u(\X)|^{p(x)-2}\nabla u(\X)\big)=f(x,u(\X)).$$ We prove a geometric inequality and a symmetry result. 
0808.01836	Primitive Collections and Toric Varieties	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:David A. Cox, Christine von Renesse	Abstract:  This paper studies Batyrev's notion of primitive collection. We use primitive collections to characterize the nef cone of a quasi-projective toric variety whose fan has convex support, a result stated without proof by Batyrev in the smooth projective case. When the fan is non-simplicial, we modify the definition of primitive collection and explain how our definition relates to primitive collections of simplicial subdivisons. The paper ends with some open problems. 
0808.01837	Universal holographic hydrodynamics at finite coupling	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Alex Buchel, Robert C. Myers, Miguel F. Paulos, Aninda Sinha	Abstract:  We consider thermal plasmas in a large class of superconformal gauge theories described by a holographic dual geometry of the form $AdS_5\times M_5$. In particular, we demonstrate that all of the thermodynamic properties and hydrodynamic transport parameters for a large class of superconformal gauge theories exhibit a certain universality to leading order in the inverse 't Hooft coupling and $1/N_c$. In particular, we show that independent of the compactification geometry, the leading corrections are derived from the same five-dimensional effective supergravity action supplemented by a term quartic in the five-dimensional Weyl tensor. 
0808.01838	Measurement of the Branching Fractions of the Radiative Charm Decays $D^{0} \to {\bar K}^{*0} γ$ and $D^{0} \to φγ$	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We present a measurement of the branching fractions for the Cabibbo-favored radiative decay, $D^{0} \to {\bar K}^{*0} γ$, and the Cabibbo-suppressed radiative decay, $D^{0} \to φγ$. These measurements are based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $387.1 fb^{-1}$, recorded with the BaBar detector at the PEP-II $e^+e^-$ asymmetric-energy collider operating at center-of-mass energies 10.58 and 10.54 GeV. We measure the branching fractions relative to the well-studied decay $D^{0} \to K^{-} π^{+}$ and find ${\cal B}(D^{0} \to {\bar K}^{*0} γ)/{\cal B}(D^{0} \to K^{-} π^{+}) = (8.43 \pm 0.51 \pm 0.70) \times 10^{-3}$ and ${\cal B}(D^{0} \to φγ)/{\cal B}(D^{0} \to K^{-} π^{+}) = (7.15 \pm 0.78 \pm 0.69) \times 10^{-4}$, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. This is the first measurement of ${\cal B}(D^{0} \to {\bar K}^{*0} γ)$. 
0808.01839	Velocity Curve Analysis of the Spectroscopic Binary Stars NSV 223, AB And, V2082 Cyg, HS Her, V918 Her, BV Dra, BW Dra, V2357 Oph, and YZ Cas by the Non-linear Least Squares	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:K. Karami, R. Mohebi, M. M. Soltanzadeh	Abstract:  Using measured radial velocity data of nine double lined spectroscopic binary systems NSV 223, AB And, V2082 Cyg, HS Her, V918 Her, BV Dra, BW Dra, V2357 Oph, and YZ Cas, we find corresponding orbital and spectroscopic elements via the method introduced by Karami & Mohebi (2007a) and Karami & Teimoorinia (2007). Our numerical results are in good agreement with those obtained by others using more traditional methods. 
0808.01840	Beyond bilinear controllability : applications to quantum control	Numerical Analysis (math.NA)	Authors:Gabriel Turinici (CEREMADE)    	Abstract:  Quantum control is traditionally expressed through bilinear models and their associated Lie algebra controllability criteria. But, the first order approximation are not always sufficient and higher order developpements are used in recent works. Motivated by these applications, we give in this paper a criterion that applies to situations where the evolution operator is expressed as sum of possibly non-linear real functionals of the control that multiplies some time independent (coupling) operators. 
0808.01841	The Morphology of Collisionless Galactic Rings Exterior to Evolving Bars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Micaela Bagley, Ivan Minchev, Alice C. Quillen (U Rochester)    	Abstract:  The morphology of the outer rings of early-type spiral galaxies is compared to integrations of massless collisionless particles initially in nearly circular orbits. Particles are perturbed by a quadrupolar gravitational potential corresponding to a growing and secularly evolving bar. We find that outer rings with R1R2 morphology and pseudorings are exhibited by the simulations even though they lack gaseous dissipation. Simulations with stronger bars form pseudorings earlier and more quickly than those with weaker bars. We find that the R1 ring, perpendicular to the bar, is fragile and dissolves after a few bar rotation periods if the bar pattern speed increases by more than ~ 8%, bar strength increases (by >~ 140%) after bar growth, or the bar is too strong (Q_T>0.3). If the bar slows down after formation, pseudoring morphology persists and the R2 ring perpendicular to the bar is populated due to resonance capture. The R2 ring remains misaligned with the bar and increases in ellipticity as the bar slows down. The R2 ring becomes scalloped and does not resemble any ringed galaxies if the bar slows down more than 3.5% suggesting that bars decrease in strength before they slow down this much. We compare the morphology of our simulations to B-band images of 9 ringed galaxies from the Ohio State University Bright Spiral Galaxy Survey, and we find a reasonable match in morphologies to R1R2' pseudorings seen within a few bar rotation periods of bar formation. Some of the features previously interpreted in terms of dissipative models may be due to transient structure associated with recent bar growth and evolution. 
0808.01842	Quantum fields as gravitational sources	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:Mark J Hadley	Abstract:  The practice of setting quantum fields as sources for classical general relativity is examined. Several conceptual problems are identified which invalidate apparently innocuous equations. Alternative ways to links classical general relativity with quantum theory using Bohm's theory are proposed. 
0808.01843	Intrinsic geometry of oriented congruences in three dimensions	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:C Denson Hill, Pawel Nurowski	Abstract:  Starting from the classical notion of an oriented congruence (i.e. a foliation by oriented curves) in $R^3$, we abstract the notion of an oriented congruence structure. This is a 3-dimensional CR manifold $(M,H, J)$ with a preferred splitting of the tangent space $TM=V\oplus H$. We find all local invariants of such structures using Cartan's equivalence method refining Cartan's classification of 3-dimensional CR structures. We use these invariants and perform Fefferman like constructions, to obtain interesting Lorentzian metrics in four dimensions, which include explicit Ricci-flat and Einstein metrics, as well as not conformally Einstein Bach-flat metrics. 
0808.01844	A test suite for quantitative comparison of hydrodynamics codes in astrophysics	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Elizabeth J. Tasker (1), Riccardo Brunino (2), Nigel L. Mitchell (3), Dolf Michielsen (2), Stephen Hopton (2), Frazer R. Pearce (2), Greg L. Bryan (4), Tom Theuns (3) ((1) University of Florida, (2) University of Nottingham, (3) University of Durham, (4) Columbia University)    	Abstract:  We test four commonly used astrophysical simulation codes; Enzo, Flash, Gadget and Hydra, using a suite of numerical problems with analytic initial and final states. Situations similar to the conditions of these tests, a Sod shock, a Sedov blast and both a static and translating King sphere occur commonly in astrophysics, where the accurate treatment of shocks, sound waves, supernovae explosions and collapsed haloes is a key condition for obtaining reliable validated simulations. We demonstrate that comparable results can be obtained for Lagrangian and Eulerian codes by requiring that approximately one particle exists per grid cell in the region of interest. We conclude that adaptive Eulerian codes, with their ability to place refinements in regions of rapidly changing density, are well suited to problems where physical processes are related to such changes. Lagrangian methods, on the other hand, are well suited to problems where large density contrasts occur and the physics is related to the local density itself rather than the local density gradient. 
0808.01845	The Longitudinal Structure Function at HERA	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:R. S. Thorne	Abstract:  I investigate the theoretical uncertainties on the predictions for the longitudinal structure function. I compare the predictions using fixed-order perturbative QCD, higher twist corrections, small-x resummations and the dipole picture. I compare the various predictions to the recent HERA measurements and examine how the data still to be analysed may discriminate between the approaches. 
0808.01846	Theory of edge radiation	Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph)	Authors:Gianluca Geloni, Vitali Kocharyan, Evgeni Saldin, Evgeni Schneidmiller, Mikhail Yurkov	Abstract:  We formulate a complete theory of Edge Radiation based on a novel method relying on Fourier Optics techniques. Similar types of radiation like Transition Undulator Radiation are addressed in the framework of the same formalism. Special attention is payed in discussing the validity of approximations upon which the theory is built. Our study makes consistent use of both similarity techniques and comparisons with numerical results from simulation. We discuss both near and far zone. Physical understanding of many asymptotes is discussed. Based on the solution of the field equation with a tensor Green's function technique, we also discuss an analytical model to describe the presence of a vacuum chamber. In particular, explicit calculations for a circular vacuum chamber are reported. Finally, we consider the use of Edge Radiation as a tool for electron beam diagnostics. We discuss Coherent Edge Radiation, Extraction of Edge Radiation by a mirror, and other issues becoming important at high electron energy and long radiation wavelength. Based on this work we also study the impact of Edge Radiation on XFEL setups and we discuss recent results. 
0808.01847	Parton Distributions and QCD at LHCb	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:R.S. Thorne, A.D. Martin, W.J. Stirling, G. Watt	Abstract:  We consider the impact that can be made on our understanding of parton distributions (PDFs) and QCD from early measurements at the LHCb experiment. The high rapidity values make the experiment uniquely suited to a detailed study of small-x parton distributions and hence will make a significant contribution towards the clarification of both experimental and theoretical uncertainties on PDFs and their applications. 
0808.01848	Luminosity-Colours relations for thin disc main-sequence stars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Bilir, S. Karaali, S. Ak, E. Yaz, A. Cabrera-Lavers, K. B. Coskunoglu	Abstract:  In this study we present the absolute magnitude calibrations of thin disc main-sequence stars in the optical ($M_{V}$), and in the near-infrared ($M_{J}$). Thin disc stars are identified by means of Padova isochrones, and absolute magnitudes for the sample are evaluated via the newly reduced Hipparcos data. The obtained calibrations cover a large range of spectral types: from A0 to M4 in the optical and from A0 to M0 in the near-infrared. Also, we discuss the of effects binary stars and evolved stars on the absolute magnitude calibrations. The usage of these calibrations can be extended to the estimation of galactic model parameters for the thin disc individually, in order to compare these parameters with the corresponding ones estimated by $χ{^2}_{min}$ statistics (which provides galactic model parameters for thin and thick discs, and halo simultaneously) to test any degeneracy between them. The calibrations can also be used in other astrophysical researches where distance plays an important role in that study. 
0808.01849	A general method of estimating stellar astrophysical parameters from photometry	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A.N. Belikov, S. Roeser	Abstract:  Applying photometric catalogs to the study of the population of the Galaxy is obscured by the impossibility to map directly photometric colors into astrophysical parameters. Most of all-sky catalogs like ASCC or 2MASS are based upon broad-band photometric systems, and the use of broad photometric bands complicates the determination of the astrophysical parameters for individual stars. This paper presents an algorithm for determining stellar astrophysical parameters (effective temperature, gravity and metallicity) from broad-band photometry even in the presence of interstellar reddening. This method suits the combination of narrow bands as well. We applied the method of interval-cluster analysis to finding stellar astrophysical parameters based on the newest Kurucz models calibrated with the use of a compiled catalog of stellar parameters. Our new method of determining astrophysical parameters allows all possible solutions to be located in the effective temperature-gravity-metallicity space for the star and selection of the most probable solution. 
0808.01850	Questions about determinants and polynomials	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Steve Fisk	Abstract:  We discuss several conjectures about the real-rootedness of polynomials whose coefficients are determinants of coefficients of a real-rooted polynomial. We also consider some questions about matrices generalizing totally positive matrices, namely totally stable matrices and totally upper matrices. 
0808.01851	Inverse Nodal Problems	Spectral Theory (math.SP)	Authors:David Klawonn	Abstract:  It is shown that nodal sequences determine the underlying manifold up to scaling within classes of rectangles with Dirichlet boundary conditions, separable two dimensional tori, two-dimensional flat Klein bottles and flat tori in two and three dimensions. 
0808.01852	The Meccano of life	Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)	Authors:Pierre Zofel, Barbara Zofel	Abstract:  This article is interested in the origin of the genetic code, it puts forward a scenario of a simultaneous selection of the bases and amino acids and setting up of a correlation between them. Each amino acid is associated with a pair of its own kind, called the binding pair and each binding pair is associated with the codon(s) corresponding to the same amino acid. An explanation is also proposed about the origin of the start and stop codons. 
0808.01853	Unit cell of graphene on Ru(0001): a 25 x 25 supercell with 1250 carbon atoms	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:D. Martoccia, P.R. Willmott, T. Brugger, M. Björck, S. Günther, C.M. Schlepütz, A. Cervellino, S.A. Pauli, B.D. Patterson, S. Marchini, J. Wintterlin, W. Moritz, T. Greber	Abstract:  The structure of a single layer of graphene on Ru(0001) has been studied using surface x-ray diffraction. A surprising superstructure has been determined, whereby 25 x 25 graphene unit cells lie on 23 x 23 unit cells of Ru. Each supercell contains 2 x 2 crystallographically inequivalent subcells caused by corrugation. Strong intensity oscillations in the superstructure rods demonstrate that the Ru substrate is also significantly corrugated down to several monolayers, and that the bonding between graphene and Ru is strong and cannot be caused by van der Waals bonds. Charge transfer from the Ru substrate to the graphene expands and weakens the C-C bonds, which helps accommodate the in-plane tensile stress. The elucidation of this superstructure provides important information in the potential application of graphene as a template for nanocluster arrays. 
0808.01854	Extraction of the proton parton density functions using a NLO-QCD fit of the combined H1 and ZEUS inclusive DIS cross sections	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:A M Cooper-Sarkar	Abstract:  The combined HERA-I data set, of neutral and charged current inclusive cross-sections for $e^+p$ and $e^-p$ scattering, is used as the sole input for a next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD parton distribution function (PDF) fit. The consistent treatment of systematic uncertainties in the joint data set ensures that experimental uncertainties on the PDFs can be calculated without need for an increased $χ^2$ tolerance. This results in PDFs with greatly reduced experimental uncertainties compared to the separate analyses of the ZEUS and H1 experiments. Model uncertainties, including those arising from parametrization dependence, are also carefully considered. The resulting HERAPDFs have impressive precision compared to the global fits. 
0808.01855	Warm Inflation and its Microphysical Basis	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Arjun Berera, Ian G. Moss, Rudnei O. Ramos	Abstract:  The microscopic quantum field theory origins of warm inflation dynamics are reviewed. The warm inflation scenario is first described along with its results, predictions and comparison with the standard cold inflation scenario. The basics of thermal field theory required in the study of warm inflation are discussed. Quantum field theory real time calculations at finite temperature are then presented and the derivation of dissipation and stochastic fluctuations are shown from a general perspective. Specific results are given of dissipation coefficients for a variety of quantum field theory interaction structures relevant to warm inflation, in a form that can readily be used by model builders. Different particle physics models realising warm inflation are presented along with their observational predictions. 
0808.01856	Including heavy quark production in ZEUS-PDF fits	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:A M Cooper-Sarkar	Abstract:  At HERA heavy quarks may contribute up to 30% of the structure function $F_2$. The potential of including heavy-quark data in the ZEUS PDF fits is explored, using $D^*$ double differential cross-sections as well as the inclusive quantities $F_2^{c\bar{c}}$, $F_2^{c\bar{c}}$. The introduction of heavy quarks requires an extension of the DGLAP formalism. The effect of using different heavy flavour number schemes, and different approaches to the running of $α_s$, are compared. 
0808.01857	Characterisation of the VELO High Voltage System	Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)	Authors:B. Rakotomiaramanana, C. Parkes, L. Eklund	Abstract:  The high voltage system supplies the bias voltage to the 88 silicon sensors which comprise the LHCb Vertex Locator (VELO). This note describes the results of the tests which have been performed on the hardware of the high voltage system of the VELO. Each individual test detailed in this note corresponds to a specific requirement of the system. These requirements arise primarily from ensuring the safety of the silicon sensors and the quality of the data taken from the VELO modules. The tests performed are in four categories: normal operation of the high voltage system; verification of its stability under operation; discussion of its behaviour in failure modes; and details of operation at low voltage. Noteworthy issues, identified through the tests, include the behaviour of the high voltage modules at voltages below 9V, the current limit that can be applied during ramping of the voltage, and the speed with which the voltage is cut during failures of the system. The results of these tests provide high confidence that the high voltage system can be safely used and demonstrate that low noise is produced by the power supplies. 
0808.01858	Weak amenability of Fourier algebras on compact groups	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Brian E. Forrest, Ebrahim Samei, Nico Spronk	Abstract:  We give for a compact group G, a full characterisation of when its Fourier algebra A(G) is weakly amenable: when the connected component of the identity G_e is abelian. This condition is also equivalent to the hyper-Tauberian property for A(G), and to having the anti-diagonal D^v={(s,s^{-1}):s is in G} being a set of spectral synthesis for A(GXG). We show the relationship between amenability and weak amenability of A(G), and (operator) amenability and (operator) weak amenability of A_D(G), an algebra defined by the authors in arXiv:0705.4277. We close by extending our results to some classes of non-compact, locally compact groups, including small invariant neighbourhood groups and maximally weakly almost periodic groups. 
0808.01859	Revisiting Critical Vortices in Three-Dimensional SQED	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:S. Olmez, M. Shifman	Abstract:  We consider renormalization of the central charge and the mass of the ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric Abelian vortices in 2+1 dimensions. We obtain ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric theory in 2+1 dimensions by dimensionally reducing the ${\cal N}=1$ SQED in 3+1 dimensions with two chiral fields carrying opposite charges. Then we introduce a mass for one of the matter multiplets without breaking N=2 supersymmetry. This massive multiplet is viewed as a regulator in the large mass limit. We show that the mass and the central charge of the vortex get the same nonvanishing quantum corrections, which preserves BPS saturation at the quantum level. Comparison with the operator form of the central extension exhibits fractionalization of a global U(1) charge; it becomes 1/2 for the minimal vortex. The very fact of the mass and charge renormalization is due to a "reflection" of an unbalanced number of the fermion and boson zero modes on the vortex in the regulator sector. 
0808.01860	Varieties with Definable Factor Congruences	Logic (math.LO)	Authors:Pedro Sánchez Terraf, Diego J. Vaggione	Abstract:  We study direct product representations of algebras in varieties. We collect several conditions expressing that these representations are "definable" in a first-order-logic sense, among them the concept of Definable Factor Congruences (DFC). The main results are that DFC is a Mal'cev property and that it is equivalent to all other conditions formulated; in particular we prove that V has DFC if and only if V has 0&1 and Boolean Factor Congruences. We also obtain an explicit first order definition of the kernel of the canonical projections via the terms associated to the Mal'cev condition for DFC, in such a manner it is preserved by taking direct products and direct factors. The main tool is the use of "central elements," which are a generalization of both central idempotent elements in rings with identity and neutral complemented elements in a bounded lattice. 
0808.01861	The role of the stress trap in polariton quasiequilibrium condensation in GaAs microcavities	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:R. Balili, B. Nelsen, D.W. Snoke, L. Pfeiffer, K. West	Abstract:  Recent experiments have shown several effects indicative of Bose-Einstein condensation in polaritons in GaAs-based microcavity structures when a harmonic potential trap for the two-dimensional polaritons is created by applied stress. These effects include both real-space and momentum-space narrowing, first-order coherence, and onset of linear polarization above a particle density threshold. Similar effects have been seen in systems without traps, raising the question of how important the role of the trap is in these experiments. In this paper we present results for both trapped conditions and resonant, non-trapped conditions in the same sample. We find that the results are qualitatively different, with two distinct types of transitions. At low density in the trap, the polaritons remain in the strong-coupling regime while going through the threshold for onset of coherence; at higher density, there is a different threshold behavior which occurs with weak coupling and can be identified with lasing; this transition occurs both with and without a trap. 
0808.01862	Observation of half-integer quantum Hall effect in single-layer graphene using pulse magnet	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Satoru Masubuchi, Ken-ichi Suga, Masashi Ono, Koichi Kindo, Shojiro Takeyama, Tomoki Machida	Abstract:  We report magnetotransport measurements on a single-layer graphene in pulsed magnetic fields up to $B$ = 53 T. With either electron- or hole-type charge carriers, the Hall resistance $R_{H}$ is quantized into $R_{H}$ = $(h/e^2)ν ^{-1}$ with $ν$ = $\pm$2, $\pm$6, and $\pm$10, which demonstrates the observation of half-integer quantum Hall effect (QHE). At $B$ = 50 T, the half-integer QHE is even observed at room temperature in spite of a conventional carrier mobility $μ$ = 4000 cm$^2$/Vs. 
0808.01863	Comments on Accretion of Phantom Fields by Black Holes and the Generalized Second Law	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J.A. de Freitas Pacheco	Abstract:  The thermodynamic properties of a phantom fluid and accretion by a black hole were recently revisited by Pereira (2008) and Lima et al. (2008). In order to keep positive both the entropy and the temperature, those authors assumed that the phantom fluid has a non null chemical potential. In this short not we will show that there is a flaw in their derivation of the thermodynamic state functions which invalidates their analysis and their conclusions concerning the accretion of a phantom fluid by a black hole. 
0808.01864	Epitaxial growth and anisotropy of La(O,F)FeAs thin films deposited by Pulsed Laser Deposition	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:E. Backen, S. Haindl, T. Niemeier, T. Freudenberg, J. Werner, G. Behr, L. Schultz, B. Holzapfel	Abstract:  LaFeAsO1-xFx thin films were deposited successfully on (001)-oriented LaAlO3 and MgO substrates from stoichiometric LaFeAsO1-xFx polycrystalline targets with fluorine concentrations up to x = 0.25 by PLD. Room temperature deposition and post annealing of the films yield nearly phase pure films with a pronounced c-axis texture and a strong biaxial in-plane orientation. Transport measurements show metallic resistance and onset of superconductivity at 11 K. Hc2(T) was determined by resistive measurements and yield Hc2 values of 3 T at 3.6 K for B||c and 6 T at 6.4 K for B||ab. 
0808.01865	Heteroclinic connections in plane Couette flow	Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)	Authors:Jonathan Halcrow, John F. Gibson, Predrag Cvitanović, Divakar Viswanath	Abstract:  Plane Couette flow transitions to turbulence for Re~325 even though the laminar solution with a linear profile is linearly stable for all Re (Reynolds number). One starting point for understanding this subcritical transition is the existence of invariant sets in the state space of the Navier Stokes equation, such as upper and lower branch equilibria and periodic and relative periodic solutions, that are quite distinct from the laminar solution. This article reports several heteroclinic connections between such objects and briefly describes a numerical method for locating heteroclinic connections. Computing such connections is essential for understanding the global dynamics of spatially localized structures that occur in transitional plane Couette flow. We show that the nature of streaks and streamwise rolls can change significantly along a heteroclinic connection. 
0808.01866	Measurements of time-dependent CP asymmetries in B0 --> D(*)+D(*)- decays	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We present new measurements of time-dependent CP asymmetries for B0 --> D(*)+D(*)- decays using (467 +/- 5) X 10^6 BB pairs collected with the BaBar detector located at the PEP-II B Factory at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. We determine the CP-odd fraction of the B0 --> D*+D*- decays to be R_perp = 0.158 +/- 0.028 +/- 0.006 and find CP asymmetry parameters for the CP-even component of the decay S_+ = -0.76 +/- 0.16 +/- 0.04 and C_+ = 0.00 +/- 0.12 +/- 0.02. We measure S = -0.63 +/- 0.36 +/- 0.05 and C = -0.07 +/- 0.23 +/- 0.03 for B0 --> D+D-, S = -0.62 +/- 0.21 +/- 0.03 and C = 0.08 +/- 0.17 +/- 0.04 for B0 --> D*+D-$, and S = -0.73 +/- 0.23 +/- 0.05 and C = 0.00 +/- 0.17 +/- 0.03 for B0 --> D+D*-. For the B0 --> D*+/-D-/+ decays, we also determine the CP-violating asymmetry A = 0.008 +/- 0.048 +/- 0.013. In each case, the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. The measured values for the asymmetries are all consistent with the Standard Model. 
0808.01867	Collider Searches for Extra Spatial Dimensions and Black Holes	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Greg Landsberg (Brown University)    	Abstract:  Searches for extra spatial dimensions remain among the most popular new directions in our quest for physics beyond the Standard Model. High-energy collider experiments of the current decade should be able to find an ultimate answer to the question of their existence in a variety of models. We review these models and recent results from the Tevatron on searches for large, inverse-TeV-size, and Randall-Sundrum extra spatial dimensions. The most dramatic consequence of low-scale (~1 TeV) quantum gravity is copious production of mini-black holes at the LHC. We discuss selected topics in the mini-black-hole phenomenology. 
0808.01868	Scaling exponents of Forced Polymer Translocation through a nano-pore	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Aniket Bhattacharya, William H. Morrison, Kaifu Luo, Tapio Ala-Nissila, See-Chen Ying, Andrey Milchev, Kurt Binder	Abstract:  We investigate several scaling properties of a translocating homopolymer through a thin pore driven by an external field present inside the pore only using Langevin Dynamics (LD) simulation in three dimension (3D). Specifically motivated by several recent theoretical and numerical studies that are apparently at odds with each other, we determine the chain length dependence of the scaling exponents of the average translocation time, the average velocity of the center of mass, $<v_{CM}>$, the effective radius of gyration during the translocation process, and the scaling exponent of the translocation coordinate ($s$-coordinate) as a function of the translocation time. We further discuss the possibility that in the case of driven translocation the finite pore size and its geometry could be responsible that the veclocity scaling exponent is less than unity and discuss the dependence of the scaling exponents on the pore geometry for the range of $N$ studied here. 
0808.01869	Modification of the aging dynamics of glassy polymers due to a temperature step	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Mya Warren, Joerg Rottler	Abstract:  Molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate the connection between thermal history and physical aging in polymer glasses, in particular the effects of a temperature square step. Measurements of two-time correlation functions show that a negative temperature step causes "rejuvenation" of the sample: the entire spectrum of relaxation times appears identical to a younger specimen that did not experience a temperature step. A positive temperature step, however, leads to significant changes in the relaxation times. At short times, the dynamics are accelerated (rejuvenation), whereas at long times the dynamics are slowed (over-aging). All findings are in excellent qualitative agreement with recent experiments. The two regimes can be explained by the competing contributions of dynamical heterogeneities and faster aging dynamics at higher temperatures. As a result of this competition, the transition between rejuvenation and over-aging depends on the length of the square step, with shorter steps causing more rejuvenation and longer steps causing more over-aging. Although the spectrum of relaxation times is greatly modified by a temperature step, the van Hove functions, which measure the distribution of particle displacements, exhibit complete superposition at times when the mean-squared displacements are equal. 
0808.01870	Equilibrium order parameters of liquid crystals in the Landau-De Gennes theory	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Apala Majumdar	Abstract:  We study nematic liquid crystal configurations in confined geometries within the continuum Landau--De Gennes theory. These nematic configurations are mathematically described by symmetric, traceless two-tensor fields, known as $\Qvec$-tensor order parameter fields. We obtain explicit upper bounds for the order parameters of equilibrium liquid crystal configurations in terms of the temperature, material constants, boundary conditions and the domain geometry. These bounds are compared with the bounds predicted by the statistical mechanics definition of the $\Qvec$-tensor order parameter. They give quantitative information about the temperature regimes for which the Landau-De Gennes definition and the statistical mechanics definition of the $\Qvec$-tensor order parameter agree and the temperature regimes for which the two definitions fail to agree. For the temperature regimes where the two definitions do not agree, we discuss possible alternatives. 
0808.01871	Using radioactivities to improve the search for nearby radio-quiet neutron stars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Markus M. Hohle, Ralph Neuhaeuser, Nina Tetzlaff	Abstract:  Neutron stars (NS) and black holes (BH) are sources of gravitational waves (GW) and the investigation of young isolated radio-quiet NS can in principle lead to constraints of the equation of state (EoS). The GW signal of merging NSs critically depends on the EoS. However, unlike radio pulsars young isolated radio-quiet neutron stars are hard to detect and only seven of them are known so far. Furthermore, for GW projects it is necessary to confine regions in the sky where and of which quantity sources of GW can be expected. We suggest strategies for the search for young isolated radio-quiet NSs. One of the strategies is to look for radioactivities which are formed during a supernova (SN) event and are detectable due to their decay. Radioactivities with half lives of ~1 Myr can indicate such an event while other remnants like nebulae only remain observable for a few kyrs. Here we give a brief overview of our strategies and discuss advantages and disadvantages 
0808.01872	Chemical evolution of the Magellanic Clouds based on planetary nebulae	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:W. J. Maciel, R. D. D. Costa, T. E. P. Idiart	Abstract:  Planetary nebulae (PN) are an essential tool in the study of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way and galaxies of the Local Group, particularly the Magellanic Clouds. In this work, we present some recent results on the determination of chemical abundances from PN in the Large and Small Magellanic clouds, and compare these results with data from our own Galaxy and other galaxies in the Local Group. As a result of our continuing long term program, we have a large database comprising about 300 objects for which reliable abundances of several elements from He to Ar have been obtained. Such data can be used to derive constraints to the nucleosynthesis processes in the progenitor stars in galaxies of different metallicities. We also investigate the time evolution of the oxygen abundances in the SMC by deriving the properties of the PN progenitor stars, which include their masses and ages. We have then obtained an age-metallicity relation taking into account both oxygen and [Fe/H] abundances. We show that these results have an important consequence on the star formation rate of the SMC, in particular by suggesting a star formation burst in the last 2-3 Gyr. 
0808.01873	Lower Bounds for Dimensions of Sums of Sets	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Daniel M. Oberlin	Abstract:  We study lower bounds for the Minkowski and Hausdorff dimensions of the algebraic sum E+K of two subsets E and K of d-dimensional Euclidean space. 
0808.01874	Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov Theory of Polarized Fermi Systems	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:George Bertsch, Jacek Dobaczewski, Witold Nazarewicz, Junchen Pei	Abstract:  Condensed Fermi systems with an odd number of particles can be described by means of polarizing external fields having a time-odd character. We illustrate how this works for Fermi gases and atomic nuclei treated by density functional theory or Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory. We discuss the method based on introducing two chemical potentials for different superfluid components, whereby one may change the particle-number parity of the underlying quasiparticle vacuum. Formally, this method is a variant of non-collective cranking, and the procedure is equivalent to the so-called blocking. We present and exemplify relations between the two-chemical-potential method and the cranking approximation for Fermi gases and nuclei. 
0808.01875	On the application of the variational iteration method to a prey and predator model with variable coefficients	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Francisco M. Fernandez	Abstract:  We discuss an amazing prey--predator model with variable coefficients, analyze its predictions and the accuracy of the variational iteration method used to solve the nonlinear equations. 
0808.01876	Homogeneous fractional embeddings	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Pierre Inizan (IMCCE)    	Abstract:  Fractional equations appear in the description of the dynamics of various physical systems. For Lagrangian systems, the embedding theory developped by Cresson ["Fractional embedding of differential operators and Lagrangian systems", J. Math. Phys. 48, 033504 (2007)] provides a univocal way to obtain such equations, stemming from a least action principle. However, no matter how equations are obtained, the dimension of the fractional derivative differs from the classical one and may induce problems of temporal homogeneity in fractional objects. In this paper, we show that it is necessary to introduce an extrinsic constant of time. Then, we use it to construct two equivalent fractional embeddings which retain homogeneity. The notion of fractional constant is also discussed through this formalism. Finally, an illustration is given with natural Lagrangian systems, and the case of the harmonic oscillator is entirely treated. 
0808.01877	Pulsed extraction of ionization from helium buffer gas	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:D.J. Morrissey, G. Bollen, M. Facina, S. Schwarz	Abstract:  The migration of intense ionization created in helium buffer gas under the influence of applied electric fields is considered. First the chemical evolution of the ionization created by fast heavy-ion beams is described. Straight forward estimates of the lifetimes for charge exchange indicate a clear suppression of charge exchange during ion migration in low pressure helium. Then self-consistent calculations of the migration of the ions in the electric field of a gas-filled cell at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) using a Particle-In-Cell computer code are presented. The results of the calculations are compared to measurements of the extracted ion current caused by beam pulses injected into the NSCL gas cell. 
0808.01878	The NuMoon experiment: first results	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Buitink, J. Bacelar, R. Braun, G. de Bruyn, H. Falcke, O. Scholten, K. Singh, B. Stappers, R. Strom, R. al Yahyaoui	Abstract:  The NuMoon project uses the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope to search for short radio pulses from the Moon. These pulses are created when an ultra high energy cosmic ray or neutrino initiates a particle cascade inside the Moon's regolith. The cascade has a negative charge excess and moves faster than the local speed of light, which causes coherent Cherenkov radiation to be emitted. With 100 hours of data, a limit on the neutrino flux can be set that is an order of magnitude better than the current one (based on FORTE). We present an analysis of the first 10 hours of data. 
0808.01879	Recent Spin Results from the PHENIX Detector at RHIC	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:Astrid Morreale	Abstract:  The PHENIX Experiment on the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) with its use of beams of polarized protons, provides a unique environment of hard scattering between gluons and quarks complementary to that provided by deep inelastic scattering (DIS). Polarized proton proton collisions can directly probe the polarized gluon and anti-quark distributions as the collisions couple the color charges of the participants. We will give a brief overview of the PHENIX Spin Program and we will report recent results of the many probes accessible to the PHENIX experiment. 
0808.01880	Phantom Dark Energy Models with a Nearly Flat Potential	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Robert J. Scherrer, A.A. Sen	Abstract:  We examine phantom dark energy models produced by a field with a negative kinetic term and a potential that satisfies the slow roll conditions: [(1/V)(dV/dphi)]^2 << 1 and (1/V)(d^2 V/dphi^2) << 1. Such models provide a natural mechanism to produce an equation of state parameter, w, slightly less than -1 at present. Using techniques previously applied to quintessence, we show that in this limit, all such phantom models converge to a single expression for w(a), which is a function only of the present-day values of Omega_phi and w. This expression is identical to the corresponding behavior of w(a) for quintessence models in the same limit. At redshifts z < 1, this limiting behavior is well fit by the linear parametrization, w=w_0 + w_a(1-a), with w_a \approx -1.5(1+w_0). 
0808.01881	B-Pol: Detecting Primordial Gravitational Waves Generated During Inflation	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Paolo de Bernardis, Martin Bucher, Carlo Burigana, Lucio Piccirillo, for the B-Pol Collaboration	Abstract:  B-Pol is a medium-class space mission aimed at detecting the primordial gravitational waves generated during inflation through high accuracy measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization. We discuss the scientific background, feasibility of the experiment, and implementation developed in response to the ESA Cosmic Vision 2015-2025 Call for Proposals. 
0808.01882	Axions and Anomaly-Mediated Interactions: The Green-Schwarz and Wess-Zumino Vertices at Higher Orders and g-2 of the muon	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Roberta Armillis, Claudio Coriano', Marco Guzzi, Simone Morelli	Abstract:  We present a study of the mechanism of anomaly cancellation using only transverse invariant amplitudes on anomaly diagrams at higher perturbative orders. The method is the realization of the Green-Schwarz (GS) mechanism at field theory level, which restores the Ward identities by a subtraction of the anomaly pole. Some of the properties of the GS vertex are analyzed both in the context of unitarity and of the organization of the related perturbative expansion. We investigate the role played by the GS and the Wess-Zumino vertices in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and in the hyperfine splitting of muonium, which are processes that can be accompanied by the exchange of a virtual anomalous extra Z-prime and an axion-like particle. 
0808.01883	High-order low-storage explicit Runge-Kutta schemes for equations with quadratic nonlinearities	Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)	Authors:Marc E. Brachet, Pablo D. Mininni, Duane L. Rosenberg, Annick Pouquet	Abstract:  We show in this paper that third- and fourth-order low storage Runge-Kutta algorithms can be built specifically for quadratic nonlinear operators, at the expense of roughly doubling the time needed for evaluating the temporal derivatives. The resulting algorithms are especially well suited for computational fluid dynamics. Examples are given for the Hénon-Heiles Hamiltonian system and, in one and two space dimensions, for the Burgers equation using both a pseudo-spectral code and a spectral element code, respectively. The scheme is also shown to be practical in three space solving the incompressible Euler equation using a fully parallelized pseudo-spectral code. 
0808.01884	Squishing dimers on the hexagon lattice	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Benjamin Young	Abstract:  We describe an operation on dimer configurations on the hexagon lattice, called "squishing", and use this operation to explain some of the properties of dimer generating functions. 
0808.01885	Generating mixtures of spatial qubits	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:G. Lima, F.A. Torres-Ruiz, L. Neves, A. Delgado, C. Saavedra, S. Padua	Abstract:  In a recent letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 100501 (2005)], we presented a scheme for generating pure entangled states of spatial qudits ($D$-dimensional quantum systems) by using the momentum transverse correlation of the parametric down-converted photons. In this work we discuss a generalization of this process to enable the creation of mixed states. With the technique proposed we experimentally generated a mixture of two spatial qubits. 
0808.01886	The generalised scaling function: a systematic study	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Davide Fioravanti, Paolo Grinza, Marco Rossi	Abstract:  We describe a procedure for determining the generalised scaling functions $f_n(g)$ at all the values of the coupling constant. These functions describe the high spin contribution to the anomalous dimension of large twist operators (in the $sl(2)$ sector) of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM. At fixed $n$, $f_n(g)$ can be obtained by solving a linear integral equation (or, equivalently, a linear system with an infinite number of equations), whose inhomogeneous term only depends on the solutions at smaller $n$. In other words, the solution can be written in a recursive form and then explicitly worked out in the strong coupling regime. In this regime, we also emphasise the peculiar convergence of different quantities ('masses', related to the $f_n(g)$) to the unique mass gap of the $O(6)$ nonlinear sigma model and analyse the first next-to-leading order corrections. 
0808.01887	Using Warrants As a Window to Epistemic Framing	Physics Education (physics.ed-ph)	Authors:Thomas J. Bing, Edward F. Redish	Abstract:  Mathematics can serve many functions in physics. It can provide a computational system, reflect a physical idea, conveniently encode a rule, and so forth. A physics student thus has many different options for using mathematics in his physics problem solving. We present a short example from the problem solving work of upper level physics students and use it to illustrate the epistemic framing process: framing because these students are focusing on a subset of their total math knowledge, epistemic because their choice of subset relates to what they see (at that particular time) as the nature of the math knowledge in play. We illustrate how looking for the warrants students use, the often unspoken reasons they think their evidence supports their mathematical claims, serves as a window to their epistemic framing. These warrants provide a powerful, concise piece of evidence of their epistemic framing. 
0808.01888	Weighted interlace polynomials	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Lorenzo Traldi	Abstract:  The interlace polynomials introduced by Arratia, Bollobas and Sorkin extend to invariants of graphs with vertex weights, and these weighted interlace polynomials have several novel properties. One novel property is a version of the fundamental three-term formula q(G)=q(G-a)+q(G^{ab}-b)+((x-1)^{2}-1)q(G^{ab}-a-b) that lacks the last term. It follows that interlace polynomial computations can be represented by binary trees rather than mixed binary-ternary trees. Binary computation trees provide a description of $q(G)$ that is analogous to the activities description of the Tutte polynomial. If $G$ is a tree or forest then these "algorithmic activities" are associated with a certain kind of independent set in $G$. Three other novel properties are weighted pendant-twin reductions, which involve removing certain kinds of vertices from a graph and adjusting the weights of the remaining vertices in such a way that the interlace polynomials are unchanged. These reductions allow for smaller computation trees as they eliminate some branches. If a graph can be completely analyzed using pendant-twin reductions then its interlace polynomial can be calculated in polynomial time. An intuitively pleasing property is that graphs which can be constructed through graph substitutions have vertex-weighted interlace polynomials which can be obtained through algebraic substitutions. 
0808.01889	On The Origin of the Blue Tilt in Extragalactic Globular Cluster Systems	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jay Strader (CfA), Graeme Smith (UCO/Lick)    	Abstract:  Some early-type galaxies show a correlation between color and integrated magnitude among the brighter metal-poor globular clusters (GCs). This phenomenon, known as the blue tilt, implies a mass-metallicity relationship among these clusters. In this paper we show that self-enrichment in GCs can explain several aspects of the blue tilt, and discuss predictions of this scenario. 
0808.01890	Constraining Orbital Parameters Through Planetary Transit Monitoring	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Stephen R. Kane, Kaspar von Braun	Abstract:  The orbital parameters of extra-solar planets have a significant impact on the probability that the planet will transit the host star. This was recently demonstrated by the transit detection of HD 17156b whose favourable eccentricity and argument of periastron dramatically increased its transit likelihood. We present a study which provides a quantitative analysis of how these two orbital parameters affect the geometric transit probability as a function of period. Further, we apply these results to known radial velocity planets and show that there are unexpectedly high transit probabilities for planets at relatively long periods. For a photometric monitoring campaign which aims to determine if the planet indeed transits, we calculate the expected transiting planet yield and the significance of a potential null result, as well as the subsequent constraints that may be applied to orbital parameters. 
0808.01891	The Aharonov-Bohm effect for a knotted magnetic solenoid	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Roman V. Buniy, Thomas W. Kephart	Abstract:  We show that the linking of a semiclassical path of a charged particle with a knotted magnetic solenoid results in the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The phase shift in the wave function is proportional to the flux intersecting a certain connected and orientable surface bounded by the knot (a Seifert surface of the knot). 
0808.01892	Higher order Josephson effects	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Roman V. Buniy, Thomas W. Kephart	Abstract:  Gaussian linking of superconducting loops containing Josephson junctions with enclosed magnetic fields give rise to interference shifts in the phase that modulates the current carried through the loop, proportional to the magnitude of the enclosed flux. We generalize these results to higher order linking of a superconducting loop with several magnetic solenoids, and show there may be interference shifts proportional to the product of two or more fluxes. 
0808.01893	Mid-infrared spectra of optically selected type 2 quasars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Nadia L. Zakamska (1,2), Laura Gomez (3,4), Michael A. Strauss (5), Julian H. Krolik (6) ((1) IAS, (2) Spitzer Fellow, (3) MPI Radioastronomie, (4) UNAM, (5) Princeton, (6) JHU)    	Abstract:  Type 2 quasars are luminous Active Galactic Nuclei whose central engines are seen through large amounts of gas and dust. We present Spitzer spectra of twelve type 2 quasars selected on the basis of their optical emission line properties. Within this sample, we find a surprising diversity of spectra, from those that are featureless to those showing strong PAH emission, deep silicate absorption at 10 micron, hydrocarbon absorption, high-ionization emission lines and H_2 rotational emission lines. About half of the objects in the sample are likely Compton-thick, including the two with the deepest Si absorption. The median star-formation luminosity of the objects in our sample measured from the strength of the PAH features is 5x10^11 L_sun, much higher than for field galaxies or for any other AGN sample, but similar to other samples of type 2 quasars. This suggests an evolutionary link between obscured quasars and peak star formation activity in the host galaxy. Despite the high level of star formation, the bolometric output is dominated by the quasar in all cases. For a given strength of 10 micron Si absorption, ULIRGs are significantly colder than are type 2 quasars (their F_nu[14.5 micron]/F_nu[27.5 micron] ratio is 0.5 dex lower), perhaps reflecting different obscuration geometries in these sources. We find that the appearance of the 10 micron feature (i.e., whether it shows in emission or in absorption) is well-correlated with the optical classification in type 1 and type 2 quasars, contrary to some models of clumpy obscuration. Furthermore, this correlation is significantly stronger in quasars (L_bol>10^45 erg/s) than it is in Seyfert galaxies (L_bol<<10^45 erg/s). 
0808.01894	Higgsonium in singlet extension of Standard Model	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Vladimir Sauli	Abstract:  A possible formation of bound state is predicted in the Standard Model extension with with additional scalar singlet. A suitable method of solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation for a Higgsonium bound state is proposed. With the help of an integral representation the results are directly obtained in Minkowski space. The appearance of Higgsonia is shown to be quite natural for considered extension of Standard model and the calculations are presented for the bound state composed from two scalars which result from the large mixture of electroweak doublet and singlet eigenstate.

Wyslouch	Abstract:  The centrality dependence of the midrapidity charged-particle multiplicity density ($|η|$$<$1) is presented for Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at RHIC over a broad range of collision energies. The multiplicity measured in the Cu+Cu system is found to be similar to that measured in the Au+Au system, for an equivalent N$_{\rm part}$, with the observed factorization in energy and centrality still persistent in the smaller Cu+Cu system. The extent of the similarities observed for bulk particle production is tested by a comparative analysis of the inclusive transverse momentum distributions for Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions near midrapidity. It is found that, within the uncertainties of the data, the ratio of yields between the various energies for both Au+Au and Cu+Cu systems are similar and constant with centrality, both in the bulk yields as well as a function of p$_{\rm T}$, up to at least 4 GeV/$c$. The effects of multiple nucleon collisions that strongly increase with centrality and energy appear to only play a minor role in bulk and intermediate transverse momentum particle production. 
0808.01896	Equilibrium and nonequilibrium thermodynamics of particle-stabilized thin liquid films	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:J. Blawzdziewicz, E. Wajnryb	Abstract:  Our recent quasi-two-dimensional thermodynamic description of thin-liquid films stabilized by colloidal particles is generalized to describe nonuniform equilibrium states of films in external potentials and nonequilibrium transport processes produced in the film by gradients of thermodynamic forces. Using a Monte--Carlo simulation method, we have determined equilibrium equations of state for a film stabilized by a suspension of hard spheres. Employing a multipolar-expansion method combined with a flow-reflection technique, we have also evaluated the short-time film-viscosity coefficients and collective particle mobility. 
0808.01897	Superconducting atom chips: advantages and challenges	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Valery Dikovsky, Vladimir Sokolovsky, Bo Zhang, Carsten Henkel, Ron Folman	Abstract:  Superconductors are considered in view of applications to atom chip devices. The main features of magnetic traps based on superconducting wires in the Meissner and mixed states are discussed. The former state may mainly be interesting for improved atom optics, while in the latter, cold atoms may provide a probe of superconductor phenomena. The properties of a magnetic side guide based on a single superconducting strip wire placed in an external magnetic field are calculated analytically and numerically. In the mixed state of type II superconductors, inhomogeneous trapped magnetic flux, relaxation processes and noise caused by vortex motion are posing specific challenges for atom trapping. 
0808.01898	Phonon-induced artificial magnetic fields	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Alexander Klein, Dieter Jaksch	Abstract:  We investigate the effect of a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate on a system of immersed impurity atoms trapped by an optical lattice. We analytically show that for a one-dimensional, ring-shaped setup the coupling of the impurities to the Bogoliubov phonons of the condensate leads to a non-trivial phase in the impurity hopping. The presence of this phase can be tested by observing a drift in the transport properties of the impurities. These results are quantitatively confirmed by a numerically exact simulation of a two-mode Bose-Hubbard model. We also give analytical expressions for the occurring phase terms for a two-dimensional setup. The phase realises an artificial magnetic field and can for instance be used for the simulation of the quantum Hall effect using atoms in an optical lattice. 
0808.01899	A Bursting Radio Transient in the Direction of the Galactic Center	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Paul S. Ray, Scott D. Hyman, T. Joseph Lazio, Namir E. Kassim, Subhashis Roy, David L. Kaplan, Deepto Chakrabarty	Abstract:  The radio sky is poorly sampled for rapidly varying transients because of the narrow field-of-view of most imaging radio telescopes at cm and shorter wavelengths. The emergence of sensitive long wavelength observations with intrinsically larger fields-of-view are changing this situation, as partly illustrated by our ongoing meter-wavelength monitoring observations and archival studies of the Galactic Center. In this search, we discovered a transient, bursting, radio source in the direction of the Galactic Center, GCRT J1745-3009, with extremely unusual properties. Its flux and rapid variability imply a brightness temperature >10^12 K if it is at a distance >70 pc, implying that it is a coherent emitter. I will discuss the discovery of the source and the subsequent re-detections, as well as searches for counterparts at other wavelengths, and several proposed models. 
0808.01900	Fermions with attractive interactions on optical lattices and implications for correlated systems	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Chih-Chun Chien, Qijin Chen, K. Levin	Abstract:  In this paper we address the behavior of the superfluid transition temperature $T_c$ in the attractive Hubbard model. We study systematically the effects of pairing fluctuations and address all filling fractions over the entire range of attractive interaction strength. While the attractive Hubbard model can be regarded as the generalization of BCS to Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover to a lattice, we find that the BEC limit of this Hubbard model is very different from that of jellium, owing to the strong inter-site repulsion between pairs, which becomes important near half filling when the on-site attraction is strong. A central conclusion of our work is that in a lattice, around half filling, the smooth evolution from the BCS to the BEC limits is interrupted. For the attractive Hubbard model, $T_c$ vanishes when the system approaches the bosonic regime with increasing interaction strength. We suggest that the vanishing of $T_c$ at strong coupling strength may signal a quantum critical transition to another form of superfluid not continuously connected to a BCS-like phase. We present a simple variational ansatz for the ground state in this more strongly coupled superfluid. We further generalize the (s-wave) Hubbard model to d-wave pairing and address issues of potential relevance to high temperature superconductors. For the d-wave case, we present a phase diagram and show that here too, one observes a vanishing of $T_c$ when the pairing onset temperature $T^*$ becomes sufficiently large. We suggest that future experiments on ultracold fermions in optical lattices should not be exclusively limited to the repulsive Hubbard model, but should address the attractive model in order to elucidate features of high temperature superconductivity. 
0808.01901	Measurements of the Casimir-Lifshitz force in fluids: the effect of electrostatic forces and Debye screening	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:J. N. Munday, Federico Capasso, V. Adrian Parsegian, Sergey M. Bezrukov	Abstract:  In this work, we present detailed measurements of the Casimir-Lifshitz force between two gold surfaces (a sphere and a plate) immersed in ethanol and study the effect of residual electrostatic forces, which are dominated by static fields within the apparatus and can be reduced with proper shielding. Electrostatic forces are further reduced by Debye screening through the addition of salt ions to the liquid. Additionally, the salt leads to a reduction of the Casimir-Lifshitz force by screening the zero-frequency contribution to the force; however, the effect is small between gold surfaces at the measured separations and within experimental error. An improved calibration procedure is described and compared to previous methods. Finally, the experimental results are compared to Lifshitz's theory and found to be consistent for the materials used in the experiment. 
0808.01902	The Atmospheric Signatures of Super-Earths: How to Distinguish Between Hydrogen-Rich and Hydrogen-Poor Atmospheres	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:E. Miller-Ricci, D. Sasselov, S. Seager	Abstract:  Extrasolar super-Earths (1-10 M$_{\earth}$) are likely to exist with a wide range of atmospheres. Some super-Earths may be able to retain massive hydrogen-rich atmospheres. Others might never accumulate hydrogen or experience significant escape of lightweight elements, resulting in atmospheres more like those of the terrestrial planets in our Solar System. We examine how an observer could differentiate between hydrogen-rich and hydrogen-poor atmospheres by modeling super-Earth emission and transmission spectra, and we find that discrimination is possible by observing the transmission spectrum alone. An Earth-like atmosphere, composed of mostly heavy elements and molecules, will have a very weak transmission signal due to its small atmospheric scale height (since the scale height is inversely proportional to molecular weight). On the other hand, a large hydrogen-rich atmosphere reveals a relatively large transmission signal. The super Earth emission spectrum can additionally contrain the atmospheric composition and temperature structure. Super-Earths with massive hydrogen atmospheres will reveal strong spectral features due to water, whereas those that have lost most of their hydrogen (and have no liquid ocean) will be marked by CO$_2$ features and a lack of H$_2$O. We apply our study specifically to the low-mass planet orbiting an M star, Gl 581c ($M sin i$ = 5 M$_{\earth}$), although our conclusions are relevant for super-Earths in general. The ability to distinguish hydrogen-rich atmospheres might be essential for interpreting mass and radius observations of planets in the transition between rocky super-Earths and Neptune-like planets. 
0808.01903	Update of Time-Dependent CP Asymmetry Measurements in $b$-->$c\bar{c}s$ Decays	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We present updated measurements of time-dependent CP asymmetries in fully reconstructed neutral B decays containing a charmonium meson. The measurements reported here use a data sample of $(465\pm 5)\times 10^6$ $Υ(4S) \to B \bar{B}$ decays collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II $B$ factory. The time-dependent CP asymmetry parameters measured from $J/ψK_S^0$, $J/ψK_L^0$, $ψ(2S) K_S^0$, $χ_{c1} K_S^0$, $η_c K_S^0$, and $J/ψK^{*0}$ decays are \begin{eqnarray} C_f &=& 0.026 \pm 0.020(stat) \pm 0.016(syst), S_f &=& 0.691 \pm 0.029(stat) \pm 0.014(syst). \end{eqnarray} 
0808.01904	A Model With Dynamical R-parity Breaking and Unstable Gravitino Dark Matter	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Xiangdong Ji (1 and 2), Rabindra N. Mohapatra (1), Shmuel Nussinov (3), Yue Zhang (2 and 1) ((1) University of Maryland, (2) Peking University, (3) Tel Aviv University)    	Abstract:  An unstable gravitino with lifetime longer than $10^{26}$ sec or so has been proposed as a possible dark matter candidate in supergravity models with R-parity breaking. We find a natural realization of this idea in the minimal supersymmetric left-right models where left-right symmetry breaking scale in the few TeV range. It is known that in these models, R-parity must break in order to have parity breaking as required by low energy weak interactions. The sub-eV neutrino masses imply that R-parity breaking effects in this model must be highly suppressed. This in turn makes the gravitino LSP long lived enough, so that it becomes the dark matter of the Universe. It also allows detectable displaced vertices at the LHC from NLSP decays. We present a detailed analysis of the model and some aspects of its rich phenomenology. 
0808.01905	Ways towards pure deuterium inertial confinement fusion through the attainment of gigavolt potentials	Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)	Authors:Friedwardt Winterberg	Abstract:  The attainment of ultrahigh electric potentials by suppressing the stepped leader breakdown of a highly charged conductor levitated in a spiraling Taylor flow opens up the possibility of order of magnitude larger driver energies for the ignition of thermonuclear reactions by inertial confinement. In reaching gigavolt potentials, intense 1016 Watt, GeV ion beams become possible. Together with their large self-magnetic field, these beams should be powerful enough to launch a thermonuclear micro-detonation into pure deuterium, compressed and ignited by such beams. In high gain laser fusion the proton flash from the micro-explosion is likely to destroy the optical laser ignition apparatus, and it is not explained how to avoid this danger. The possible attainment of gigavolt potentials could make laser fusion obsolete. 
0808.01906	Z' Physics at the LHC and the LHeC	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Thomas G Rizzo	Abstract:  The methods which can be employed to determine the properties of new neutral resonant states that may be observed in the Drell-Yan channel at the LHC are reviewed. If these states are sufficiently light we discuss how polarized $ep$ scattering at the LHeC can assist in the determination of their couplings to the Standard Model (SM) fermions. 
0808.01907	Turbulence, representations, and trace-preserving actions	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:David Kerr, Hanfeng Li, Mikael Pichot	Abstract:  We establish criteria for turbulence in certain spaces of C*-algebra representations and apply this to the problem of nonclassifiability by countable structures for group actions on a standard atomless probability space (X,μ) and on the hyperfinite II_1 factor R. We also prove that the conjugacy action on the space of free actions of a countably infinite amenable group on R is turbulent, and that the conjugacy action on the space of ergodic measure-preserving flows on (X,μ) is generically turbulent. 
0808.01908	Coreless Terrestrial Exoplanets	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:L. Elkins-Tanton, S. Seager (MIT)    	Abstract:  Differentiation in terrestrial planets is expected to include the formation of a metallic iron core. We predict the existence of terrestrial planets that have differentiated but have no metallic core--planets that are effectively a giant silicate mantle. We discuss two paths to forming a coreless terrestrial planet, whereby the oxidation state during planetary accretion and solidification will determine the size or existence of any metallic core. Under this hypothesis, any metallic iron in the bulk accreting material is oxidized by water, binding the iron in the form of iron oxide into the silicate minerals of the planetary mantle. The existence of such silicate planets has consequences for interpreting the compositions and interior density structures of exoplanets based on their mass and radius measurements. 
0808.01909	Ranges of Atmospheric Mass and Composition of Super Earth Exoplanets	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:L. Elkins-Tanton, S. Seager (MIT)    	Abstract:  Terrestrial-like exoplanets may obtain atmospheres from three primary sources: Capture of nebular gases, degassing during accretion, and degassing from subsequent tectonic activity. Here we model degassing during accretion to estimate the range of atmospheric mass and composition on exoplanets ranging from 1 to 30 Earth masses. We use bulk compositions drawn from primitive and differentiated meteorite compositions. Degassing alone can create a wide range of masses of planetary atmospheres, ranging from less than a percent of the planet's total mass up to ~6 mass% of hydrogen, ~20 mass% of water, and/or ~5 mass% of carbon compounds. Hydrogen-rich atmospheres can be outgassed as a result of oxidizing metallic iron with water, and excess water and carbon can produce atmospheres through simple degassing. As a byproduct of our atmospheric outgassing models we find that modest initial water contents (10 mass% of the planet and above) create planets with deep surface liquid water oceans soon after accretion is complete. 
0808.01910	Averaging and large deviation principles for fully-coupled piecewise deterministic Markov processes and applications to molecular motors	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:A. Faggionato, D. Gabrielli, M. Ribezzi Crivellari	Abstract:  We consider Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs) with a finite set of discrete states. In the regime of fast jumps between discrete states, we prove a law of large number and a large deviation principle. In the regime of fast and slow jumps, we analyze a coarse-grained process associated to the original one and prove its convergence to a new PDMP with effective force fields and jump rates. In all the above cases, the continuous variables evolve slowly according to ODEs. Finally, we discuss some applications related to the mechanochemical cycle of macromolecules, including strained--dependent power--stroke molecular motors. Our analysis covers the case of fully--coupled slow and fast motions. 
0808.01911	Semi-classical central charge in topologically massive gravity	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Geoffrey Compère, Stéphane Detournay	Abstract:  It is shown that the warped black holes geometries discussed recently in 0807.3040 admit an algebra of asymptotic symmetries isomorphic to the semi-direct product of a Virasoro algebra and an algebra of currents. The realization of this asymptotic symmetry by canonical charges allows one to find the central charge of the Virasoro algebra. The right-moving central charge $c_R = \frac{(5\hatν^2+3)l}{G\hatν (\hatν^2+3)}$ is obtained when the Virasoro generators are normalized in order to have a positive zero mode spectrum for the warped black holes. The current algebra is also shown to be centrally-extended. 
0808.01912	Supersymmetric Gödel and warped black holes in string theory	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Geoffrey Compère, Stéphane Detournay, Mauricio Romo	Abstract:  It is observed that three-dimensional Gödel black holes can be promoted to exact string theory backgrounds through an orbifold of an hyperbolic asymmetric marginal deformation of the SL(2,R) WZW model. Tachyons are found in the spectrum of long strings. Uplifting these solutions in type IIB supergravity, extremal black holes are shown to preserve one supersymmetry in accordance with the BTZ limit. We also make connections with some recently discussed warped black hole solutions of topologically massive gravity, showing that they actually correspond to quotients of spacelike squashed AdS_3. 
0808.01913	Transiting Exoplanets with JWST	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Seager (MIT), D. Deming (NASA/GSFC), J. A. Valenti (STScI)    	Abstract:  The era of exoplanet characterization is upon us. For a subset of exoplanets -- the transiting planets -- physical properties can be measured, including mass, radius, and atmosphere characteristics. Indeed, measuring the atmospheres of a further subset of transiting planets, the hot Jupiters, is now routine with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will continue Spitzer's legacy with its large mirror size and precise thermal stability. JWST is poised for the significant achievement of identifying habitable planets around bright M through G stars--rocky planets lacking extensive gas envelopes, with water vapor and signs of chemical disequilibrium in their atmospheres. Favorable transiting planet systems, are, however, anticipated to be rare and their atmosphere observations will require tens to hundreds of hours of JWST time per planet. We review what is known about the physical characteristics of transiting planets, summarize lessons learned from Spitzer high-contrast exoplanet measurements, and give several examples of potential JWST observations. 
0808.01914	Unusually strong space-charge-limited current in thin wires	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:A. Alec Talin, François Léonard, B. S. Swartzentruber, Xin Wang, Stephen D. Hersee	Abstract:  The current-voltage characteristics of thin wires are often observed to be nonlinear, and this behavior has been ascribed to Schottky barriers at the contacts. We present electronic transport measurements on GaN nanorods and demonstrate that the nonlinear behavior originates instead from space-charge-limited current. A theory of space-charge-limited current in thin wires corroborates the experiments, and shows that poor screening in high aspect ratio materials leads to a dramatic enhancement of space-charge limited current, resulting in new scaling in terms of the aspect ratio. 
0808.01915	Measurement of Branching Fractions and CP and Isospin Asymmetries in B -> K* gamma	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We present a preliminary analysis of the decays B0 -> K*0 gamma and B+ -> K*+ gamma using a sample of 383 x 10^6 BBbar events collected with the BABAR dector at the PEP-II asymmetric energy B factory. We measure the branching fractions BF(B0 -> K*0 Gamma) = (4.58 +/- 0.11 +/- 0.16) x 10^-5 and BF(B+ -> K*+ Gamma) = 4.73 +/- 0.15 +/- 0.17 x 10^-5. We measure the direct CP asymmetry to be -0.043 < A(B -> K* gamma) < 0.025 and the isospin asymmetry to be -0.021 < Delta0- < 0.079, where the limits are determined at the 90% confidence interval and include both the statistical and systematic uncertainties. 
0808.01916	A Computational Tool to Interpret the Bulk Composition of Solid Exoplanets based on Mass and Radius Measurements	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Li Zeng, Sara Seager (MIT)    	Abstract:  The prospects for finding transiting exoplanets in the range of a few to 20 Earth masses is growing rapidly with both ground-based and spaced-based efforts. We describe a publicly available computer code to compute and quantify the compositional ambiguities for differentiated solid exoplanets with a measured mass and radius, including the mass and radius uncertainties. 
0808.01917	Isoscaling in statistical fragment emission in an extended compound nucleus model	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:W. Ye, J. Tõke, W. U. Schröder	Abstract:  Based on an extended compound nucleus model, isospin effects in statistical fragment emission from excited nuclear systems are investigated. An experimentally observed scaling behavior of the ratio of isotope yields $Y_i(N,Z)$ from two similar emitting sources with different neutron-to-proton ratios is predicted theoretically, i.e., the relationship of $Y_2/Y_1 \propto exp(αN + βZ)$ is demonstrated. The symmetry energy coefficient $C_{sym}$ extracted from the simulation results is $\sim$ 27 MeV which is consistent with realistic theoretical estimates and recent experimental data. The influence of the surface entropy on the isoscaling behavior is discussed in detail. It is found that although the surface entropy increases the numercial values of isoscaling parameters $α$ and $β$, it does not affect the isoscaling behavior qualitatively and has only a minor effect on the extracted symmetry energy coefficient. 
0808.01918	The Stellar Populations of M33's Outer Regions IV: Inflow History and Chemical Evolution	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Michael K. Barker (Institute for Astronomy, Edinburgh), Ata Sarajedini (Univ. of Florida)    	Abstract:  We have modelled the observed color-magnitude diagram (CMD) at one location in M33's outskirts under the framework of a simple chemical evolution scenario which adopts instantaneous and delayed recycling for the nucleosynthetic products of Type II and Ia supernovae. In this scenario, interstellar gas forms stars at a rate modulated by the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation and gas outflow occurs at a rate proportional to the star formation rate (SFR). With this approach, we put broad constraints on the role of gas flows during this region's evolution and compare its [alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation with that of other Local Group systems. We find that models with gas inflow are significantly better than the closed box model at reproducing the observed distribution of stars in the CMD. The best models have a majority of gas inflow taking place in the last 7 Gyr, and relatively little in the last 3 Gyr. These models predict most stars in this region to have [alpha/Fe] ratios lower than the bulk of the Milky Way's halo. The predictions for the present-day SFR, gas mass, and oxygen abundance compare favorably to independent empirical estimates. Our results paint a picture in which M33's outer disc formed from the protracted inflow of gas over several Gyr with at least half of the total inflow occurring since z ~ 1. 
0808.01919	Entropy Bound and Causality Violation in Higher Curvature Gravity	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Ishwaree P. Neupane, Naresh Dadhich	Abstract:  In any quantum theory of gravity we do expect corrections to Einstein gravity to occur. Yet, at fundamental level, it is not apparent what the most relevant corrections are. We argue that the generic curvature square corrections present in lower dimensional actions of various compactified string theories provide a natural passage between the classical and quantum realms of gravity. The Gauss-Bonnet and $({\rm Riemann})^2$ gravities, in particular, provide concrete examples in which inconsistency of a theory, such as, a violation of microcausality, and a classical limit on black hole entropy are correlated. In such theories the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density, $η/s$, can be smaller than for a boundary conformal field theory with Einstein gravity dual. This result is interesting from the viewpoint that the nuclear matter or quark-gluon plasma produced (such as at RHIC) under extreme densities and temperatures may violate the conjectured bound $η/s\ge 1/4π$, {\it albeit} marginally so. 
0808.01920	Ground state normalization in the nonmesonic weak decay of $^{12}_ΛC$ hypernucleus within a nuclear matter formalism	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:E. Bauer	Abstract:  The nonmesonic weak decay width of $^{12}_ΛC$ hypernucleus has been evaluated within a nuclear matter formalism, using the local density approximation. In addition to the one-body induced decay $(ΛN \to n N)$, it has been also considered the two-body induced decay $(ΛNN \to n N N)$. This second decay is originated from ground state correlations, where a renormalization procedure to ensure a ground state normalized to one has been implemented. Our results show that the plain addition of the two-body induced decay implies a lost in the ground state-norm, which adds $\sim 38%$ of spurious intensity to the nonmesonic weak decay width. By an adequate selection of the $ΛN$-transition potential, our result for the nonmesonic weak decay width of $^{12}_ΛC$ is 0.956, in good agreement with the most recent data. 
0808.01921	First Cosmological Constraints on Dark Energy from the Radial Baryon Acoustic Scale	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Enrique Gaztanaga, Ramon Miquel, Eusebio Sanchez	Abstract:  We present cosmological constraints arising from the first measurement of the radial (line-of-sight) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) scale in the large scale structure traced by the galaxy distribution. Here we use these radial BAO measurements at z = 0.24 and z = 0.43 to derive new constraints on dark energy and its equation of state for a flat universe, without any other assumptions on the cosmological model: w = -1.14 +/- 0.39 (assumed constant), Omega_m = 0.24+0.06-0.05. If we drop the assumption of flatness and include previous cosmic microwave background and supernova measurements, we find w = -0.974 +/- 0.058, Omega_m = 0.271 +/- 0.015, and Omega_k = -0.002 +/- 0.006, in good agreement with a flat cold dark matter cosmology with a cosmological constant. To our knowledge, these are the most stringent constraints on these parameters to date under our stated assumptions. 
0808.01922	The number of 2x2 integer matrices having a prescribed integer eigenvalue	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Greg Martin, Erick B. Wong	Abstract:  Random matrices arise in many mathematical contexts, and it is natural to ask about the properties that such matrices satisfy. If we choose a matrix with integer entries at random, for example, what is the probability that it will have a particular integer as an eigenvalue, or an integer eigenvalue at all? If we choose a matrix with real entries at random, what is the probability that it will have a real eigenvalue in a particular interval? The purpose of this paper is to resolve these questions, once they are made suitably precise, in the setting of 2x2 matrices. 
0808.01923	Connections on non-abelian Gerbes and their Holonomy	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Urs Schreiber, Konrad Waldorf	Abstract:  We introduce an axiomatic framework for the parallel transport of connections on gerbes. It incorporates parallel transport along curves and along surfaces, and is formulated in terms of gluing axioms and smoothness conditions. The smoothness conditions are imposed with respect to a strict Lie 2-group, which plays the role of a band, or structure 2-group. Upon choosing certain examples of Lie 2-groups, our axiomatic framework reproduces in a systematical way several known concepts of gerbes with connection: non-abelian differential cocycles, Breen-Messing gerbes, abelian and non-abelian bundle gerbes. These relationships convey a well-defined notion of surface holonomy from our axiomatic framework to each of these concrete models. Till now, holonomy was only known for abelian gerbes; our approach reproduces that known concept and extends it to non-abelian gerbes. Several new features of surface holonomy are exposed under its extension to non-abelian gerbes; for example, it carries an action of the mapping class group of the surface. 
0808.01924	Narrowband spectroscopy by all-optical correlation of broadband pulses	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Stanislav O. Konorov, Xiaoji G. Xu, John W. Hepburn, Valery Milner	Abstract:  High peak power ultrafast lasers are widely used in nonlinear spectroscopy but often limit its spectral resolution because of the broad frequency bandwidth of ultrashort laser pulses. Improving the resolution by achieving spectrally narrow excitation of, or emission from, the resonant medium by means of multi-photon interferences has been the focus of many recent developments in ultrafast spectroscopy. We demonstrate an alternative approach, in which high resolution is exercised by detecting narrow spectral correlations between broadband excitation and emission optical fields. All-optical correlation analysis, easily incorporated into the traditional spectroscopic setup, enables direct, robust and simultaneous detection of multiple narrow resonances with a single femtosecond pulse. 
0808.01925	Finite-size effects on a lattice calculation	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Rafael G. Campos, Eduardo S. Tututi	Abstract:  We study in this paper the finite-size effects of a non-periodic lattice on a lattice calculation. To this end we use a finite lattice equipped with a central difference derivative with homogeneous boundary conditions to calculate the bosonic mass associated to the Schwinger model. We found that the homogeneous boundary conditions produce absence of fermion doubling and chiral invariance, but we also found that in the continuum limit this lattice model does not yield the correct value of the boson mass as other models do. We discuss the reasons for this and, as a result, the matrix which cause the fermion doubling problem is identified. 
0808.01926	Maximal Success Probabilities of Linear-Optical Quantum Gates	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Dmitry B. Uskov, Lev Kaplan, A. Matthew Smith, Sean D. Huver, Jonathan P. Dowling	Abstract:  Numerical optimization is used to design linear-optical devices that implement a desired quantum gate with perfect fidelity, while maximizing the success rate. For the 2-qubit CS (or CNOT) gate, we provide numerical evidence that the maximum success rate is $S=2/27$ using two unentangled ancilla resources; interestingly, additional ancilla resources do not increase the success rate. For the 3-qubit Toffoli gate, we show that perfect fidelity is obtained with only three unentangled ancilla photons -- less than in any existing scheme -- with a maximum $S=0.00340$. This compares well with $S=(2/27)^2/2 \approx 0.00274$, obtainable by combining two CNOT gates and a passive quantum filter [PRA 68, 064303 (2003)]. The general optimization approach can easily be applied to other areas of interest, such as quantum error correction, cryptography, and metrology [arXiv:0807.4906, PRL 99 070801 (2007)].

Fender	Abstract:  We discuss the dynamics of microquasar jets in the interstellar medium, with specific focus on the effects of the X-ray binaries' space velocity with respect to the local Galactic standard of rest. We argue that, during late stages in the evolution of large scale radio nebulae around microquasars, the ram pressure of the interstellar medium due to the microquasar's space velocity becomes important and that microquasars with high velocities form the Galactic equivalent of extragalactic head-tail sources, i.e., that they leave behind trails of stripped radio plasma. Because of their higher space velocities, low-mass X-ray binaries are more likely to leave trails than high-mass X-ray binaries. We show that the volume of radio plasma released by microquasars over the history of the Galaxy is comparable to the disk volume and argue that a fraction of a few percent of the radio plasma left behind by the X-ray binary is likely mixed with the neutral phases of the ISM before the plasma is removed from the disk by buoyancy. Because the formation of microquasars is an unavoidable by-product of star formation, and because they can travel far from their birth places, their activity likely has important consequences for the evolution of magnetic fields in forming galaxies. We show that radio emission from the plasma inside the trail should be detectable at low frequencies. We suggest that LMXBs with high detected proper motions like XTE J1118+480 will be the best candidates for such a search. 
0808.01928	Decision Problems For Convex Languages	Computational Complexity (cs.CC)	Authors:Janusz Brzozowski, Jeffrey Shallit, Zhi Xu	Abstract:  In this paper we examine decision problems associated with various classes of convex languages, studied by Ang and Brzozowski (under the name "continuous languages"). We show that we can decide whether a given language L is prefix-, suffix-, factor-, or subword-convex in polynomial time if L is represented by a DFA, but that the problem is PSPACE-hard if L is represented by an NFA. In the case that a regular language is not convex, we prove tight upper bounds on the length of the shortest words demonstrating this fact, in terms of the number of states of an accepting DFA. Similar results are proved for some subclasses of convex languages: the prefix-, suffix-, factor-, and subword-closed languages, and the prefix-, suffix-, factor-, and subword-free languages.

0808.01930	Geometry of density sates	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Luis J. Boya, Kuldeep Dixit	Abstract:  We reconsider the geometry of pure and mixed states in a finite quantum system. The rangesof eigenvalues of the density matrices delimit a regular simplex (Hypertetrahedron TN) in any dimension N; the polytope isometry group is the symmetric group SN+1, and splits TN in chambers, the orbits of the states under the projective group PU(N + 1). The type of states correlates with the vertices, edges, faces, etc. of the polytope, with the vertices making up a base of orthogonal pure states. The entropy function as a measure of the purity of these states is also easily calculable; we draw and consider some isentropic surfaces. The Casimir invariants acquire then also a more transparent interpretation. 
0808.01931	Quantum Interest in (3+1) dimensional Minkowski space	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Gabriel Abreu (Victoria University of Wellington), Matt Visser (Victoria University of Wellington)    	Abstract:  The so-called "Quantum Inequalities", and the "Quantum Interest Conjecture", use quantum field theory to impose significant restrictions on the temporal distribution of the energy density measured by a time-like observer, potentially preventing the existence of exotic phenomena such as "Alcubierre warp-drives" or "traversable wormholes". Both the quantum inequalities and the quantum interest conjecture can be reduced to statements concerning the existence or non-existence of bound states for a certain one-dimensional quantum mechanical pseudo-Hamiltonian. Using this approach, we shall provide a simple proof of one version of the Quantum Interest Conjecture in (3+1) dimensional Minkowski space. 
0808.01932	Search for TeV Scale Physics in Heavy Flavour Decays	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:George W.S. Hou	Abstract:  The subject of heavy flavour decays as probes for physics at and beyond the TeV scale is covered from the experimental perspective. Emphasis is placed on the more traditional Beyond the Standard Model topics that have potential for impact in the early LHC era, and in anticipation of the B factory upgrade(s). The aim is to explain the physics, without getting too involved in the details, whether experimental or theoretical, to give the interested nonexpert a perspective on the Flavour/TeV link. We cover the forefront topics of $CP$ violation in $b\to s$ transitions involving penguin and box diagrams, and probes of charged Higgs, right-handed and scalar interactions. We touch briefly on $Υ$ decay, $D^0$ mixing, rare $K$ decays, and lepton flavor violating probes in $τ$ decay. Our own phemonenology work is often used for illustration. 
0808.01933	Measurement-Only Topological Quantum Computation via Anyonic Interferometry	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Parsa Bonderson, Michael Freedman, Chetan Nayak	Abstract:  We describe measurement-only topological quantum computation using both projective and interferometrical measurement of topological charge. We demonstrate how anyonic teleportation can be achieved using "forced measurement" protocols for both types of measurement. Using this, it is shown how topological charge measurements can be used to generate the braiding transformations used in topological quantum computation, and hence that the physical transportation of computational anyons is unnecessary. We give a detailed discussion of the anyonics for implementation of topological quantum computation (particularly, using the measurement-only approach) in fractional quantum Hall systems. 
0808.01934	Division of the two-qubit Hilbert space according to the entanglement sudden death under composite noise environment	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Peng Li, Qun Zhang, J.Q. You	Abstract:  We show theoretically that according to the disentanglement behavior under composite noise environment, the Hilbert space of a two-qubit system can be divided into two separate parts: a 3-dimensional subspace in which all states disentangle asymptotically, and the rest in which all states disentangle abruptly. The violation of additivity for entanglement decay rates under weak noises [see, PRL 97, 140403 (2006)] therefore can be explained in terms of such division of the Hilbert space. 
0808.01935	A Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm for Factorization and Its Experimental Implementation	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Xinhua Peng, Zeyang Liao, Nanyang Xu, Gan Qin, Xianyi Zhou, Dieter Suter, Jiangfeng Du	Abstract:  We propose an adiabatic quantum algorithm capable of factorizing numbers, using fewer qubits than Shor's algorithm. We implement the algorithm in an NMR quantum information processor and experimentally factorize the number 21. Numerical simulations indicate that the running time grows only quadratically with the number of qubits. 
0808.01936	New coins from old, smoothly	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Olga Holtz, Fedor Nazarov, Yuval Peres	Abstract:  Given a (known) function $f:[0,1] \to (0,1)$, we consider the problem of simulating a coin with probability of heads $f(p)$ by tossing a coin with unknown heads probability $p$, as well as a fair coin, $N$ times each, where $N$ may be random. The work of Keane and O'Brien (1994) implies that such a simulation scheme with the probability $¶_p(N<\infty)$ equal to 1 exists iff $f$ is continuous. Nacu and Peres (2005) proved that $f$ is real analytic in an open set $S \subset (0,1)$ iff such a simulation scheme exists with the probability $¶_p(N>n)$ decaying exponentially in $n$ for every $p \in S$. We prove that for $α>0$ non-integer, $f$ is in the space $C^α[0,1]$ if and only if a simulation scheme as above exists with $¶_p(N>n) \le C (Δ_n(p))^α$, where $Δ_n(x)\eqbd \max \{\sqrt{x(1-x)/n},1/n \}$. The key to the proof is a new result in approximation theory: Let $\B_n$ be the cone of univariate polynomials with nonnegative Bernstein coefficients of degree $n$. We show that a function $f:[0,1] \to (0,1)$ is in $C^α[0,1]$ if and only if $f$ has a series representation $\sum_{n=1}^\infty F_n$ with $F_n \in \B_n$ and $\sum_{k>n} F_k(x) \le C(Δ_n(x))^α$ for all $ x \in [0,1]$ and $n \ge 1$. We also provide a counterexample to a theorem stated without proof by Lorentz (1963), who claimed that if some $φ_n \in \B_n$ satisfy $|f(x)-φ_n(x)| \le C (Δ_n(x))^α$ for all $ x \in [0,1]$ and $n \ge 1$, then $f \in C^α[0,1]$. 
0808.01937	Kaon and antikaon optical potentials in isospin asymmetric hyperonic matter	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Amruta Mishra, Arvind Kumar, Sambuddha Sanyal, Stefan Schramm	Abstract:  The medium modifications of the energies of kaons and antikaons in isospin asymmetric hyperonic matter are investigated using a chiral SU(3) model. The isospin dependent medium effects, are important for asymmetric heavy ion collision experiments, as well as relevant for the neutron star phenomenology as the bulk matter in the interior of the neutron star is highly isospin asymmetric. The effects of hyperons on the medium modifications of the kaons and antikaons in the strange hadronic matter are investigated in the present work and are seen to be appreciable for hadronic matter with large strangeness fractions. The study of the K-mesons in the asymmetric strange hadronic matter can be especially relevant for the compressed strange baryonic matter which can result from asymmetric heavy ion collision experiments in the future accelerator facility FAIR at GSI. 
0808.01938	Coherent population trapping in a dressed two-level atom via a bichromatic field	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Peng Li, Qun Zhang, Xi-Jing Ning, J. Q. You	Abstract:  We show theoretically that by applying a bichromatic electromagnetic field, the dressed states of a monochromatically driven two-level atom can be pumped into a coherent superposition termed as dressed-state coherent population trapping. Such effect can be viewed as a new doorknob to manipulate a two-level system via its control over dressed-state populations. Application of this effect in the precision measurement of Rabi frequency, the unexpected population inversion and lasing without inversion are discussed to demonstrate such controllability. 
0808.01939	Unstable Disk Galaxies. II. the Origin of Growing and Stationary Modes	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Mir Abbas Jalali	Abstract:  I decompose the unstable growing modes of stellar disks to their Fourier components and present the physical mechanism of instabilities in the context of resonances. When the equilibrium distribution function is a non-uniform function of the orbital angular momentum, the capture of stars into the corotation resonance imbalances the disk angular momentum and triggers growing bar and spiral modes. The stellar disk can then recover its angular momentum balance through the response of non-resonant stars. I carry out a complete analysis of orbital structure corresponding to each Fourier component in the radial angle, and present a mathematical condition for the occurrence of van Kampen modes, which constitute a continuous family. I discuss on the discreteness and allowable pattern speeds of unstable modes and argue that the mode growth is saturated due to the resonance overlapping mechanism. An individually growing mode can also be suppressed if the corotation and inner Lindblad resonances coexist and compete to capture a group of stars. Based on this mechanism, I show that self-consistent scale-free disks with a sufficient distribution of non-circular orbits should be stable under perturbations of angular wavenumber $m>1$. I also derive a criterion for the stability of stellar disks against non-axisymmetric excitations. 
0808.01940	Quantum computing with alkaline earth atoms	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Andrew J. Daley, Martin M. Boyd, Jun Ye, Peter Zoller	Abstract:  We present a complete scheme for quantum information processing using the unique features of alkaline earth atoms. We show how two completely independent lattices can be formed for the $^1$S$_0$ and $^3$P$_0$ states, with one used as a storage lattice for qubits encoded on the nuclear spin, and the other as a transport lattice to move qubits and perform gate operations. We discuss how the $^3$P$_2$ level can be used for addressing of individual qubits, and how collisional losses from metastable states can be used to perform gates via a lossy blockade mechanism. 
0808.01941	Perfect coupling of light to surface plasmons with ultra-narrow linewidths	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:M. Sukharev, P. R. Sievert, T. Seideman, J. B. Ketterson	Abstract:  We examine the coupling of electromagnetic waves incident normal to a thin silver film that forms an oscillatory grating embedded between two otherwise uniform, semi-infinite half spaces. Two grating structures are considered, in one of which the mid point of the Ag film remains fixed whereas the thickness varies sinusoidally, while in the other the mid point oscillates sinusoidally whereas the film thicknesses remains fixed. On reducing the light wavelength from the long wavelength limit, we encounter signatures in the transmission, T, and reflection, R, coefficients associated with: i) the short-range surface plasmon mode, ii) the long-range surface plasmon mode, and iii) electromagnetic diffraction tangent to the grating. The first two features can be regarded as generalized (plasmon) Wood's anomalies whereas the third is the first-order conventional (electromagnetic) Wood's anomaly. The energy density at the film surface is enhanced for wavelengths corresponding to these three anomalies, particularly for the long range plasmon mode in thin films. When exciting the silver film with a pair of waves incident from opposite directions, we find that by adjusting the grating oscillation amplitude and fixing the relative phase of the incoming waves to be even or odd, T+R can be made to vanish for one or the other of the plasmon modes; this corresponds to perfect coupling (impedance matching in the language of electrical engineering) between the incoming light and these modes. 
0808.01942	Logarithmic conformal field theory approach to topologically massive gravity	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Yun Soo Myung	Abstract:  We study the topologically massive gravity at the chiral point (chiral gravity) by using the logarithmic conformal field theory. Two new tensor fields of $ψ^{new}$ and $X$ are introduced for a candidate of propagating physical field at the chiral point. However, we show that ($ψ^{new},ψ^L$) form a dipole ghost pair of unphysical fields and $X$ is not a primary. This implies that there is no physically propagating degrees of freedom at the chiral point. 
0808.01943	Breakdown of the initial value formulation of scalar-tensor gravity and its physical meaning	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Valerio Faraoni, Nicolas Lanahan-Tremblay (Bishop's University)    	Abstract:  We revisit singularities of two distinct kinds in the Cauchy problem of general scalar-tensor theories of gravity (previously discussed in the literature), and of metric and Palatini f(R) gravity, in both their Jordan and Einstein frame representations. Examples and toy models are used to shed light onto the problem and it is shown that, contrary to common lore, the two conformal frames are equivalent with respect to the initial value problem. 
0808.01944	Search for new physics in $B_s$-mixing	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Alexander J. Lenz	Abstract:  We present the current status of the search for new physics effects in the mixing quantities $ΔM_s$, $ΔΓ_s$ and $φ_s$ of the neutral $B_s$-system. 
0808.01945	Correction to Relativistic Mean Field binding energy and $N_pN_n$ scheme	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Madhubrata Bhattacharya, G. Gangopadhyay	Abstract:  The differences between the experimental and Relativistic Mean Field binding energies have been calculated for a large number of even-even nuclei from A=50 to 220. Excluding certain mass regions, the differences, after suitable corrections for particular isotope chains, are found to be proportional to the Casten factor $P$, chosen as a measure of n-p interaction strength in a nucleus. Results for even-$Z$ odd-$N$ nuclei are also seen to follow the same relation, if the odd-even mass difference is taken into account following the semiempirical formula. This indicates that the n-p interaction is the major contributor to the difference between the calculated and the experimental binding energies. 
0808.01946	Next to Leading Order Chiral Perturbation theory of $K π\to π$ and $K\toππ$ amplitudes	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Changhoan Kim	Abstract:  It is shown that the low energy coefficients of the next-to-leading order (NLO) chiral perturbation theory needed to determine $ΔI=1/2$, $K\toππ$ decay amplitudes can be fixed by calculating $Kπ\toπ$ amplitudes on lattice. Unlike using NLO $K\toππ$ amplitudes proposed by Laiho and Soni, simulating $Kπ\toπ$ transitions on lattice does not require evaluations of s-channel disconnected diagrams which have been an obstacle in practice. 
0808.01947	On higher order Sugawara operators	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:A. V. Chervov, A. I. Molev	Abstract:  The higher Sugawara operators acting on the Verma modules over the affine Kac-Moody algebra at the critical level are related to the higher Hamiltonians of the Gaudin model due to work of Feigin, Frenkel and Reshetikhin. An explicit construction of the higher Hamiltonians in the case of gl_n was given recently by Talalaev. We propose a new approach to these results from the viewpoint of the vertex algebra theory by proving directly the formulas for the higher order Sugawara operators. The eigenvalues of the operators in the Wakimoto modules of critical level are also calculated. 
0808.01948	Synthesis and superconducting properties of the iron oxyarsenide TbFeAsO0.85	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Y.G. Shi, S. Yu, A.A. Belik, Y. Matsushita, M. Tanaka, Y. Katsuya, K. Kobayashi, K. Yamaura, E. Takayama-Muromachi	Abstract:  The iron oxyarsenide TbFeAsO0.85 was synthesized by a high-pressure method. A high-quality polycrystalline sample was obtained and characterized by measurements of magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity. Bulk superconductivity with Tc of 42 K was clearly established without an F doping usually conducted to tune on superconductivity in the iron oxypnictide. 
0808.01949	The effect of a stellar magnetic variation on the jet velocity	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Fabio De Colle, Jose Gracia, Gareth Murphy	Abstract:  Stellar jets are normally constituted by chains of knots with some periodicity in their spatial distribution, corresponding to a variability of order of several years in the ejection from the protostar/disk system. A widely accepted theory for the presence of knots is related to the generation of internal working surfaces due to variations in the jet ejection velocity. In this paper we study the effect of variations in the inner disk-wind radius on the jet ejection velocity. We show that a small variation in the inner disk-wind radius produce a variation in the jet velocity large enough to generate the observed knots. We also show that the variation in the inner radius may be related to a variation of the stellar magnetic field. 
0808.01950	Density, short-range order and the quark-gluon plasma	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Harvey B. Meyer	Abstract:  We study the thermal part of the energy density spatial correlator in the quark-gluon plasma. We describe its qualitative form at high temperatures. We then calculate it out to distances approx. 1.5/T in SU(3) gauge theory lattice simulations for the range of temperatures 0.9<= T/T_c<= 2.2. The vacuum-subtracted correlator exhibits non-monotonic behavior, and is almost conformal by 2T_c. Its broad maximum at r approx. 0.6/T suggests a dense medium with only weak short-range order, similar to a non-relativistic fluid near the liquid-gas phase transition, where eta/s is minimal. 
0808.01951	Half-metallic ferromagnetism in binary compounds of alkali metals with nitrogen: Ab initio calculations	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Krzysztof Zberecki, Leszek Adamowicz, Michał Wierzbicki	Abstract:  The first-principles full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method based on density functional theory is used to investigate electronic structure and magnetic properties of hypothetical binary compounds of I$^{A}$ subgroup elements with nitrogen (LiN, NaN, KN and RbN) in assumed three types of cristalline structure (rock salt, wurtzite and zinc-blende). We find that, due to the spin polarized \textit{p} orbitas of N, all four compounds are half-metallic ferromagnets with wide energy bandgaps (up to 2.0 eV). The calculated total magnetic moment in all investigated compounds for all three types of crystal structure is exactly 2.00 $μ_{\text{B}}$ per formula unit. The predicted half-metallicity is robust with respect to lattice-constant contraction. In all the cases ferromagnetic phase is energetically favored with respect to the paramagnetic one. The mechanism leading to half-metallic ferromagnetism and synthesis possibilities are discussed. 
0808.01952	Correlation of spin and velocity in granular gases	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:W. T. Kranz, N. V. Brilliantov, T. Poeschel, A. Zippelius	Abstract:  In a granular gas of rough particles the spin of a grain is correlated with its linear velocity. We develop an analytical theory to account for these correlations and compare its predictions to numerical simulations, using Direct Simulation Monte Carlo as well as Molecular Dynamics. The system is shown to relax from an arbitrary initial state to a quasi-stationary state, which is characterized by time-independent, finite correlations of spin and linear velocity. The latter are analysed systematically for a wide range of system parameters, including the coefficients of tangential and normal restitution as well as the moment of inertia of the particles. For most parameter values the axis of rotation and the direction of linear momentum are perpendicular like in a sliced tennis ball, while parallel orientation, like in a rifled bullet, occurs only for a small range of parameters. The limit of smooth spheres is singular: any arbitrarily small roughness unavoidably causes significant translation-rotation correlations, whereas for perfectly smooth spheres the rotational degrees of freedom are completely decoupled from the dynamic evolution of the gas. 
0808.01953	Dust properties and distribution in dwarf galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:U. Lisenfeld, M. Relano, J. Vilchez, E. Battaner, I. Hermelo	Abstract:  We present a study of the extinction, traced by the Balmer decrement, in HII regions in the dwarf galaxies NGC 1569 and NGC 4214. We find that the large-scale extinction around the most prominent HII regions in both galaxies forms a shell in which locally the intrinsic extinction can adopt relatively high values ($A_V = 0.8 - 0.9$ mag) despite the low metallicity and thus the low overall dust content. The small-scale extinction (spatial resolution $\sim$0.3'') shows fluctuations that are most likely due to variations in the dust distribution. We compare the distribution of the extinction to that of the dust emission, traced by Spitzer emission at 8 and 24 \mi, and to the emission of cold dust at 850 \mi. We find in general a good agreement between all tracers, expect for the 850 \mi emission in NGC 4214 which is more extended than the extinction and the other emissions. Whereas in NGC 1569 the dust emission at all wavelengths is very similar, NGC 4214 shows spatial variations in the 24-to-850 \mi ratio. We furthermore compared the 24 \mi and the extinction-corrected Halpha emission from HII regions in a sample of galaxies with a wide range of metallicities and found a good correlation between both emissions, independent of metallicity. We suggest that this lack of dependence on metallicity might be due to the formation of dust shells with a relatively constant opacity, like the ones observed here, around ionizing stars. 
0808.01954	Intermediate Phase IV in Structural Phase Transitions of TlCoCl$_3$	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Yoichi Nishiwaki, Akira Oosawa, Tetsuya Kato, Takumi Hasegawa, Haruhiko Kuroe, Kazuhisa Kakurai	Abstract:  The structural changes of TlCoCl$_3$ around phase IV (68 K $<T<$ 75 K) were studied by single-crystal neutron diffraction measurement. The present investigation revealed that a small but definite Bragg peak at (${1/6} {1/6} 2$) appeared only in phase IV. A precursor phenomenon of the phase V ($T<$ 68 K) structure in the phase IV temperatures was also identified as the coexistence of a slightly broadened (${1/4} {1/4} 2$) Bragg peak. We confirmed that intermediate phase IV is a stable, nontransient, single phase with $2\sqrt{3}a\times 2\sqrt{3}a\times c$ unit cells. A possible sequence of structural phase transitions was proposed. 
0808.01955	Action integrals and infinitesimal characters	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Andrés Viña	Abstract:  Let $G$ be a reductive Lie group and ${\mathcal O}$ the coadjoint orbit of a hyperbolic element of ${\frak g}^*$. By $π$ is denoted the unitary irreducible representation of $G$ associated with ${\mathcal O}$ by the orbit method. We give geometric interpretations in terms of concepts related to ${\mathcal O}$ of the constant $π(g)$, for $g\in Z(G)$. We also offer a description of the invariant $π(g)$ in terms of action integrals and Berry phases. In the spirit of the orbit method we interpret geometrically the infinitesimal character of the differential representation of $π$. 
0808.01956	Heteroepitaxial growth and optoelectronic properties of layered iron oxyarsenide, LaFeAsO	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Hidenori Hiramatsu, Takayoshi Katase, Toshio Kamiya, Masahiro Hirano, Hideo Hosono	Abstract:  Epitaxial thin films of LaFeAsO were fabricated on MgO (001) and mixed-perovskite (La, Sr)(Al, Ta)O3 (001) single-crystal substrates by pulsed laser deposition using a Nd:YAG second harmonic source and a 10 at.% F-doped LaFeAsO disk target. Temperature dependences of the electrical resistivities showed no superconducting transition in the temperature range of 2-300 K, and were similar to those of undoped polycrystalline bulk samples. The transmittance spectrum exhibited a clear peak at ~0.2 eV, which is explained by ab-initio calculations. 
0808.01957	Relationship between spin squeezing and single-particle coherence in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates with Josephson coupling	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:G. R. Jin, C. K. Law	Abstract:  We investigate spin squeezing of a two-mode boson system with a Josephson coupling. An exact relation between the squeezing and the single-particle coherence at the maximal-squeezing time is discovered, which provides a more direct way to measure the squeezing by readout the coherence in atomic interference experiments. We prove explicitly that the strongest squeezing is along the $J_z$ axis, indicating the appearance of atom number-squeezed state. Power laws of the strongest squeezing and the optimal coupling with particle number $N$ are obtained based upon a wide range of numerical simulations. 
0808.01958	Directed transient long-range transport in a slowly driven Hamiltonian system of interacting particles	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Dirk Hennig	Abstract:  We study the Hamiltonian dynamics of a one-dimensional chain of linearly coupled particles in a spatially periodic potential which is subjected to a time-periodic mono-frequency external field. The average over time and space of the related force vanishes and hence, the system is effectively without bias which excludes any ratchet effect. We pay special attention to the escape of the entire chain when initially all of its units are distributed in a potential well. Moreover for an escaping chain we explore the possibility of the successive generation of a directed flow based on large accelerations. We find that for adiabatic slope-modulations due to the ac-field transient long-range transport dynamics arises whose direction is governed by the initial phase of the modulation. Most strikingly, that for the driven many particle Hamiltonian system directed collective motion is observed provides evidence for the existence of families of transporting invariant tori confining orbits in ballistic channels in the high dimensional phase spaces. 
0808.01959	Macroscopic Model of Geomagnetic-Radiation from Air Showers	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Olaf Scholten, Klaus Werner	Abstract:  We have developed a macroscopic description of coherent electro-magnetic radiation from air showers initiated by ultra-high energy cosmic rays in the presence of the geo-magnetic field. This description offers a simple and direct insight in the relation between the properties of the air shower and the time-structure of the radio pulse. As we show the structure of the pulse is a direct reflection of the important length scales in the shower. 
0808.01960	Computation of the number of neutrino events which can be registered in Borexino detector from the Sun neutrinos flux with energy $E_ν= 0.862 MeV$	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Kh. M. Beshtoev	Abstract:  This paper gives an estimation of the number of neutrinos which can be registered in Borexino detector from the Sun neutrinos generated in reaction $^{7}Be + e^{-} \to ^{7}Li + ν_e$ with energy $E_{ν_e} = 0.862 MeV$ in the absence of neutrino oscillations. This number is supposed be between $ N^{theor} = 86.45 ÷96.52 \frac{counters}{(day\cdot 100\quad ton)}$ in dependence on primary neutrino fluxes. Then ratios between number of neutrinos $N^{exper}$ registered in Borexino detector and counted numbers $N^{theor}$, are $\frac{N^{exper}}{N^{theor}} = 0.49 ÷0.54$. This value is close enough to the same value obtained in $^{71}Ga - ^{71}Ge$ experiments in the close energy regions. The value $\frac{N^{exper}}{N^{theor}}$ obtained at supposition that $θ_{1 3} \approx 0$ and absence of the resonance effect approximately equal to $\simeq 0.67$ and it is noticeably greater than the above value. Probably it means that the supposition that $θ_{1 3} \approx 0$ is not justified and there can be a definite deposit of $τ$ neutrinos. 
0808.01961	The Environmental Dependence of Properties of Galaxies around the RDCSJ0910+54 Cluster at z=1.1	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Tanaka, A. Finoguenov, T. Kodama, T. Morokuma, P. Rosati, S. A. Stanford, P. Eisenhardt, B. Holden, S. Mei	Abstract:  (Abridged) We report on the environmental dependence of properties of galaxies around the RDCSJ0910+54 cluster at z=1.1. We have obtained multi-band wide-field images of the cluster with Suprime-Cam and MOIRCS on Subaru and WFCAM on UKIRT. Also, an intensive spectroscopic campaign has been carried out using LRIS on Keck and FOCAS on Subaru. We discover a possible large-scale structure around the cluster in the form of three clumps of galaxies. This is potentially one of the largest structures found so far in the z>1 Universe. We then examine stellar populations of galaxies in the structure. Red galaxies have already become the dominant population in the cores of rich clusters at z~1, and the fraction of red galaxies has not strongly changed since then. The red fraction depends on richness of clusters in the sense that it is higher in rich clusters than in poor groups. The luminosity function of red galaxies in rich clusters is consistent with that in local clusters. On the other hand, luminosity function of red galaxies in poor groups shows a deficit of faint red galaxies. This confirms our earlier findings that galaxies follow an environment-dependent down-sizing evolution. There seems to be a large variation in the evolutionary phases of galaxies in groups with similar masses. Further studies of high-z clusters will be a promising way of addressing the role of nature and nurture effects on galaxy evolution. 
0808.01962	Phenomenological covariant approach to gravity	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Qasem Exirifard	Abstract:  We covariantly modify the Einstein-Hilbert action such that the modified action perturbatively resolves the flat rotational velocity curve of the spiral galaxies and gives rise to the Tully-Fisher relation, and dynamically generates the cosmological constant. This modification requires introducing just a single new universal parameter. 
0808.01963	Dynamical correlations and collective excitations of Yukawa liquids	Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)	Authors:Zoltan Donko, Gabor J. Kalman, Peter Hartmann	Abstract:  In dusty (complex) plasmas, containing mesoscopic charged grains, the grain-grain interaction in many cases can be well described through a Yukawa potential. In this Review we summarize the basics of the computational and theoretical approaches capable of describing many-particle Yukawa systems in the liquid and solid phases and discuss the properties of the dynamical density and current correlation spectra of three- and two-dimensional strongly coupled Yukawa systems, generated by molecular dynamics simulations. We show details of the $ω(k)$ dispersion relations for the collective excitations in these systems, as obtained theoretically following the quasilocalized charge approximation, as well as from the fluctuation spectra created by simulations. The theoretical and simulation results are also compared with those obtained in complex plasma experiments. 
0808.01964	Premicellar aggregation of amphiphilic molecules: Aggregate lifetime and polydispersity	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Radina Hadgiivanova, Haim Diamant	Abstract:  A recently introduced thermodynamic model of amphiphilic molecules in solution has yielded, under certain realistic conditions, a significant presence of metastable aggregates well below the critical micelle concentration -- a phenomenon that has been reported also experimentally. The theory is extended in two directions pertaining to the experimental and technological relevance of such premicellar aggregates. (a) Combining the thermodynamic model with reaction rate theory, we calculate the lifetime of the metastable aggregates. (b) Aggregation number fluctuations are examined. We demonstrate that, over most of the metastable concentration range, the premicellar aggregates should have macroscopic lifetimes and small polydispersity. 
0808.01965	Nonstandard Mathematics and New Zeta and L-Functions	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Benjamin Clare	Abstract:  This Ph.D. thesis, prepared under the supervision of Professor Ivan Fesenko, defines new zeta functions in a nonstandard setting and their analytical properties are developed. Further, p-adic interpolation is presented within a nonstandard setting which enables the concept of interpolating with respect to two, or more, distinct primes to be defined. The final part of the dissertation examines the work of M. J. Shai Haran and makes initial attempts of viewing it from a nonstandard perspective. 
0808.01966	Extremely short-length surface plasmon resonance sensors	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Maxim L. Nesterov, Alexandre V. Kats, Sergei K. Turitsyn	Abstract:  The impact of the system design on the control of coupling between planar waveguide modes and surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) is analyzed. We examine how the efficiency of the coupling can be enhanced by an appropriate dimensioning of a multi-layer device structure without using additional gratings. We demonstrate that by proper design the length of the device can be dramatically reduced through fabrication a surface plasmon resonance sensor based on the SPP-photon transformation rather then on SPP dissipation. 
0808.01967	Electromagnetic energy and momentum in moving media	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Yuri N. Obukhov	Abstract:  The problem of the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor is among the oldest and the most controversial in macroscopic electrodynamics. In the center of the issue is a dispute about the Minkowski and the Abraham tensors for moving media. An overview of the current situation is presented. After putting the discussion into a general Lagrange-Noether framework, the Minkowski tensor is recovered as a canonical energy-momentum. It is shown that the balance equations of energy, momentum, and angular momentum are always satisfied for an open electromagnetic system despite the lack of the symmetry of the canonical tensor. On the other hand, although the Abraham tensor is not defined from first principles, one can formulate a general symmetrization prescription provided a timelike vector is available. We analyze in detail the variational model of a relativistic ideal fluid with isotropic electric and magnetic properties interacting with the electromagnetic field. The relation between the Minkowski energy-momentum tensor, the canonical energy-momentum of the medium and the Abraham tensor is clarified. It is demonstrated that the Abraham energy-momentum is relevant when the 4-velocity of matter is the only covariant variable that enters the constitutive tensor. 
0808.01968	LSD and AMAZE: the mass-metallicity relation at z>3	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:F. Mannucci, R. Maiolino, for the LSD collaboration, AMAZE collaboration	Abstract:  We present the first results on galaxy metallicity evolution at z>3 from two projects, LSD (Lyman-break galaxies Stellar populations and Dynamics) and AMAZE (Assessing the Mass Abundance redshift Evolution). These projects use deep near-infrared spectroscopic observations of a sample of ~40 LBGs to estimate the gas-phase metallicity from the emission lines. We derive the mass-metallicity relation at z$>$3 and compare it with the same relation at lower redshift. Strong evolution from z=0 and z=2 to z=3 is observed, and this finding puts strong constrains on the models of galaxy evolution. These preliminary results show that the effective oxygen yields does not increase with stellar mass, implying that the simple outflow model does not apply at z>3. 
0808.01969	Determination of the single-ion anisotropy energy in a S = 5/2 kagome antiferromagnet using X-ray absorption spectroscopy	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:M. A. de Vries, T. K. Johal, A. Mirone, J. S. Claydon, G. J. Nilsen, H. M. Ronnow, G. van der Laan, A. Harrison	Abstract:  We report x-ray absorption and x-ray linear dichroism measurements at the Fe L2,3 edges of the geometrically frustrated systems of potassium and hydronium iron jarosite. Comparison with simulated spectra, involving ligand-field multiplet calculations modelling the 3d-2p hybridization between the iron ion and the oxygen ligands, has yielded accurate estimates for the ligand metal-ion hybridization and the resulting single-ion crystal field anisotropy energy. Using this method we provide an experimentally verified scenario for the appearance of a single-ion anisotropy in this nominally high-spin 3d5 orbital singlet 6S system, which accounts for features of the spin-wave dispersion in the long-range ordered ground state of potassium iron jarosite. 
0808.01970	A search for associated W and Higgs Boson production in ppbar collisions at sqrt{s}=1.96 TeV	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:D0 Collaboration	Abstract:  We present results of a search for WH -> lepton neutrino b bbar production in ppbar collisions based on the analysis of 1.05 fb-1 of data collected by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron, using a neural network for separating the signal from backgrounds. No signal-like excess is observed, and we set 95 % C.L. upper limits on the WH production cross section multiplied by the branching ratio for H->bb for Higgs boson masses between 100 and 150 GeV. For a Higgs boson mass of 115 GeV, we obtain an observed (expected) limit of 1.5 (1.4) pb, a factor of 11.4 (10.7) times larger than standard model prediction. 
0808.01971	Intertwiner dynamics in the flipped vertex	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Emanuele Alesci, Eugenio Bianchi, Elena Magliaro, Claudio Perini	Abstract:  We continue the semiclassical analysis, started in a previous paper, of the intertwiner sector of the flipped vertex spinfoam model. We use independently both a semi-analytical and a purely numerical approach, finding the correct behavior of wave packet propagation and physical expectation values. In the end, we show preliminary results about correlation functions. 
0808.01972	De Morgan's law and the theory of fields	Category Theory (math.CT)	Authors:Olivia Caramello, Peter Johnstone	Abstract:  We show that the classifying topos for the theory of fields does not satisfy De Morgan's law, and we identify its largest dense De Morgan subtopos as the classifying topos for the theory of fields of nonzero characteristic which are algebraic over their prime fields. 
0808.01973	MHV Lagrangians for Yang--Mills and QCD	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:James H. Ettle	Abstract:  Over the past few decades, it has been realised that gauge theory scattering amplitudes have structures much simpler than the traditional Feynman graph driven approach would suggest. In particular, Parke and Taylor found a particularly simple expression for the tree-level amplitudes with two gluons of different helicity than the others (the so-called MHV amplitudes). Cachazo, Svrcek and Witten (CSW) devised rules for constructing tree-level amplitudes by sewing lower-valence MHV amplitudes together with scalar propagators. It was shown by Mansfield in 2005 that a canonical change of the field variables could be constructed that resulted in a lagrangian whose vertices were proportional to MHV amplitudes, continued off-shell by CSW's prescription, the so-called Canonical MHV Lagrangian. We derive the explicit form of this transformation and use this to show that the vertices are indeed the Parke--Taylor amplitudes for up to five gluons. Noting that CSW's MHV rules cannot be used to construct the tree-level (-++) or one-loop (++++) amplitudes, we extend our work to augment the MHV rules with so-called completion vertices. These permit construction of these missing amplitudes by means of evasion of the S-matrix equivalence theorem. Indeed, together they reconstruct off-shell light-cone Yang-Mills amplitudes algebraically. We also give a prescription for dimensional regularisation of the Canonical MHV Lagrangian. Finally, we construct a canonical MHV lagrangian with massless fermions in the fundamental representation using a similar methodology. 
0808.01974	Calculating intersection numbers on moduli spaces of pointed curves	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Stephanie Yang	Abstract:  This is a note on calculating intersection numbers on moduli spaces of curves. A codimension 3 relation among tautological classes on the moduli space of genus 4 curves is given. 
0808.01975	N-Complexes and Higher Spin Gauge Fields	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Marc Henneaux	Abstract:  $N$-complexes have been argued recently to be algebraic structures relevant to the description of higher spin gauge fields. $N$-complexes involve a linear operator $d$ that fulfills $d^N = 0$ and that defines a generalized cohomology. Some elementary properties of $N$-complexes and the evidence for their relevance to the description of higher spin gauge fields are briefly reviewed. 
0808.01976	Deformed quantum mechanics and q-Hermitian operators	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:A. Lavagno	Abstract:  Starting on the basis of the non-commutative q-differential calculus, we introduce a generalized q-deformed Schrödinger equation. It can be viewed as the quantum stochastic counterpart of a generalized classical kinetic equation, which reproduces at the equilibrium the well-known q-deformed exponential stationary distribution. In this framework, q-deformed adjoint of an operator and q-hermitian operator properties occur in a natural way in order to satisfy the basic quantum mechanics assumptions. 
0808.01977	Visualization of Superfluid Helium Flow	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Matthew S. Paoletti, Ralph B. Fiorito, Katepalli R. Sreenivasan, Daniel P. Lathrop	Abstract:  We discuss an experimental technique to visualize the motion in the bulk of superfluid $^4$He by tracking micron-sized solid hydrogen tracers. The behavior of the tracers is complex since they may be trapped by the quantized vortices while also interacting with the normal fluid via Stokes drag. We discuss the mechanism by which tracers may be trapped by quantized vortices as well as the dependencies on hydrogen volume fraction, temperature, and flow properties. We apply this technique to study the dynamics of a thermal counterflow. Our observations serve as a direct confirmation of the two-fluid model as well as a quantitative test of the normal fluid velocity dependence on the applied heat flux. 
0808.01978	Conformally Invariant Operators via Curved Casimirs: Examples	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Andreas Cap, A. Rod Gover, Vladimir Soucek	Abstract:  We discuss a general scheme for a construction of linear conformally invariant differential operators from curved Casimir operators; we then explicitly carry this out for several examples. Apart from demonstrating the efficacy of the approach via curved Casimirs, this shows that this method applies both in regular and in singular infinitesimal character, and also that it can be used to construct standard as well as non--standard operators. The examples treated include conformally invariant operators with leading term, in one case, a square of the Laplacian, and in another case, a cube of the Laplacian. 
0808.01979	$π$-junction qubit in monolayer graphene	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Colin Benjamin, Jiannis K. Pachos	Abstract:  We propose to combine the advantages of graphene, such as easy tunability and long coherence times, with Josephson physics to manufacture qubits. If these qubits are built around a 0 and $π$ junction they can be controlled by an external flux. Alternatively, a d-wave Josephson junction can itself be tuned via a gate voltage to create superpositions between macroscopically degenerate states. We show that ferromagnets are not required for realizing $π$ junction in graphene, thus considerably simplifying its physical implementation. We demonstrate how one qubit gates, such as arbitrary phase rotations and the exchange gate, can be implemented. 
0808.01980	An Iterative Method for Constructing Equilibrium Phase Models of Stellar Systems	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S.A. Rodionov, E. Athanassoula, N.Ya Sotnikova	Abstract:  We present a new method for constructing equilibrium phase models for stellar systems, which we call the iterative method. It relies on constrained, or guided evolution, so that the equilibrium solution has a number of desired parameters and/or constraints. This method is very powerful, to a large extent due to its simplicity. It can be used for mass distributions with an arbitrary geometry and a large variety of kinematical constraints. We present several examples illustrating it. Applications of this method include the creation of initial conditions for N-body simulations and the modelling of galaxies from their photometric and kinematic observations. 
0808.01981	Planar Heterostructure Graphene -- Narrow-Gap Semiconductor -- Graphene	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:P. V. Ratnikov, A. P. Silin	Abstract:  We investigate a planar heterostructure composed of two graphene films separated by a narrow-gap semiconductor ribbon. We show that there is no the Klein paradox when the Dirac points of the Brillouin zone of graphene are in a band gap of a narrow-gap semiconductor. There is the energy range depending on an angle of incidence, in which the above-barrier damped solution exists. Therefore, this heterostructure is a "filter" transmitting particles in a certain range of angles of incidence upon a potential barrier. We discuss the possibility of an application of this heterostructure as a "switch". 
0808.01982	Statistical QCD with non-positive measure	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:J.C. Osborn, K. Splittorff, J.J.M. Verbaarschot	Abstract:  In this talk we discuss the microscopic limit of QCD at nonzero chemical potential. In this domain, where the QCD partition function is under complete analytical control, we uncover an entirely new link between the spectral density of the Dirac operator and the chiral condensate: violent complex oscillations on the microscopic scale give rise to the discontinuity of the chiral condensate at zero quark mass. We first establish this relation exactly within a random matrix framework and then analyze the importance of the individual modes by Fourier analysis. 
0808.01983	Ratchet effects induced by terahertz radiation in heterostructures with a lateral periodic potential	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:P. Olbrich, E.L. Ivchenko, T. Feil, R. Ravash, S.D. Danilov, J. Allerdings, D. Weiss, S.D. Ganichev	Abstract:  We report on the observation of terahertz radiation induced photogalvanic currents in semiconductor heterostructures with one-dimensional lateral periodic potential. The potential is produced by etching a grating into the sample surface. The electric current response is well described by phenomenological theory including both the circular and linear photogalvanic effects. Experimental data demonstrate that the inversion asymmetry of the periodic lateral pattern can be varied by means of electron beam lithography to produce classical lateral ratchets. A novel microscopical mechanism for the polarization-dependent photogalvanic effects has been proposed to interpret the experimental findings. The photocurrent generation is based on the combined action of the lateral periodic potential and the modulated in-plane pumping. The latter modulation stems from near-field effects of the radiation propagating through the grating. 
0808.01984	Detection of 6.7 GHz methanol absorption towards hot corinos	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. D. Pandian, S. Leurini, K. M. Menten, A. Belloche, P. F. Goldsmith	Abstract:  Methanol masers at 6.7 GHz have been found exclusively towards high-mass star forming regions. Recently, some Class 0 protostars have been found to display conditions similar to what are found in hot cores that are associated with massive star formation. These hot corino sources have densities, gas temperatures, and methanol abundances that are adequate for exciting strong 6.7 GHz maser emission. This raises the question of whether 6.7 GHz methanol masers can be found in both hot corinos and massive star forming regions, and if not, whether thermal methanol emission can be detected. We searched for the 6.7 GHz methanol line towards five hot corino sources in the Perseus region using the Arecibo radio telescope. To constrain the excitation conditions of methanol, we observed thermal submillimeter lines of methanol in the NGC1333-IRAS 4 region with the APEX telescope. We did not detect 6.7 GHz emission in any of the sources, but found absorption against the cosmic microwave background in NGC1333-IRAS 4A and NGC1333-IRAS 4B. Using a large velocity gradient analysis, we modeled the excitation of methanol over a wide range of physical parameters, and verify that the 6.7 GHz line is indeed strongly anti-inverted for densities lower than 10^6 cm^-3. We used the submillimeter observations of methanol to verify the predictions of our model for IRAS 4A by comparison with other CH3OH transitions. Our results indicate that the methanol observations from the APEX and Arecibo telescopes are consistent with dense (n ~ 10^6 cm^-3), cold (T ~ 15-30 K) gas. The lack of maser emission in hot corinos and low-mass protostellar objects in general may be due to densities that are much higher than the quenching density in the region where the radiation field is conducive to maser pumping. 
0808.01985	Superconductivity in Epitaxial Thin Films of Co-Doped SrFe2As2 with Bilayered FeAs Structures and their Magnetic Anisotropy	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Hidenori Hiramatsu, Takayoshi Katase, Toshio Kamiya, Masahiro Hirano, Hideo Hosono	Abstract:  Superconducting epitaxial films of Fe-based layered arsenide, Co-doped SrFe2As2, were grown at 700oC on mixed perovskite (La, Sr)(Al, Ta)O3 (001) single-crystal substrates by pulsed-laser deposition. Both the epitaxial film and an (001)-oriented film grown at 600oC exhibited superconducting transitions at ~ 20 K. The zero-resistance states of the epitaxial film were sustained under a magnetic field (H) of 9 T at 9 K when H was parallel to the c-axis, while they were sustained at higher temperatures up to 10 K for H parallel to the a-axis. This is the first demonstration of superconducting thin films of FeAs-based new superconductors. 
0808.01986	Finite Volume Scaling of Pseudo Nambu-Goldstone Bosons in QCD	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:F. Bernardoni, P. H. Damgaard, H. Fukaya, P. Hernández	Abstract:  We consider chiral perturbation theory in a finite volume and in a mixed regime of quark masses. We take N_l light quarks near the chiral limit, in the so-called epsilon-regime, while the remaining N_h quarks are heavier and in the standard p-regime. We compute in this new mixed regime the finite-size scaling of the light meson correlators in the scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and axial vector channels.Using the replica method, we easily extend our results to the partially quenched theory. With the help of our results, lattice QCD simulations with 2+1 flavors can safely investigate pion physics with very light up and down quark masses even in the region where the pion's correlation length overcomes the size of the space-time lattice. 
0808.01987	Photogalvanic effects due to quantum interference in optical transitions demonstrated by terahertz radiation absorption in Si-MOSFETs	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:P. Olbrich, S.A. Tarasenko, C. Reitmaier, J. Karch, D. Plohmann, Z.D. Kvon, S.D. Ganichev	Abstract:  We report on the observation of the circular (helicity-dependent) and linear photogalvanic effects in Si-MOSFETs with inversion channels. The developed microscopic theory demonstrates that the circular photogalvanic effect in Si structures it is of pure orbital nature originating from the quantum interference of different pathways contributing to the light absorption. 
0808.01988	A tunable narrowband entangled photon pair source for resonant single-photon single-atom interaction	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Albrecht Haase, Nicolas Piro, Jürgen Eschner, Morgan W. Mitchell	Abstract:  We present a tunable, frequency-stabilized, narrow-bandwidth source of frequency-degenerate, entangled photon pairs. The source is based on spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) in periodically-poled KTiOPO4 (PPKTP). Its wavelength can be stabilized to 850 or 854 nm, thus allowing to address two D-P transitions in 40Ca+ ions. Its output bandwidth of 22 MHz coincides with the absorption bandwidth of the calcium ions. Its spectral power density is 1.0 generated pairs/(s MHz mW). 
0808.01989	Charged pions multiplicities at the NA49 energy	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Adam Bzdak	Abstract:  The wounded quark-diquark model predictions for charged pions multiplicities in PbPb and pPb collisions in the central rapidity region at sqrt(s)=17.3 GeV c.m. energy are presented. 
0808.01990	Measurement of spatial qubits	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:G. Lima, F.A. Torres-Ruiz, L. Neves, A. Delgado, C. Saavedra, S. Padua	Abstract:  In this paper we study the state determination for composite systems of two spatial qubits. We show, theoretically, that one can use the technique of quantum tomography to reconstruct the density matrixes of these systems. This tomographic reconstruction is based on the free evolution of the spatial qubits and a postelection process. 
0808.01991	d-collapsibility is NP-complete for d greater or equal to 4	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Martin Tancer	Abstract:  A simplicial complex is d-collapsible if it can be reduced to an empty complex by repeatedly removing (collapsing) a face of dimension at most d-1 that is contained in a unique maximal face. We prove that the algorithmic question whether a given simplicial complex is d-collapsible is NP-complete for d greater or equal to 4 and polynomial time solvable for d at most 2. As an intermediate step, we prove that d-collapsibility can be recognized by the greedy algorithm for d at most 2, but the greedy algorithm does not work for d greater or equal 3. A simplicial complex is d-representable if it is the nerve of a collection of convex sets in R^d. The main motivation for studying d-collapsible complexes is that every d-representable complex is d-collapsible. We also observe that known results imply that analogical algorithmic question for d-representable complexes is NP-hard for d greater or equal to 2. 
0808.01992	On visualisation scaling, subeigenvectors and Kleene stars in max algebra	Metric Geometry (math.MG)	Authors:Sergei Sergeev, Hans Schneider, Peter Butkovic	Abstract:  The purpose of this paper is to investigate the interplay arising between max algebra, convexity and scaling problems. The latter, which have been studied in nonnegative matrix theory, are strongly related to max algebra. One problem is strict visualisation scaling, which means finding, for a given nonnegative matrix A, a diagonal matrix X such that all elements of X^{-1}AX are less than or equal to the maximum cycle geometric mean of A, with strict inequality for the entries which do not lie on critical cycles. In this paper such scalings are described by means of the max-algebraic subeigenvectors and Kleene stars of nonnegative matrices as well as by some concepts of convex geometry. 
0808.01993	Symmetry breaking in low-dimensional SU(N) antiferromagnets	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Alexei Kolezhuk	Abstract:  Consequences of explicit symmetry breaking in a physically motivated model of SU(N) antiferromagnet in spatial dimensions one and two are studied. It is shown that the case N=3, which can be realized in spin-1 cold atom systems, displays special properties distinctly different from those for N>=4. Qualitative form of the phase diagram depending on the model parameters is given. 
0808.01994	Short seed extractors against quantum storage	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Amnon Ta-Shma	Abstract:  Some, but not all, extractors resist adversaries with limited quantum storage. In this paper we show that Trevisan's extractor has this property, thereby showing an extractor against quantum storage with logarithmic seed length. 
0808.01995	Local complementation rule for continuous-variable four-mode unweighted graph states	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Jing Zhang	Abstract:  The local complementation rule is applied for continuous-variable (CV) graph states in the paper, which is an elementary graph transformation rule and successive application of which generates the orbit of any graph states. The corresponding local Gaussian transformations of local complementation for four-mode unweighted graph states were found, which do not mirror the form of the local Clifford unitary of qubit exactly. This work is an important step to characterize the local Gaussian equivalence classes of CV graph states. 
0808.01996	Torelli theorem for the moduli space of framed bundles	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Indranil Biswas, Tomas L. Gomez, Vicente Muñoz	Abstract:  Let X be an irreducible smooth complex projective curve of genus g>2, and let x be a fixed point. A framed bundle is a pair (E,φ), where E is a vector bundle over X, of rank r and degree d, and φ:E_x\to C^r is a non-zero homomorphism. There is a notion of (semi)stability for framed bundles depending on a parameter τ>0, which gives rise to the moduli space of τ-semistable framed bundles M^τ. We prove a Torelli theorem for M^τ, for τ>0 small enough, meaning, the isomorphism class of the one-pointed curve (X,x), and also the integer r, are uniquely determined by the isomorphism class of the variety M^τ. 
0808.01997	Stability of AdS black strings	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:T. Delsate	Abstract:  We review the recent developements in the stability problem and phase diagram for asymptotically locally $AdS$ black strings. First, we quickly review the case of locally flat black string before turning to the case of locally $AdS$ spacetimes. 
0808.01998	Classes of exact Einstein-Maxwell solutions	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:K. Komathiraj, S. D. Maharaj	Abstract:  We find new classes of exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell system of equations for a charged sphere with a particular choice of the electric field intensity and one of the gravitational potentials. The condition of pressure isotropy is reduced to a linear, second order differential equation which can be solved in general. Consequently we can find exact solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell field equations corresponding to a static spherically symmetric gravitational potential in terms of hypergeometric functions. It is possible to find exact solutions which can be written explicitly in terms of elementary functions, namely polynomials and product of polynomials and algebraic functions. Uncharged solutions are regainable with our choice of electric field intensity; in particular we generate the Einstein universe for particular parameter values. 
0808.01999	Decoherence measure by gravitational wave interferometers	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Yasushi Mino	Abstract:  We consider the possibility to measure the quantum decoherence using gravitational wave interferometers. Gravitational wave interferometers create the superposition state of photons and measure the interference of the photon state. If the decoherence occurs, the interference of the photon state vanishes and it can be measured by the interferometers. As examples of decoherence mechanisms, we consider 1) decoherence by spontaneous localization, 2) gravitational decoherence and 3) decoherence by extra-dimensional gravity. 
0808.02000	Reconsidering the asymptotic null distribution of likelihood ratio tests for genetic linkage in multivariate variance components models	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:Summer S. Han, Joseph T. Chang	Abstract:  Accurate knowledge of the null distribution of hypothesis tests is important for valid application of the tests. In previous papers and software, the asymptotic null distribution of likelihood ratio tests for detecting genetic linkage in multivariate variance components models has been stated to be a mixture of chi-square distributions with binomial mixing probabilities. Here we show, by simulation and by theoretical arguments based on the geometry of the parameter space, that all aspects of the previously stated asymptotic null distribution are incorrect--both the binomial mixing probabilities and the chi-square components. Correcting the null distribution gives more conservative critical values than previously stated, yielding P values that can easily be ten times larger. The true mixing probabilities give the highest probability to the case where all variance parameters are estimated positive, and the mixing components show severe departures from chi-square distributions. Thus, the asymptotic null distribution has complex features that raise challenges for the assessment of significance of multivariate linkage findings. We propose a method to generate an asymptotic null distribution that is much faster than other empirical methods such as gene-dropping, enabling us to obtain P values with higher precision more efficiently. 
0808.02001	High-output CPP-GMR sensor with synthetic-ferrimagnet free layer and enhanced spin-torque critical currents	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:M.J. Carey, Neil Smith, S. Maat, J.R. Childress	Abstract:  It is shown that the maximum stable output of a CPP-GMR sensor is increased significantly by using a synthetic ferrimagnet free layer, provided the electron current flows from free layer to reference layer. This free layer allows a larger magnetoresistance ratio for a given free layer magnetic moment, and in addition results in a greater than three-fold increase in the critical current above which spin-torque instability of the free layer occurs. In read heads with net free layer moments equivalent to only 4.5nm of Ni80Fe20, this effect is shown to result in sustainable sense current densities above 2e8 A/cm2. 
0808.02002	An application of Jacquet-Langlands correspondence to transfer operators for geodesic flows on Riemann surfaces	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Arash Momeni, Alexei Venkov	Abstract:  In the paper as a new application of the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence we connect the transfer operators for different cofinite Fuchsian groups by comparing the corresponding Selberg zeta functions. 
0808.02003	Lossless Quantum Prefix Compression for Communication Channels that are Always Open	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Markus Mueller, Caroline Rogers, Rajagopal Nagarajan	Abstract:  We describe a method for lossless quantum compression if the output of the information source is not known. We compute the best possible compression rate, minimizing the expected base length of the output quantum bit string (the base length of a quantum string is the maximal length in the superposition). This complements work by Schumacher and Westmoreland who calculated the corresponding rate for minimizing the output's average length. Our compressed code words are prefix-free indeterminate-length quantum bit strings which can be concatenated in the case of multiple sources. Therefore, we generalize the known theory of prefix-free quantum codes to the case of strings with indeterminate length. Moreover, we describe a communication model which allows the lossless transmission of the compressed code words. The benefit of compression is then the reduction of transmission errors in the presence of noise. 
0808.02004	The Bäcklund transforms of Peterson's deformations of quadrics	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Ion I. Dinca	Abstract:  In trying to provide explicit deformations of quadrics the starting point of our investigation is to use Bianchi's link between real deformations of totally real regions of real paraboloids and various totally real forms of the sine-Gordon equation coupled with Bianchi's simple observation that the vacuum soliton of these totally real forms of the sine-Gordon equation provides precisely Peterson's deformations of such quadrics in order to derive explicit Bäcklund transforms of Peterson's deformations of quadrics. Based also on Bianchi's approach of the Bäcklund transformation for quadrics via common conjugate systems and in analogy to the solitons of the sine-Gordon equation corresponding at the level of the geometric picture to the solitons of the pseudo-sphere we propose a model for the solitons of quadrics. 
0808.02005	On secant loci and simple linear projections of some projective varieties	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Euisung Park	Abstract:  In this paper, we study how simple linear projections of some projective varieties behave when the projection center runs through the ambient space. More precisely, let $X \subset ¶^r$ be a projective variety satisfying Green-Lazarsfeld's property $N_p$ for some $p \geq 2$, $q \in ¶^r$ a closed point outside of $X$, and $X_q := π_q (X) \subset ¶^{r-1}$ the projected image of $X$ from $q$. First, it is shown that the secant locus $Σ_q (X)$ of $X$ with respect to $q$, i.e. the set of all points on $X$ spanning secant lines passing through $q$, is either empty or a quadric in a subspace of $¶^r$. This implies that the finite morphism $π_q : X \to X_q$ is birational. Our main result is that cohomological and local properties of $X_q$ are precisely determined by $Σ_q (X)$. To complete this result, the next step should be to classify all possible secant loci and to decompose the ambient space via the classification of secant loci. We obtain such a decomposition for Veronese embeddings and Segre embeddings. Also as an application of the main result, we study cohomological properties of low degree varieties. 
0808.02006	The increase with energy of the parton transverse momenta in the current fragmentation region and related pQCD phenomena in DIS at very high energies	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:B.Blok, L. Frankfurt, M. Strikman	Abstract:  We find, within the pQCD dipole model for DIS processes, a rapid increase with energy of the scale of parton momenta in the current fragmentation region in the limit $s\to \infty$ and fixed $Q^2$ . We explain the equivalence between the dispersion representation over $Q^2$ for LT pQCD zero angle amplitude of $γ^*+T\to γ^*+T$ scattering at large energies and the $k_t$ factorization, and use it to evaluate the scales of the hard processes in the current fragmentation region. We derive within the black disc (BD) regime the modified Gribov formula for the total cross-section of the DIS. We evaluate the coherence length of the processes relevant for the BD regime and find that it increases with energy as $\sim s^{0.6}$ i.e. significantly slower than in the parton model ($1/2m_Nx$ - the Ioffe length) as well as in pQCD. In the BD regime we estimate the gluon densities, local in the coordinate space, and find that they do not decrease with the energy. We discuss briefly how the new pQCD phenomena may reveal itself in the proton-proton collisions at LHC 
0808.02007	Bianchi's Bäcklund transformation for higher dimensional quadrics	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Ion I. Dinca	Abstract:  We provide a generalization of Bianchi's Bäcklund transformation from 2-dimensional quadrics to higher dimensional quadrics. The starting point of our investigation is the higher dimensional (infinitesimal) version of Bianchi's main four theorems on the theory of deformations of quadrics and Bianchi's treatment of the Bäcklund transformation for diagonal paraboloids via conjugate systems. 
0808.02008	Stably diffeomorphic manifolds and l_{2q+1}(Z[π])	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Diarmuid Crowley, Jörg Sixt	Abstract:  The monoids l_{2q+1}(Z[π]) detect s-cobordisms amongst certain bordisms between stably diffeomorphic 2q-dimensional manifolds and generalise the Wall simple surgery obstruction groups, L_{2q+1}^s(Z[π]) \subset l_{2q+1}(Z[π]). In this paper we give exact sequences which completely describe l_{2q+1}(Z[π]) as a set and which we use to compute its Grothendieck group. As a consequence we deduce cancellation results for stably diffeomorphic manifolds with polycyclic-by-finite fundamental group. 
0808.02009	Thermo-Poro-Mechanical Properties of Clayey Gouge and Application to Rapid Fault Shearing	Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)	Authors:Jean Sulem (ENPC-Cermes), Paul Lazar (ENPC-Cermes), Ioannis Vardoulakis	Abstract:  In this paper, the mechanism of fault pressurization in rapid slip events is analyzed on the basis of a complete characterization of the thermo-poro-mechanical behavior of a clayey gouge extracted at 760m depth in Aigion fault in the active seismic zone of the Gulf of Corinth, Greece. It is shown that the thermally collapsible character of this clayey gouge can be responsible for a dramatic reduction of effective stress and a full fluidization of the material. The thickness of the 'ultra localized' zone of highly strained material is a key parameter that controls the competing phenomena of pore pressure increase leading to fluidization of the fault gouge and temperature increase leading to pore fluid vaporization. 
0808.02010	Dynamical Quantum Memories	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Q. Y. He, M. D. Reid, E. Giacobino, J. Cviklinski, P. D Drummond	Abstract:  We propose a dynamical approach to quantum memories using an oscillator-cavity model. This overcomes the known difficulties of achieving high quantum input-output fidelity with storage times long compared to the input signal duration. We use a generic model of the memory response, which is applicable to any linear storage medium ranging from a superconducting device to an atomic medium. The temporal switching or gating of the device may either be through a control field changing the coupling, or through a variable detuning approach, as in more recent quantum memory experiments. An exact calculation of the temporal memory response to an external input is carried out. This shows that there is a mode-matching criterion which determines the optimum input and output mode shape. This optimum pulse shape can be modified by changing the gate characteristics. In addition, there is a critical coupling between the atoms and the cavity that allows high fidelity in the presence of long storage times. The quantum fidelity is calculated both for the coherent state protocol, and for a completely arbitrary input state with a bounded total photon number. We show how a dynamical quantum memory can surpass the relevant classical memory bound, while retaining a relatively long storage time. 
0808.02011	Finite element analysis of the indentation test on rocks with microstructure	Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)	Authors:Jean Sulem (ENPC-CERMES), Miguel Cerrolaza	Abstract:  Strength parameters of rocks are currently determined from indentation tests. In this paper, a finite element analysis of this test is presented and scale effect is studied. The rock is modelled as an elasto-plastic medium with Cosserat microstructure and consequently possesses an internal length. The response of the indentation curve is studied for various values of the size of the indentor as compared to the internal length of the rock in order to assess the scale effect. 
0808.02012	Stress orientation evaluated from strain localisation analysis in Aigion fault	Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)	Authors:Jean Sulem (ENPC-Cermes)    	Abstract:  Within the frame of the 'CRL' (Corinth Rift Laboratory project) (Cornet et al, 2004a) centered on the south western sector of the Gulf of Corinth (this http URL), fault zone cores from the active Aigion fault have been collected continuously from depths between 708 m to 782 m. Inside this clayey core, a clear shearing surface with marked slip lines is visible on a plane that makes a 68 degree angle with respect to the core axis. This failure surface was not induced by the decompression process but is indeed a slip plane as clear striation is observed at the interface. On the basis of an elastoplastic constitutive model calibrated on triaxial tests on the clayey gouge, it is shown that shear band formation inside the clayey core is possible. The solution for the orientation of the shear band is compared to the orientation of an existing slip surface inside the clayey gouge and this result is used to deduce the orientation of the principal stresses. It is shown that as commonly observed in weak fault zones, the orientation of the principal stresses is locally almost parallel and perpendicular to the fault axis. 
0808.02013	Perfect, strongly eutactic lattices are periodic extreme	Metric Geometry (math.MG)	Authors:Achill Schürmann	Abstract:  We introduce a parameter space for periodic point sets, given as unions of $m$ translates of point lattices. In it we investigate the behavior of the sphere packing density function and derive sufficient conditions for local optimality. Using these criteria we prove that perfect, strongly eutactic lattices cannot be locally improved to yield a periodic sphere packing with greater density. This applies in particular to the densest known lattice sphere packings in dimension $d\leq 8$ and $d=24$. 
0808.02014	Manifestations of CP Violation in the MSSM Higgs Sector	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Jae Sik Lee	Abstract:  We demonstrate how CP violation manifests itself in the Higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). Starting with a brief introduction to CP violation in the MSSM and its effects on the Higgs sector, we discuss some phenomenological aspects of the Higgs sector CP violation based on the two scenarios called CPX and Trimixing 
0808.02015	Co-resonant enhancement of spin-torque critical currents in spin-valves with synthetic-ferrimagnet free-layer	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Neil Smith, Stefan Maat, Matthew J. Carey, Jeffrey R. Childress	Abstract:  It is experimentally shown that the critical current for onset of spin-torque instability in current-perpendicular-to-plane spin-valves can be strongly enhanced using "synthetic ferrimagnet" free-layers of form FM1/Ru/FM2 (FM=ferrromagnet). However, this enhancement occurs for only one polarity of bias current. A two-macrospin model is shown to reproduce the observations. The model suggests that this phenomenon is related to a polarity-dependent, spin-torque induced co-resonance between the two natural dynamic modes of the FM1/FM2 couple. The resonance condition facilitates energy transfer out of the spin-torque destabilized mode into the other stable mode whose effective damping is actually enhanced by spin-torques, thereby delaying the onset of instability of this coupled system to larger critical currents. 
0808.02016	Three-flavour neutrino oscillation update	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Thomas Schwetz, Mariam Tortola, Jose W.F. Valle	Abstract:  We review the present status of three-flavour neutrino oscillations, taking into account the latest available neutrino oscillation data presented at the Neutrino 2008 Conference. This includes the data released this summer by the MINOS collaboration, the data of the neutral current counter phase of the SNO solar neutrino experiment, as well as the latest KamLAND and Borexino data. We give the updated determinations of the leading 'solar' and 'atmospheric' oscillation parameters. We find from global data that the mixing angle $θ_{13}$ is consistent with zero within $0.9σ$ and we derive an upper bound of $\sin^2θ_{13} < 0.035 (0.056)$ at 90% CL (3$σ$). 
0808.02017	Nearly Tight Low Stretch Spanning Trees	Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)	Authors:Ittai Abraham, Yair Bartal, Ofer Neiman	Abstract:  We prove that any graph $G$ with $n$ points has a distribution $\mathcal{T}$ over spanning trees such that for any edge $(u,v)$ the expected stretch $E_{T \sim \mathcal{T}}[d_T(u,v)/d_G(u,v)]$ is bounded by $\tilde{O}(\log n)$. Our result is obtained via a new approach of building ``highways'' between portals and a new strong diameter probabilistic decomposition theorem. 
0808.02018	Shear viscosity in neutron star cores	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:P.S. Shternin (1), D.G. Yakovlev (1) ((1) Ioffe Institute)    	Abstract:  We calculate the shear viscosity $η= η_{eμ}+η_{n}$ in a neutron star core composed of nucleons, electrons and muons ($η_{eμ}$ being the electron-muon viscosity, mediated by collisions of electrons and muons with charged particles, and $η_{n}$ the neutron viscosity, mediated by neutron-neutron and neutron-proton collisions). Deriving $η_{eμ}$, we take into account the Landau damping in collisions of electrons and muons with charged particles via the exchange of transverse plasmons. It lowers $η_{eμ}$ and leads to the non-standard temperature behavior $η_{eμ}\propto T^{-5/3}$. The viscosity $η_{n}$ is calculated taking into account that in-medium effects modify nucleon effective masses in dense matter. Both viscosities, $η_{eμ}$ and $η_{n}$, can be important, and both are calculated including the effects of proton superfluidity. They are presented in the form valid for any equation of state of nucleon dense matter. We analyze the density and temperature dependence of $η$ for different equations of state in neutron star cores, and compare $η$ with the bulk viscosity in the core and with the shear viscosity in the crust. 
0808.02019	Relaxation of Terrace-width Distributions: Physical Information from Fokker-Planck Time	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Ajmi BH. Hamouda, Alberto Pimpinelli, T. L. Einstein	Abstract:  Recently some of us have constructed a Fokker-Planck formalism to describe the equilibration of the terrace-width distribution of a vicinal surface from an arbitrary initial configuration. However, the meaning of the associated relaxation time, related to the strength of the random noise in the underlying Langevin equation, was rather unclear. Here we present a set of careful kinetic Monte Carlo simulations that demonstrate convincingly that the time constant shows activated behavior with a barrier that has a physically plausible dependence on the energies of the governing microscopic model. Furthermore, the Fokker-Planck time at least semiquantitatively tracks the actual physical time. 
0808.02020	Exclusive J/psi photoproduction in pp and ppbar collisions	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Anna Rybarska, Wolfgang Schäfer, Antoni Szczurek	Abstract:  We report on a detailed investigation of exclusive J/psi production in proton--proton and proton-antiproton collisions. Predictions for Tevatron and LHC energies are included. 
0808.02021	Time-dependent density-functional theory for electronic excitations in materials: basics and perspectives	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:C. A. Ullrich, V. Turkowski	Abstract:  Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is widely used to describe electronic excitations in complex finite systems with large numbers of atoms, such as biomolecules and nanocrystals. The first part of this paper will give a simple and pedagogical explanation, using a two-level system, which shows how the basic TDDFT formalism for excitation energies works. There is currently an intense effort underway to develop TDDFT methodologies for the charge and spin dynamics in extended systems, to calculate optical properties of bulk and nanostructured materials, and to study transport through molecular junctions. The second part of this paper highlights some challenges and recent advances of TDDFT in these areas. Two examples are discussed: excitonic effects in insulators and intersubband plasmon excitations in doped semiconductor quantum wells. 
0808.02022	Scattering configuration spaces	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Richard Melrose, Michael Singer	Abstract:  For a compact manifold with boundary $X$ we introduce the $n$-fold scattering stretched product $X^n_{\text{sc}}$ which is a compact manifold with corners for each $n,$ coinciding with the previously known cases for $n=2,3.$ It is constructed by iterated blow up of boundary faces and boundary faces of multi-diagonals in $X^n.$ The resulting space is shown to map smoothly, by a b-fibration, covering the usual projection, to the lower stretched products. It is anticipated that this manifold with corners, or at least its combinatorial structure, is a universal model for phenomena on asymptotically flat manifolds in which particle clusters emerge at infinity. In particular this is the case for magnetic monopoles on $\mathbb{R}^3$ in which case these spaces are closely related to compactifications of the moduli spaces with the boundary faces mapping to lower charge idealized moduli spaces. 
0808.02023	Regular induced subgraphs of a random graph	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Michael Krivelevich, Benny Sudakov, Nicholas Wormald	Abstract:  An old problem of Erdős, Fajtlowicz and Staton asks for the order of a largest induced regular subgraph that can be found in every graph on n vertices. Motivated by this problem, we consider the order of such a subgraph in a typical graph on n vertices, i.e., in a binomial random graph G(n,1/2). We prove that with high probability a largest induced regular subgraph of G(n,1/2) has about n^{2/3} vertices. 
0808.02024	On asymptotic stability of standing waves of discrete Schrödinger equation in $\Bbb Z$	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Scipio Cuccagna, Mirko Tarulli	Abstract:  We prove an analogue of a classical asymptotic stability result of standing waves of the Schrödinger equation originating in work by Soffer and Weinstein. Specifically, our result is a transposition on the lattice Z of a result by Mizumachi and it involves a discrete Schrödinger operator H. The decay rates on the potential are less stringent than in Mizumachi, since we require for the potential $q\in \ell ^{1,1}$. We also prove $|e^{itH}(n,m)|\le C < t > ^{-1/3}$ for a fixed $C$ requiring, in analogy to Goldberg and Schlag only $q\in \ell ^{1,1}$ if $H$ has no resonances and $q\in \ell ^{1,2}$ if it has resonances. In this way we ease the hypotheses on H contained in Pelinovsky and Stefanov, which have a similar dispersion estimate. 
0808.02025	Effective Field Equations of Brane-Induced Electromagnetism	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:F. Dahia, C. Romero, M. A. S. Cruz	Abstract:  Using a covariant embedding formalism, we find the effective field equations for the Electromagnetism that emerge on branes in the context of Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld scenario. Our treatment is essentially geometrical. We start with Maxwell equations in five-dimensions and project them into an arbitrary brane. The formalism is quite general and allows us to consider curved bulk spaces and curved branes whose tension is not necessarily null. The kinetic electromagnetic term induced on the world volume of the brane, proper of DGP models, is incorporated in this formulation by means of an appropriate match condition. We also give an estimate of each term of the effective field equations and determine the domain in which the four-dimensional Maxwell equations can be recovered in the brane. 
0808.02026	Possible re-entrant superconductivity in EuFe2As2 under pressure	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:C. F. Miclea, M. Nicklas, H. S. Jeevan, D. Kasinathan, Z. Hossain, H. Rosner, P. Gegenwart, C. Geibel, F. Steglich	Abstract:  We studied the temperature-pressure phase diagram of EuFe2As2 by measurements of the electrical resistivity. The antiferromagnetic spin-density-wave transition at T_0 associated with the FeAs-layers is continuously suppressed with increasing pressure, while the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature of the Eu 2+ moments seems to be nearly pressure independent up to 2.6 GPa. Above 2 GPa a sharp drop of the resistivity, ρ(T), indicates the onset of superconductivity at T_c \approx 29.5 K. Surprisingly, on further reducing the temperature ρ(T) is increasing again and exhibiting a maximum caused by the ordering of the Eu 2+ moments, a behavior which is reminiscent of re-entrant superconductivity as it is observed in the ternary Chevrel phases or in the rare-earth nickel borocarbides. 
0808.02027	Efficient computation of resonance varieties via Grassmannians	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:P. Lima-Filho, H. Schenck	Abstract:  Associated to the cohomology ring A of the complement X(A) of a hyperplane arrangement A in complex m-space are the resonance varieties R^k(A). The most studied of these is R^1(A), which is the union of the tangent cones at the origin to the characteristic varieties of the fundamental group of X. R^1(A) may be described in terms of Fitting ideals, or as the locus where a certain Ext module is supported. Both these descriptions give obvious algorithms for computation. In this note, we show that interpreting R^1(A) as the locus of decomposable two-tensors in the Orlik-Solomon ideal leads to a description of R^1(A) as the intersection of a Grassmannian with a linear space, determined by the quadratic generators of the Orlik-Solomon ideal. This method is much faster than previous alternatives. 
0808.02028	Eigenvalues Estimates for the p-Laplace Operator on Manifolds	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Barnabe P. Lima, J. Fabio Montenegro, Newton L. Santos	Abstract:  We obtain geometric estimates for the first eigenvalue and the fundamental tone of the p-laplacian on manifolds in terms of admissible vector fields. Also, we defined a new spectral invariant and we show its relation with the geometry of the manifold. 
0808.02029	Coulomb corrections in quasi-elastic scattering: tests of the effective-momentum approximation	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:J. A. Tjon (1), S. J. Wallace (2) ((1) University of Utrecht (2) University of Maryland)    	Abstract:  Coulomb corrections for quasi-elastic scattering of electrons by nuclei are calculated using eikonal distorted waves. Corrections to the lowest-order eikonal approximation are included in order to obtain accurate results. Spin-dependent eikonal phase shifts are evaluated and they yield very small corrections to the longitudinal and transverse cross sections at electron energies of 500 MeV or higher. Because of this the Rosenbluth procedure is accurate for separation of the longitudinal and transverse response functions. The effective-momentum approximation is also found to be accurate with regard to removal of the remaining Coulomb effects from the distorted waves. Calculations are presented for electron scattering from Pb and Fe nuclei at energies of 500 MeV and 800 MeV and momentum transfers q = 550 MeV/c and 900 MeV/c. 
0808.02030	Suppression of spin-torque in current perpendicular to the plane spin-valves by addition of Dy cap layers	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:S. Maat, N. Smith, M.J. Carey, J.R. Childress	Abstract:  We demonstrate that the addition of Dy capping layers in current perpendicular to the plane giant magneto-resistive spin-valves can increase the critical current density beyond which spin-torque induced instabilities are observed by about a factor of three. Current densities as high as 5e7 A/cm2 are measured provided that the electron current flows from the free to the reference layer. While Dy capped samples exhibit nonmagnetic 1/f noise, it is sufficiently small to be unimportant for read head operation at practical data rates. 
0808.02031	Piecewise polynomials on polyhedral complexes	Commutative Algebra (math.AC)	Authors:T. McDonald, H. Schenck	Abstract:  For a d-dimensional polyhedral complex P, the dimension of the space of piecewise polynomial functions (splines) on P of smoothness r and degree k is given, for k sufficiently large, by a polynomial f(P,r,k) of degree d. When d=2 and P is simplicial, Alfeld and Schumaker determined a formula for all three coefficients of f. However, in the polyhedral case, no formula is known. Using localization techniques and specialized dual graphs associated to codimension--2 linear spaces, we obtain the first three coefficients of f(P,r,k), giving a complete answer when d=2. 
0808.02032	Blocks of cyclotomic Hecke algebras and Khovanov-Lauda algebras	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Jonathan Brundan, Alexander Kleshchev	Abstract:  We construct an explicit isomorphism between blocks of cyclotomic Hecke algebras and (sign-modified) Khovanov-Lauda algebras in type A. These isomorphisms connect the categorification conjecture of Khovanov and Lauda to Ariki's categorification theorem. The Khovanov-Lauda algebras are naturally graded, which allows us to exhibit a non-trivial Z-grading on blocks of cyclotomic Hecke algebras, including symmetric groups in positive characteristic. 
0808.02033	Proton-Rich Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:I. R. Seitenzahl, F. X. Timmes, A. Marin-Laflèche, E. Brown, G. Magkotsios, J. Truran	Abstract:  Proton-rich material in a state of nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) is one of the least studied regimes of nucleosynthesis. One reason for this is that after hydrogen burning, stellar evolution proceeds at conditions of equal number of neutrons and protons or at a slight degree of neutron-richness. Proton-rich nucleosynthesis in stars tends to occur only when hydrogen-rich material that accretes onto a white dwarf or neutron star explodes, or when neutrino interactions in the winds from a nascent proto-neutron star or collapsar-disk drive the matter proton-rich prior to or during the nucleosynthesis. In this paper we solve the NSE equations for a range of proton-rich thermodynamic conditions. We show that cold proton-rich NSE is qualitatively different from neutron-rich NSE. Instead of being dominated by the Fe-peak nuclei with the largest binding energy per nucleon that have a proton to nucleon ratio close to the prescribed electron fraction, NSE for proton-rich material near freeze-out temperature is mainly composed of Ni56 and free protons. Previous results of nuclear reaction network calculations rely on this non-intuitive high proton abundance, which this paper will explain. We show how the differences and especially the large fraction of free protons arises from the minimization of the free energy as a result of a delicate competition between the entropy and the nuclear binding energy. 
0808.02034	X-ray pulsars through the eyes of INTEGRAL	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Lutovinov (1), S. Tsygankov (1 and 2) ((1) Space Research Institute, Moscow, Russia, (2) Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics, Garching, Germany)    	Abstract:  Recent results of the spectral and timing analysis of X-ray pulsars in hard X-rays with the INTEGRAL observatory are reviewed. The evolution of the cyclotron line energy with the source luminosity was studied in detail for the first time for several sources. It was shown that for V0332+53 this dependence is linear, but for 4U0115+63 and A0535+262 it is more complicated. There are some evidences of the "reverse" evolution for GX301-2 and Her X-1, and no evolution was found for Vela X-1, Cen X-3, etc. A strong dependence of the pulse fraction on the energy and source luminosity was revealed and studied in detail. A prominent feature in the pulse fraction dependence on the energy was discovered near the cyclotron frequency for several bright sources. The obtained results are compared with results of observations in standard X-rays and briefly discussed in terms of current models; some preliminary explanations are proposed. 
0808.02035	Inductive Analysis on Singular Minimal Hypersurfaces	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Joachim Lohkamp	Abstract:  The present paper describes a way to relate Martin boundaries on spaces of varying topology. This enables us to approach some detailed inductive analysis of the eigenfunctions of conformal Laplacians on minimal hypersurfaces near their singularities. This can directly be used resp. translated to understand the way how such minimal hypersurfaces inherit positive scalar curvature from their ambience resp. how to smooth singular minimal hypersurfaces to regular hypersurfaces with positive mean curvature. 
0808.02036	Pseudo-nonstationarity in the scaling exponents of finite interval time series	Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)	Authors:K. H. Kiyani, S. C. Chapman, N. W. Watkins	Abstract:  The accurate estimation of scaling exponents is central in the observational study of scale-invariant phenomena. Natural systems unavoidably provide observations over restricted intervals; consequently a stationary stochastic process (time series) can yield anomalous time variation in the scaling exponents, suggestive of non-stationarity. The variance in the estimates of scaling exponents computed from an interval of N observations is known for finite variance processes to vary as ~1/N as N goes to infinity for certain statistical estimators; however, the convergence to this behaviour will depend on the details of the process, and may be slow. We study the variation in the scaling of second order moments of the time series increments with N, for a variety of synthetic and `real world' time series; and find that in particular for heavy tailed processes, for realizable N, one is far from this 1/N limiting behaviour. We propose a semi-empirical estimate for the minimum N needed to make a meaningful estimate of the scaling exponents for model stochastic processes and compare these with some `real world' time series. 
0808.02037	Weak* continuous states on Banach algebras	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Bojan Magajna	Abstract:  We prove that if a unital Banach algebra $A$ is the dual of a Banach space $\pd{A}$, then the set of weak* continuous states is weak* dense in the set of all states on $A$. Further, weak* continuous states linearly span $\pd{A}$. 
0808.02038	Resonant nonlinear optics of backward waves in negative-index metamaterials	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Alexander K. Popov, Sergei A. Myslivets, Vladimir M. Shalaev	Abstract:  The extraordinary properties of resonant four-wave mixing of backward waves in doped negative-index materials are investigated. The feasibility of independent engineering of negative refractive index and nonlinear optical response as well as quantum control of the nonlinear propagation process in such composites is shown due to the coherent energy transfer from the control to the signal field. Laser-induced transparency, quantum switching, frequency-tunable narrow-band filtering, amplification, and realizing a miniature mirrorless optical parametric generator of the entangled backward and ordinary waves are among the possible applications of the investigated processes. 
0808.02039	Magnetic field measurements of O stars with FORS1 at the VLT	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Hubrig, M. Schoeller, R.S. Schnerr, J.F. Gonzalez, R. Ignace, H.F. Henrichs	Abstract:  The presence of magnetic fields in O-type stars has been suspected for a long time. The discovery of such fields would explain a wide range of well documented enigmatic phenomena in massive stars, in particular cyclical wind variability, H alpha emission variations, chemical peculiarity, narrow X-ray emission lines and non-thermal radio/X-ray emission. To investigate the incidence of magnetic fields in O stars, we acquired 38 new spectropolarimetric observations with FORS1 (FOcal Reducer low dispersion Spectrograph) mounted on the 8-m Kueyen telescope of the VLT. Spectropolarimetric observations have been obtained at different phases for a sample of 13 O stars. 10 stars were observed in the spectral range 348-589nm, HD36879 and HD148937 were observed in the spectral region 325-621nm, and HD155806 was observed in both settings. To prove the feasibility of the FORS1 spectropolarimetric mode for the measurements of magnetic fields in hot stars, we present in addition 12 FORS1 observations of the mean longitudinal magnetic field in theta^1 Ori C and compare them with measurements obtained with the MuSiCoS, ESPaDOnS and Narval spectropolarimeters. Most stars in our sample which have been observed on different nights show a change of the magnetic field polarity, but a field at a significance level of 3sigma has been detected only in four stars, HD36879, HD148937, HD152408, and HD164794. The largest longitudinal magnetic field, <B_z> = -276+-88G, was detected in the Of?p star HD148937. We conclude that large-scale organised magnetic fields with polar field strengths larger than 1kG are not widespread among O-type stars.

0808.02042	Counting Wobbling Dual-Giants	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Sujay K. Ashok, Nemani V. Suryanarayana	Abstract:  We derive the BPS equations for D3-branes embedded in AdS_5 X S^5 that preserve at least two supercharges. These are given in terms of conditions on the pullbacks of some space-time differential four-forms. Solutions to our equations are shown to describe all the known giant and dual-giant gravitons in AdS_5 X S^5. We then argue that the configuration spaces of dual-giants can be mapped to non-compact hyperbolic versions of complex projective spaces, in contrast with the giants, whose configuration spaces have been mapped to complex projective spaces. We quantize the configuration space of the 1/8-BPS dual-giants with two angular momenta in AdS_5 and one angular momentum in S^5 and find agreement with the partition function in the literature obtained both from counting appropriate 1/8-BPS configurations of giants and the boundary gauge theory considerations. 
0808.02043	On the low-energy behavior of the Adler function	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:A.V. Nesterenko	Abstract:  The infrared behavior of the Adler function is examined by making use of a recently derived integral representation for the latter. The obtained result for the Adler function agrees with its experimental prediction in the entire energy range. The inclusive $τ$ lepton decay is studied in the framework of the developed approach. 
0808.02044	Supersymmetry beyond minimal flavour violation	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Sebastian Jager	Abstract:  We review the sources and phenomenology of non-minimal flavour violation in the MSSM. We discuss in some detail the most important theoretical and experimental constraints, as well as promising observables to look for supersymmetric effects at the LHC and in the future. We emphasize the sensitivity of flavour physics to the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking and to new degrees of freedom present at fundamental scales, such as the grand unification scale. We include a discussion of present data that may hint at departures from the Standard Model. 
0808.02045	Correctness is not enough	Software Engineering (cs.SE)	Authors:Louise Pryor	Abstract:  The usual aim of spreadsheet audit is to verify correctness. There are two problems with this: first, it is often difficult to tell whether the spreadsheets in question are correct, and second, even if they are, they may still give the wrong results. These problems are explained in this paper, which presents the key criteria for judging a spreadsheet and discusses how those criteria can be achieved 
0808.02046	Symmetries in collective neutrino oscillations	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Huaiyu Duan, George M. Fuller, Yong-Zhong Qian	Abstract:  We discuss the relationship between a symmetry in the neutrino flavour evolution equations and neutrino flavour oscillations in the collective precession mode. This collective precession mode can give rise to spectral swaps (splits) when conditions can be approximated as homogeneous and isotropic. Multi-angle numerical simulations of supernova neutrino flavour transformation show that when this approximation breaks down, non-collective neutrino oscillation modes decohere kinematically, but the collective precession mode still is expected to stand out. We provide a criterion for significant flavour transformation to occur if neutrinos participate in a collective precession mode. This criterion can be used to understand the suppression of collective neutrino oscillations in anisotropic environments in the presence of a high matter density. This criterion is also useful in understanding the breakdown of the collective precession mode when neutrino densities are small. 
0808.02047	Gauging the cosmic microwave background	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. P. Zibin, Douglas Scott	Abstract:  We provide a new derivation of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and find an exact expression that can be readily expanded perturbatively. Close attention is paid to gauge issues, with the motivation to examine the effect of super-Hubble modes on the CMB. We calculate a transfer function that encodes the behaviour of the dipole, and examine its long-wavelength behaviour. We show that contributions to the dipole from adiabatic super-Hubble modes are strongly suppressed, even in the presence of a cosmological constant, contrary to claims in the literature. We also introduce a naturally defined CMB monopole, which exhibits closely analogous long-wavelength behaviour. We discuss the geometrical origin of this super-Hubble suppression, pointing out that it is a simple reflection of adiabaticity, and hence argue that it will occur regardless of the matter content. 
0808.02048	Effective Viscosity of a Dilute Suspension of Membrane-bound Inclusions	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Mark L. Henle, Alex J. Levine	Abstract:  When particulate suspensions are sheared, perturbations in the shear flows around the rigid particles increase the local energy dissipation, so that the viscosity of the suspension is effectively higher than that of the solvent. For bulk (three-dimensional) fluids, understanding this viscosity enhancement is a classic problem in hydrodynamics that originated over a century ago with Einstein's study of a dilute suspension of spherical particles. \cite{Einstein1} In this paper, we investigate the analogous problem of the effective viscosity of a suspension of disks embedded in a two-dimensional membrane or interface. Unlike the hydrodynamics of bulk fluids, low-Reynolds number membrane hydrodynamics is characterized by an inherent length scale generated by the coupling of the membrane to the bulk fluids that surround it. As a result, we find that the size of the particles in the suspension relative to this hydrodynamic length scale has a dramatic effect on the effective viscosity of the suspension. Our study also helps to elucidate the mathematical tools needed to solve the mixed boundary value problems that generically arise when considering the motion of rigid inclusions in fluid membranes. 
0808.02049	Measurement of the dark matter velocity anisotropy in galaxy clusters	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ole Host, Steen H. Hansen, Rocco Piffaretti, Andrea Morandi, Stefano Ettori, Scott T. Kay, Riccardo Valdarnini	Abstract:  The internal dynamics of a dark matter structure may have the remarkable property that the local temperature in the structure depends on direction. This is parametrized by the velocity anisotropy beta which must be zero for relaxed collisional structures, but has been shown to be non-zero in numerical simulations of dark matter structures. Here we present a method to infer the radial profile of the velocity anisotropy of the dark matter halo in a galaxy cluster from X-ray observables of the intracluster gas. This non-parametric method is based on a universal relation between the dark matter temperature and the gas temperature which is confirmed through numerical simulations. We apply this method to observational data and we find that beta is significantly different from zero at intermediate radii. Thus we find a strong indication that dark matter is effectively collisionless on the dynamical time-scale of clusters, which implies an upper limit on the self-interaction cross-section per unit mass sigma/m < 1 cm2/g. Our results may provide an independent way to determine the stellar mass density in the central regions of a relaxed cluster, as well as a test of whether a cluster is in fact relaxed. 
0808.02050	Search for Gravitational Wave Bursts from Soft Gamma Repeaters	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:LIGO Scientific Collaboration, S. Barthelmy, N. Gehrels, K. C. Hurley, D. Palmer	Abstract:  We present the results of a LIGO search for short-duration gravitational waves (GWs) associated with Soft Gamma Repeater (SGR) bursts. This is the first search sensitive to neutron star f-modes, usually considered the most efficient GW emitting modes. We find no evidence of GWs associated with any SGR burst in a sample consisting of the 27 Dec. 2004 giant flare from SGR 1806-20 and 190 lesser events from SGR 1806-20 and SGR 1900+14 which occurred during the first year of LIGO's fifth science run. GW strain upper limits and model-dependent GW emission energy upper limits are estimated for individual bursts using a variety of simulated waveforms. The unprecedented sensitivity of the detectors allows us to set the most stringent limits on transient GW amplitudes published to date. We find upper limit estimates on the model-dependent isotropic GW emission energies (at a nominal distance of 10 kpc) between 3x10^45 and 9x10^52 erg depending on waveform type, detector antenna factors and noise characteristics at the time of the burst. These upper limits are within the theoretically predicted range of some SGR models.

Alcock, T. Axelrod, Y.-I. Byun, W.-P. Chen, K. H. Cook, R. Dave, I. de Pater, R. Porrata, D.-W. Kim, S.-K. King, T. Lee, H.-C. Lin, J. J. Lissauer, S. L. Marshall, P. Protopapas, J. A. Rice, M. E. Schwamb, S.-Y. Wang, C.-Y. Wen	Abstract:  Results from the first two years of data from the Taiwanese-American Occultation Survey (TAOS) are presented. Stars have been monitored photometrically at 4 Hz or 5 Hz to search for occultations by small (~3 km) Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs). No statistically significant events were found, allowing us to present an upper bound to the size distribution of KBOs with diameters 0.5 km < D < 28 km. 
0808.02052	Low-scale gaugino mediation, lots of leptons at the LHC	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Andrea De Simone, JiJi Fan, Martin Schmaltz, Witold Skiba	Abstract:  Low-scale gaugino mediation predicts that gauginos are significantly heavier than scalar superpartners. In order of increasing mass the lightest superpartners are the gravitino, right-handed sleptons and left-handed sleptons (no light neutralino!). This implies that squark decay chains pass through one or more sleptons and typical final states from squark and gluino production at the LHC include multiple leptons. In addition, left-handed staus have large branching fractions into right-handed staus and the Higgs. As an example, we compute the spectrum of low-scale deconstructed gaugino mediation. In this model gauginos acquire masses at tree level at 5 TeV while scalar masses are generated radiatively from the gaugino masses. 
0808.02053	Spitzer's mid-infrared view on an outer Galaxy Infrared Dark Cloud candidate toward NGC 7538	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:W. F. Frieswijk, M. Spaans, R. F. Shipman, D. Teyssier, S. J. Carey, A. G. G. M. Tielens	Abstract:  Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) represent the earliest observed stages of clustered star formation, characterized by large column densities of cold and dense molecular material observed in silhouette against a bright background of mid-IR emission. Up to now, IRDCs were predominantly known toward the inner Galaxy where background infrared emission levels are high. We present Spitzer observations with the Infrared Camera Array toward object G111.80+0.58 (G111) in the outer Galactic Plane, located at a distance of ~3 kpc from us and ~10 kpc from the Galactic center. Earlier results show that G111 is a massive, cold molecular clump very similar to IRDCs. The mid-IR Spitzer observations unambiguously detect object G111 in absorption. We have identified for the first time an IRDC in the outer Galaxy, which confirms the suggestion that cluster-forming clumps are present throughout the Galactic Plane. However, against a low mid-IR back ground such as the outer Galaxy it takes some effort to find them. 
0808.02054	Dual Gravitons in AdS4/CFT3 and the Holographic Cotton Tensor	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Sebastian de Haro	Abstract:  We argue that gravity theories in AdS4 are holographically dual to either of two three-dimensional CFT's: the usual Dirichlet CFT1 where the fixed graviton acts as a source for the stress-energy tensor, and a dual CFT2 with a fixed dual graviton which acts as a source for a dual stress-energy tensor. The dual stress-energy tensor is shown to be the Cotton tensor of the Dirichlet CFT. The two CFT's are related by a Legendre transformation generated by a gravitational Chern-Simons coupling. This duality is a gravitational version of electric-magnetic duality valid at any radius r, where the renormalized stress-energy tensor is the electric field and the Cotton tensor is the magnetic field. Generic Robin boundary conditions lead to CFT's coupled to Cotton gravity or topologically massive gravity. Interaction terms with CFT1 lead to a non-zero vev of the stress-energy tensor in CFT2 coupled to gravity even after the source is removed. We point out that the dual graviton also exists beyond the linearized approximation, and spell out some of the details of the non-linear construction. 
0808.02055	The hierarchy problem, radion mass, localization of gravity and 4D effective Newtonian potential in string theory on $S^{1}/Z_{2}$	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Anzhong Wang, N.O. Santos	Abstract:  We present a systematical study of brane worlds in string theory on $S^{1}/Z_{2}$. Starting with the toroidal compactification of the NS/NS sector in (D+d) dimensions, we first obtain an effective $D$-dimensional action, and then compactify one of the $(D-1)$ spatial dimensions by introducing two orbifold branes as its boundaries. By combining the Gauss-Codacci and Lanczos equations, we write down explicitly the general gravitational field equations on each of the two branes, while using distribution theory we express the matter field equations on the branes in terms of the discontinuities of the first derivatives of the matter fields. Afterwards, we address three important issues: (i) the hierarchy problem; (ii) the radion mass; and (iii) the localization of gravity, the 4-dimensional Newtonian effective potential and the Yukawa corrections due to the gravitational high-order Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes. With a very conservative estimation, we find that the radion mass is of the order of $10^{-2} GeV$. The gravity is localized on the visible brane, and the spectrum of the gravitational KK modes is discrete and can be of the order of TeV. The corrections to the 4-dimensional Newtonian potential from the higher order of gravitational KK modes are exponentially suppressed and can be safely neglected in current experiments. In an appendix, we also present a systematical and pedagogical study of the Gauss-Codacci equations and Israel's junction conditions across a (D-1)-dimensional hypersurface, which can be either spacelike or timelike.

Sharpe (Univ. Washington)    	Abstract:  We reply to Creutz's comments on our paper " 't Hooft vertices, partial quenching, and rooted staggered QCD." We show that his criticisms are incorrect and result from a misunderstanding both of our work, and of the related work of Adams. 
0808.02057	Weighing matrices and optical quantum computing	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Steven T. Flammia, Simone Severini	Abstract:  Quantum computation in the one-way model requires the preparation of certain resource states known as cluster states. We describe how the construction of continuous-variable cluster states for optical quantum computing relate to the existence of certain families of matrices. The relevant matrices are known as weighing matrices, with a few additional constraints. We prove some results regarding the structure of these matrices, and their associated graphs. 
0808.02058	Successful Leptogenesis in SO(10) Unification with a Left-Right Symmetric Seesaw Mechanism	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Asmaa Abada, Pierre Hosteins, Francois-Xavier Josse-Michaux, Stephane Lavignac	Abstract:  We study thermal leptogenesis in a broad class of supersymmetric SO(10) models with a left-right symmetric seesaw mechanism, taking into account flavour effects and the contribution of the next-to-lightest right-handed neutrino supermultiplet. Assuming M_D = M_u and a normal hierarchy of light neutrino masses, we show that four out of the eight right-handed neutrino mass spectra reconstructed from low-energy neutrino data can lead to successful leptogenesis with a reheating temperature in the (10^9 - 10^10) GeV range. In the remaining four solutions, leptogenesis is dominated by N_2 decays, as in the type I seesaw case. We find that some of these spectra can generate the observed baryon asymmetry for reheating temperatures above 10^10 GeV, in contrast to the type I case. Together with flavour effects, an accurate description of charged fermion masses turns out to be a crucial ingredient in the analysis. 
0808.02059	Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoffs in MIMO Relay Channels	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Deniz Gunduz, Andrea Goldsmith, H. Vincent Poor	Abstract:  A multi-hop relay channel with multiple antenna terminals in a quasi-static slow fading environment is considered. For both full-duplex and half-duplex relays the fundamental diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) is analyzed. It is shown that, while decode-and-forward (DF) relaying achieves the optimal DMT in the full-duplex relay scenario, the dynamic decode-and-forward (DDF) protocol is needed to achieve the optimal DMT if the relay is constrained to half-duplex operation. For the latter case, static protocols are considered as well, and the corresponding achievable DMT performance is characterized. 
0808.02060	Constraining the D3-brane effective action	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Anirban Basu	Abstract:  We consider higher derivative corrections of the type D^{2k} R^2 in the effective action of the D3-brane with trivial normal bundle. Based on the perturbative disc and annulus amplitudes, and constraints of supersymmetry and duality, we argue that these interactions are protected, at least for small values of k. Their coefficient functions receive only a finite number of perturbative contributions, and non-perturbative contributions from D-instantons. We propose expressions for these modular forms for low values of k. 
0808.02061	Does The Addition of a Duration Improve the L_iso - E_peak Relation For Gamma-Ray Bursts?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Andrew C. Collazzi, Bradley E. Schaefer	Abstract:  Firmani et al. proposed a new Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) luminosity relation that showed a significant improvement over the L_iso-E_peak relation. The new proposed relation simply modifies the E_peak value by multiplying it by a power of T_0.45, where T_0.45 is a particular measure of the GRB duration. We begin by reproducing the results of Firmani for his 19 bursts. We then test the Firmani relation for the same 19 bursts except that we use independently measured values for L_iso, T_0.45, and E_peak, and we find that the relation deteriorates substantially. We further test the relation by using 60 GRBs with measured spectroscopic redshifts, and find a relation that has a comparable scatter as the original L_iso-E_peak relation. That is, a much larger sample of bursts does not reproduce the small scatter as reported by Firmani et al. Finally, we investigate whether the Firmani relation is improved by the use of any of 32 measures of duration in place of T_0.45. The quality of each alternative duration measure is evaluated with the root mean square of the scatter between the observed and fitted logarithmic Liso values. Although we find some durations yield slightly better results than T_0.45, the differences between the duration measures are minimal. We find that the addition of a duration does not add any significant improvement to the L_iso-E_peak relation. We also present a simple and direct derivation of the Firmani relation from both the L_iso-E_peak and Amati relations. In all we conclude that the Firmani relation neither has an independent existence nor does it provide any significant improvement on previously known relations that are simpler. 
0808.02062	Hyperbolic conservation laws on the sphere. A geometry-compatible finite volume scheme	Numerical Analysis (math.NA)	Authors:Matania Ben-Artzi, Joseph Falcovitz, Philippe G. LeFloch	Abstract:  We consider entropy solutions to the initial value problem associated with scalar nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws posed on the two-dimensional sphere. We propose a finite volume scheme which relies on a web-like mesh made of segments of longitude and latitude lines. The structure of the mesh allows for a discrete version of a natural geometric compatibility condition, which arose earlier in the well-posedness theory established by Ben-Artzi and LeFloch. We study here several classes of flux vectors which define the conservation law under consideration. They are based on prescribing a suitable vector field in the Euclidean three-dimensional space and then suitably projecting it on the sphere's tangent plane; even when the flux vector in the ambient space is constant, the corresponding flux vector is a non-trivial vector field on the sphere. In particular, we construct here "equatorial periodic solutions", analogous to one-dimensional periodic solutions to one-dimensional conservation laws, as well as a wide variety of stationary (steady state) solutions. We also construct "confined solutions", which are time-dependent solutions supported in an arbitrarily specified subdomain of the sphere. Finally, representative numerical examples and test-cases are presented. 
0808.02063	Constraining Gravitational and Cosmological Parameters with Astrophysical Data	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yi Mao (MIT)    	Abstract:  We use astrophysical data to shed light on fundamental physics by constraining parametrized theoretical cosmological and gravitational models. Gravitational parameters are those constants that parametrize possible departures from Einstein's general theory of relativity. We develop a general framework to describe torsion in the spacetime around the Earth, and show that certain observables of the Gravity Probe B experiment can be computed in this framework. We also search for viable theories of gravity where the Ricci scalar R in the Lagrangian is replaced by an arbitrary function f(R). Making use of the equivalence between such theories and scalar-tensor gravity, we find that models can be made consistent with solar system constraints either by giving the scalar a high mass or by exploiting the so-called Chameleon Effect. Cosmology can successfully describe the evolution of our universe using six or more adjustable cosmological parameters. There is growing interest in using 3-dimensional neutral hydrogen mapping with the redshifted 21 cm line as a cosmological probe. We quantify how the precision with which cosmological parameters can be measured depends on a broad range of assumptions. We present an accurate and robust method for measuring cosmological parameters that exploits the fact that the ionization power spectra are rather smooth functions that can be accurately fit by 7 phenomenological parameters. We find that a future square kilometer array optimized for 21 cm tomography could have great potential, improving the sensitivity to spatial curvature and neutrino masses by up to two orders of magnitude, to Delta-Omega_k ~ 0.0002 and Delta-m_nu ~ 0.007 eV, and giving a 4 sigma detection of the spectral index running predicted by the simplest inflation models. 
0808.02064	Lubrication approximation for micro-particles moving along parallel walls	Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)	Authors:M. L. Ekiel-Jezewska, E. Wajnryb, J. Blawzdziewicz, F. Feuillebois	Abstract:  Lubrication expressions for the friction coefficients of a spherical particle moving in a fluid between and along two parallel solid walls are explicitly evaluated in the low-Reynolds-number regime. They are used to determine lubrication expression for the particle free motion under an ambient Poiseuille flow. The range of validity and the accuracy of the lubrication approximation is determined by comparing with the corresponding results of the accurate multipole procedure. The results are applicable for thin, wide and long microchannels, or quasi-two-dimensional systems. 
0808.02065	Why many theories of shock waves are necessary. Convergence error in formally path-consistent schemes	Numerical Analysis (math.NA)	Authors:Manuel J. Castro, Philippe G. LeFloch, María Luz Muñoz-Ruiz, Carlos Parés	Abstract:  We are interested in nonlinear hyperbolic systems in nonconservative form arising in fluid dynamics, and, for solutions containing shock waves, we investigate the convergence of finite difference schemes applied to such systems. According to Dal Maso, LeFloch, and Murat's theory, a shock wave theory for a given nonconservative system requires prescribing a priori a family of paths in the phase space. In the present paper, we consider schemes that are formally consistent with a given family of paths, and we investigate their limiting behavior as the mesh is refined. We generalize to systems a property established earlier by Hou and LeFloch for scalar conservation laws, and we prove that nonconservative schemes generate, at the level of the limiting hyperbolic system, a "convergence error" source-term which, provided the total variation of the approximations remains uniformly bounded, is a locally bounded measure. We discuss the role of the equivalent equation associated with a difference scheme; here, the distinction between scalar equations and systems appears most clearly since, for systems, the equivalent equation of a scheme that is formally path-consistent depends upon the prescribed family of paths. The core of this paper is devoted to investigate numerically the approximation of several models arising in fluid dynamics. For systems having nonconservative products associated with linearly degenerate characteristic fields, the convergence error vanishes. For some other models, this measure is evaluated very accurately, especially by plotting the shock curves associated with each scheme under consideration. 
0808.02066	Seiberg--Witten maps for $\boldsymbol{SO(1,3)}$ gauge invariance and deformations of gravity	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:S. Marculescu, F. Ruiz Ruiz	Abstract:  A family of diffeomorphism-invariant Seiberg--Witten deformations of gravity is constructed. In a first step Seiberg--Witten maps for an SO(1,3) gauge symmetry are obtained for constant deformation parameters. This includes maps for the vierbein, the spin connection and the Einstein--Hilbert Lagrangian. In a second step the vierbein postulate is imposed in normal coordinates and the deformation parameters are identified with the components $θ^{μν}(x)$ of a covariantly constant bivector. This procedure gives for the classical action a power series in the bivector components which by construction is diffeomorphism-invariant. Explicit contributions up to second order are obtained. For completeness a cosmological constant term is included in the analysis. Covariant constancy of $ θ^{μν}(x) $, together with the field equations, imply that, up to second order, only four-dimensional metrics which are direct sums of two two-dimensional metrics are admissible, the two-dimensional curvatures being expressed in terms of $θ^{μν}$. These four-dimensional metrics can be viewed as a family of deformed emergent gravities. 
0808.02067	Biexcitons in two-dimensional systems with spatially separated electrons and holes	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:A. D. Meyertholen, M. M. Fogler	Abstract:  The binding energy and wavefunctions of two-dimensional indirect biexcitons are studied analytically and numerically. It is proven that stable biexcitons exist only when the distance between electron and hole layers is smaller than a certain critical threshold. Numerical results for the biexciton binding energies are obtained using the stochastic variational method and compared with the analytical asymptotics. The threshold interlayer separation and its uncertainty are estimated. The results are compared with those obtained by other techniques, in particular, the diffusion Monte-Carlo method and the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. 
0808.02068	Explicit form of the Mann-Marolf surface term in (3+1) dimensions	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Matt Visser (Victoria University of Wellington)    	Abstract:  The Mann-Marolf surface term is a specific candidate for the "reference background term" that is to be subtracted from the Gibbons-Hawking surface term in order make the total gravitational action of asymptotically flat spacetimes finite. That is, the total gravitational action is taken to be: (Einstein-Hilbert bulk term) + (Gibbons-Hawking surface term) - (Mann-Marolf surface term). As presented by Mann and Marolf, their surface term is specified implicitly in terms of the Ricci tensor of the boundary. Herein I demonstrate that for the physically interesting case of a (3+1) dimensional bulk spacetime, the Mann-Marolf surface term can be specified explicitly in terms of the Einstein tensor of the (2+1) dimensional boundary. 
0808.02069	Action and Hamiltonians in higher dimensional general relativity: First order framework	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Abhay Ashtekar, David Sloan	Abstract:  We consider $d>4$-dimensional space-times which are asymptotically flat at spatial infinity and show that, in the first order framework, the action principle is well-defined \emph{without the need of infinite counter terms.} It naturally leads to a covariant phase space in which the Hamiltonians generating asymptotic symmetries provide the total energy-momentum and angular momentum of the isolated system. This work runs parallel to our previous analysis in four dimensions \cite{aes}. The higher dimensional analysis is in fact simpler because of absence of logarithmic and super translation ambiguities. 
0808.02070	Drug delivery with carbon nanotubes for in vivo cancer treatment	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Zhuang Liu, Kai Chen, Corrine Davis, Sarah Sherlock, Qizhen Cao, Xiaoyuan Chen, Hongjie Dai	Abstract:  Chemically functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have shown promise in tumor targeted accumulation in mice and exhibit biocompatibility, excretion and little toxicity. Here, we demonstrate in-vivo SWNT drug delivery for tumor suppression in mice. We conjugate paclitaxel (PTX), a widely used cancer chemotherapy drug to branched polyethylene-glycol (PEG) chains on SWNTs via a cleavable ester bond to obtain a water soluble SWNT-paclitaxel conjugate (SWNT-PTX). SWNT-PTX affords higher efficacy in suppressing tumor growth than clinical Taxol in a murine 4T1 breast-cancer model, owing to prolonged blood circulation and 10-fold higher tumor PTX uptake by SWNT delivery likely through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR). Drug molecules carried into the reticuloendothelial system are released from SWNTs and excreted via biliary pathway without causing obvious toxic effects to normal organs. Thus, nanotube drug delivery is promising for high treatment efficacy and minimum side effects for future cancer therapy with low drug doses. 
0808.02071	A Four-site Higgsless Model with Wavefunction Mixing	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:R. Sekhar Chivukula, Elizabeth H. Simmons	Abstract:  Motivated by models of holographic technicolor, we discuss a four-site deconstructed Higgsless model with nontrivial wavefunction mixing. We compute the spectrum of the model, the electroweak triple gauge boson vertices, and, for brane-localized fermions, the electroweak parameters to O(M^2_W/M^2_rho). We discuss the conditions under which "S" vanishes (even for brane-localized fermions) and the (distinct but overlapping) conditions under which the phenomenologically interesting decay a_1 to W gamma is non-zero and suppressed by only one power of M_W/M_rho. 
0808.02072	Test of Particle-Assisted Tunneling for Strongly Interacting Fermions in an Optical Superlattice	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:T. Goodman, L.-M. Duan	Abstract:  Fermions in an optical lattice near a wide Feshbach resonance are expected to be described by an effective Hamiltonian of the general Hubbard model with particle-assisted tunneling rates resulting from the strong atomic interaction [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 243202 (2005)]. Here, we propose a scheme to unambiguously test the predictions of this effective Hamiltonian through manipulation of ultracold atoms in an inhomogeneous optical superlattice. The structure of the low-energy Hilbert space as well as the particle assisted tunneling rates can be inferred from measurements of the time-of-flight images. 
0808.02073	Lower Bounds on the Rate-Distortion Function of LDGM Codes	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:A. G. Dimakis, M. J. Wainwright, K. Ramchandran	Abstract:  A recent line of work has focused on the use of low-density generator matrix (LDGM) codes for lossy source coding. In this paper, wedevelop a generic technique for deriving lower bounds on the rate-distortion functions of binary linear codes, with particular interest on the effect of bounded degrees. The underlying ideas can be viewing as the source coding analog of the classical result of Gallager, providing bounds for channel coding over the binary symmetric channel using bounded degree LDPC codes. We illustrate this method for different random ensembles of LDGM codes, including the check-regular ensemble and bit-check-regular ensembles, by deriving explicit lower bounds on their rate-distortion performance as a function of the degrees. 
0808.02074	Limits of Binaries That Can Be Characterized by Gravitational Microlensing	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Doeon Kim, Yoon-Hyun Ryu, Byeong-Gon Park, Heon-Young Chang, Kyu-Ha Hwang, Sun-Ju Chung, Chung-Uk Lee, Cheongho Han	Abstract:  Due to the high efficiency of planet detections, current microlensing planet searches focus on high-magnification events. High-magnification events are sensitive to remote binary companions as well and thus a sample of wide-separation binaries are expected to be collected as a byproduct. In this paper, we show that characterizing binaries for a portion of this sample will be difficult due to the degeneracy of the binary-lensing parameters. This degeneracy arises because the perturbation induced by the binary companion is well approximated by the Chang-Refsdal lensing for binaries with separations greater than a certain limit. For binaries composed of equal mass lenses, we find that the lens binarity can be noticed up to the separations of $\sim 60$ times of the Einstein radius corresponding to the mass of each lens. Among these binaries, however, we find that the lensing parameters can be determined only for a portion of binaries with separations less than $\sim 20$ times of the Einstein radius. 
0808.02075	Structural effects on the spin-state transition in epitaxially strained LaCoO$_3$ films	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:James M. Rondinelli, Nicola A. Spaldin	Abstract:  Using density functional theory within the LSDA + U method, we investigate the effect of strain on the spin state and magnetic ordering in perovskite lanthanum cobaltite, LaCoO3. We show that, while strain-induced changes in lattice parameters are insufficient to stabilize a non-zero spin state, additional heteroepitaxial symmetry constraints -- in particular the suppression of octahedral rotations -- stabilize a ferromagnetic intermediate-spin state. By comparing with experimental data for the bulk material, we calculate an upper bound on the Hubbard U value, and describe the role that the on-site Coulomb interaction plays in determining the spin-state configuration. 
0808.02076	Wigner crystal physics in quantum wires	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Julia S. Meyer, K. A. Matveev	Abstract:  The physics of interacting quantum wires has attracted a lot of attention recently. When the density of electrons in the wire is very low, the strong repulsion between electrons leads to the formation of a Wigner crystal. We review the rich spin and orbital properties of the Wigner crystal, both in the one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional regime. In the one-dimensional Wigner crystal the electron spins form an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with exponentially small exchange coupling. In the presence of leads the resulting inhomogeneity of the electron density causes a violation of spin-charge separation. As a consequence the spin degrees of freedom affect the conductance of the wire. Upon increasing the electron density, the Wigner crystal starts deviating from the strictly one-dimensional geometry, forming a zigzag structure instead. Spin interactions in this regime are dominated by ring exchanges, and the phase diagram of the resulting zigzag spin chain has a number of unpolarized phases as well as regions of complete and partial spin polarization. Finally we address the orbital properties in the vicinity of the transition from a one-dimensional to a quasi-one-dimensional state. Due to the locking between chains in the zigzag Wigner crystal, only one gapless mode exists. Manifestations of Wigner crystal physics at weak interactions are explored by studying the fate of the additional gapped low-energy mode as a function of interaction strength. 
0808.02077	Bounds of concurrence and their relation with fidelity and frontier states	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Zhihao Ma, Fu-Lin Zhang, Dong-Ling Deng, Jing-Ling Chen	Abstract:  The bounds of concurrence in [F. Mintert and A. Buchleitner, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98 (2007) 140505] and [C. Zhang \textit{et. al.}, Phys. Rev. A 78 (2008) 042308] are proved by using two properties of the fidelity. In two-qubit systems, for a given value of concurrence, the states achieving the maximal upper bound, the minimal lower bound or the maximal difference upper-lower bound are determined analytically. 
0808.02078	On the application of homotopy perturbation method to differential equations	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Francisco M.

0808.02079	Localization and the Anomalous Hall Effect in a "Dirty" Metallic Ferromagnet	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:P. Mitra, N. Kumar, N. Samarth	Abstract:  We report magnetoresistance measurements over an extensive temperature range (0.1 K $\leq T \leq$ 100 K) in a disordered ferromagnetic semiconductor (\gma). The study focuses on a series of metallic \gma~ epilayers that lie in the vicinity of the metal-insulator transition ($k_F l_e\sim 1$). At low temperatures ($T < 4$ K), we first confirm the results of earlier studies that the longitudinal conductivity shows a $T^{1/3}$ dependence, consistent with quantum corrections from carrier localization in a ``dirty'' metal. In addition, we find that the anomalous Hall conductivity exhibits universal behavior in this temperature range, with no pronounced quantum corrections. We argue that observed scaling relationship between the low temperature longitudinal and transverse resistivity, taken in conjunction with the absence of quantum corrections to the anomalous Hall conductivity, is consistent with the side-jump mechanism for the anomalous Hall effect. In contrast, at high temperatures ($T \gtrsim 4$ K), neither the longitudinal nor the anomalous Hall conductivity exhibit universal behavior, indicating the dominance of inelastic scattering contributions down to liquid helium temperatures. 
0808.02080	Almost filling laminations and the connectivity of ending lamination space	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:David Gabai	Abstract:  We show that if S is a finite type orientable surface of negative Euler characteristic which is not the 3-holed sphere, 4-holed sphere or 1-holed torus, then the ending lamination space of S is connected, locally path connected and cyclic. 
0808.02081	Concurrent Imitation Dynamics in Congestion Games	Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)	Authors:Heiner Ackermann, Petra Berenbrink, Simon Fischer, Martin Hoefer	Abstract:  Imitating successful behavior is a natural and frequently applied approach to trust in when facing scenarios for which we have little or no experience upon which we can base our decision. In this paper, we consider such behavior in atomic congestion games. We propose to study concurrent imitation dynamics that emerge when each player samples another player and possibly imitates this agents' strategy if the anticipated latency gain is sufficiently large. Our main focus is on convergence properties. Using a potential function argument, we show that our dynamics converge in a monotonic fashion to stable states. In such a state none of the players can improve its latency by imitating somebody else. As our main result, we show rapid convergence to approximate equilibria. At an approximate equilibrium only a small fraction of agents sustains a latency significantly above or below average. In particular, imitation dynamics behave like fully polynomial time approximation schemes (FPTAS). Fixing all other parameters, the convergence time depends only in a logarithmic fashion on the number of agents. Since imitation processes are not innovative they cannot discover unused strategies. Furthermore, strategies may become extinct with non-zero probability. For the case of singleton games, we show that the probability of this event occurring is negligible. Additionally, we prove that the social cost of a stable state reached by our dynamics is not much worse than an optimal state in singleton congestion games with linear latency function. Finally, we discuss how the protocol can be extended such that, in the long run, dynamics converge to a Nash equilibrium. 
0808.02082	Algebraically Special, Real Alpha Geometries	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Peter R. Law, Yasuo Matsushita	Abstract:  We exploit the spinor description of four-dimensional Walker geometry, and conformal rescalings of such, to describe the local geometry of four-dimensional neutral geometries with algebraically degenerate self-dual Weyl curvature and an integrable distribution of alpha-planes (algebraically special real alpha-geometry). In particular, we determine the behaviour of (four-dimensional neutral) Walker geometry under conformal rescalings and provide a derivation of the hyperheavenly equation from conformal rescaling formulae. 
0808.02083	Histogram-Aware Sorting for Enhanced Word-Aligned Compression in Bitmap Indexes	Databases (cs.DB)	Authors:Owen Kaser, Daniel Lemire, Kamel Aouiche	Abstract:  Bitmap indexes must be compressed to reduce input/output costs and minimize CPU usage. To accelerate logical operations (AND, OR, XOR) over bitmaps, we use techniques based on run-length encoding (RLE), such as Word-Aligned Hybrid (WAH) compression. These techniques are sensitive to the order of the rows: a simple lexicographical sort can divide the index size by 9 and make indexes several times faster. We investigate reordering heuristics based on computed attribute-value histograms. Simply permuting the columns of the table based on these histograms can increase the sorting efficiency by 40%. 
0808.02084	Slow long-range decay of bound Hartree-Fock orbitals and enhancement of the exchange interaction and tunneling	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:V.V. Flambaum	Abstract:  Exchange interaction strongly influences the long-range behaviour of localised electron orbitals. It violates the oscillation theorem (creates extra nodes) and produces a power-law decay instead of the usual exponential decrease at large distances. For inner orbitals inside molecules decay is 1/r^2, for macroscopic systems cos(k_f r)/r^n, where k_f is the Fermi momentum and n=3 for 1D, n=3.5 for 2D and n=4 for 3D crystal. Slow decay increases the exchange interaction between localised spins and the under-barrier tunneling amplitude.The under-barrier transmission coefficients in solids (e.g. for point contacts) become temperature-dependent. 
0808.02085	Enhanced heating of salty water and ice under microwaves: Molecular dynamics study	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Motohiko Tanaka, Motoyasu Sato	Abstract:  By molecular dynamics simulations, we have studied the enhanced heating process of salty ice and water by the electric field of applied microwaves at 2.5 GHz, and those in the range 2.5-10 GHz for the frequency dependence. We show that water molecules in salty ice are allowed to rotate in response to the microwave electric field to the extent comparable to those in pure water, because the molecules in salty ice are loosely tied by hydrogen bonds with adjacent molecules unlike the case of rigidly bonded pure ice. The weakening of hydrogen-bonded network of molecules in salty ice is mainly caused by the electrostatic effect of salt ions rather than the short-range geometrical (atom size) effect of salt ions since the presence of salt ions with small radii results in similar enhanced heating. 
0808.02086	Abelian ideals with given dimension in Borel subalgebras	Quantum Algebra (math.QA)	Authors:Li Luo	Abstract:  A well-known Peterson's theorem says that the number of abelian ideals in a Borel subalgebra of a rank-$r$ finite dimensional simple Lie algebra is exactly $2^r$. In this paper, we determine the dimensional distribution of abelian ideals in a Borel subalgebra of finite dimensional simple Lie algebras, which is a refinement of the Peterson's theorem capturing more Lie algebra invariants. 
0808.02087	Connectivity Properties of Horospheres in Euclidean Buildings and Applications to Finiteness Properties of Discrete Groups	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Kai-Uwe Bux, Kevin Wortman	Abstract:  Let G(O_S) be an S-arithmetic subgroup of a connected, absolutely almost simple linear algebraic group G over a global function field K. We show that the sum of local ranks of G determines the homological finiteness properties of G(O_S) provided the K-rank of G is 1. This shows that the general upper bound for the finiteness length of G(O_S) established in an earlier paper is sharp in this case. The geometric analysis underlying our result determines the conectivity properties of horospheres in thick Euclidean buildings. 
0808.02088	Density estimates and concentration inequalities with Malliavin calculus	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Ivan Nourdin (University of Paris 6), Frederi G. Viens (Purdue University)    	Abstract:  We show how to use the Malliavin calculus to obtain density estimates of the law of general centered random variables. In particular, under a non-degeneracy condition, we prove and use a new formula for the density of a random variable which is measurable and differentiable with respect to a given isonormal Gaussian process. Among other results, we apply our techniques to bound the density of the maximum of a general Gaussian process from above and below; several new results ensue, including improvements on the so-called Borell-Sudakov inequality. We then explain what can be done when one is only interested in or capable of deriving concentration inequalities, i.e. tail bounds from above or below but not necessarily both simultaneously. 
0808.02089	Capacity-achieving Feedback Scheme for Gaussian Finite-State Markov Channels with Channel State Information	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Jialing Liu, Nicola Elia, Sekhar Tatikonda	Abstract:  In this paper, we propose capacity-achieving communication schemes for Gaussian finite-state Markov channels (FSMCs) subject to an average channel input power constraint, under the assumption that the transmitters can have access to delayed noiseless output feedback as well as instantaneous or delayed channel state information (CSI). We show that the proposed schemes reveals connections between feedback communication and feedback control. 
0808.02090	Self-Similar Polytropic Champagne Flows in H II Regions	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ren-Yu Hu, Yu-Qing Lou	Abstract:  We explore large-scale hydrodynamics of H II regions for various self-similar shock flows of a polytropic gas cloud under self-gravity and with quasi-spherical symmetry. We formulate cloud dynamics by invoking specific entropy conservation along streamlines and obtain global self-similar "champagne flows" for a conventional polytropic gas with shocks as a subclass. Molecular cloud cores are ionized and heated to high temperatures after the onset of nuclear burning of a central protostar. We model subsequent evolutionary processes in several ways and construct possible self-similar shock flow solutions. We may neglect the mass and gravity of the central protostar. The ionization and heating of the surrounding medium drive outflows in the inner cloud core and a shock travels outwards, leading to the so-called "champagne phase" with an expanding outer cloud envelope. Complementarily, we also consider the expansion of a central cavity around the centre. As the inner cloud expands plausibly due to powerful stellar winds, a cavity (i.e., `void' or `bubble') can be created around the centre, and when the cavity becomes sufficiently large, one may neglect the gravity of the central protostar. We thus present self-similar shock solutions for "champagne flows" with an expanding central void. We compare our solutions with isothermal solutions and find that the generalization to the polytropic regime brings about significant differences of the gas dynamics, especially for cases of n<1, where n is a key scaling index in the self-similar transformation. We also compare our global polytropic self-similar solutions with numerical simulations on the expansion of H II regions. 
0808.02091	The Family Problem	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:W-Y. Pauchy Hwang	Abstract:  We all know that in our family of particle physics we have three generations but still don't know why - the so-called "family problem". On other hand, in view of the masses and oscillations, the neutrinos now present some basic difficulty in the Standard Model. In this note, I propose that on top of the SU_c(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) standard model there is an SU_f (3) extension - a simple SU_c(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) \times SU_f (3) extended standard model. The family gauge bosons (familons) are massive through the so-called "colored" Higgs mechanism while the remaining Higgs particles are also massive. The three neutrinos, the electron-like, muon-like, and tao-like neutrinos, form the basic family triplets. Hopefully all the couplings to the "visible" matter are through the neutrinos, explaining why dark matter (25 %) is more than visible matter (5 %) in our Universe. 
0808.02092	On zero-rate error exponent for BSC with noisy feedback	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Marat V. Burnashev, Hirosuke Yamamoto	Abstract:  For the information transmission a binary symmetric channel is used. There is also another noisy binary symmetric channel (feedback channel), and the transmitter observes without delay all the outputs of the forward channel via that feedback channel. The transmission of a nonexponential number of messages (i.e. the transmission rate equals zero) is considered. The achievable decoding error exponent for such a combination of channels is investigated. It is shown that if the crossover probability of the feedback channel is less than a certain positive value, then the achievable error exponent is better than the similar error exponent of the no-feedback channel. The transmission method described and the corresponding lower bound for the error exponent can be strengthened, and also extended to the positive transmission rates. 
0808.02093	Are dumbbell brightest cluster members signposts to galaxy cluster activity?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:K. A. Pimbblet	Abstract:  We assemble a sample of galaxy clusters whose brightest members are dumbbell galaxies and compare them with a control sample in order to investigate if they are the result of recent mergers. We show that the dumbbell sample is no more likely than other clusters to exhibit subclustering. However, they are much more likely to have at least one dumbbell component possessing a significant peculiar velocity with respect to the parent cluster than a non-dumbbell brightest cluster member. We interpret this in the context of seeing the clusters at various stages of post-merger relaxation. 
0808.02094	Why phase diagrams of different underdoped cuprates are remarkably different? Disorder versus bilayer	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:O. P. Sushkov	Abstract:  Contrary to a widely accepted view the phase diagrams of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$\rm_{6+y}$, in spite of similarities are remarkably different. Both the electric conduction properties and the commensurate/incommensurate spin ordering properties differ dramatically. It is argued that the role of disorder in YBCO is insignificant while the bilayer structure is crucial. On the other hand in LSCO the intrinsic disorder to a large extent drives the properties of the system. The developed approach explains the low-temperature magnetic properties of the systems. The most important point is the difference with respect to the incommensurate spin ordering, including the difference in the incommensurate pitches. The present analysis demonstrates that the superconductivity is intimately related to the incommensurate spin ordering. 
0808.02095	Stochastic Resonance in an Overdamped Monostable System	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:N.V.Agudov, A.V.Krichigin	Abstract:  We show, the SR can appear in monostable overdamped systems driven by additive mix of periodical signal and white Gaussian noise. It can be observed as nonmonotonic dependence of SNR on the input noise intensity. In this sense it is similar to classical SR observed in overdamped bistable systems with potential barrier. 
0808.02096	Fast Scramblers	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Yasuhiro Sekino, Leonard Susskind	Abstract:  We consider the problem of how fast a quantum system can scramble (thermalize) information, given that the interactions are between bounded clusters of degrees of freedom; pairwise interactions would be an example. Based on previous work, we conjecture: 1) The most rapid scramblers take a time logarithmic in the number of degrees of freedom. 2) Matrix quantum mechanics (systems whose degrees of freedom are n by n matrices) saturate the bound. 3) Black holes are the fastest scramblers in nature. The conjectures are based on two sources, one from quantum information theory, and the other from the study of black holes in String Theory. 
0808.02097	A class of compact Poincare-Einstein manifolds: properties and construction	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:A. Rod Gover, Felipe Leitner	Abstract:  We develop a geometric and explicit construction principle that generates classes of Poincare-Einstein manifolds, and more generally almost Einstein manifolds. Almost Einstein manifolds satisfy a generalisation of the Einstein condition; they are Einstein on an open dense subspace and, in general, have a conformal scale singularity set that is a conformal infinity for the Einstein metric. In particular, the construction may be applied to yield families of compact Poincare-Einstein manifolds, as well as classes of almost Einstein manifolds that are compact without boundary. We obtain classification results which show that the construction essentially exhausts a class of almost Einstein (and Poincare-Einstein) manifold. We develop the general theory of fixed conformal structures admitting multiple compatible almost Einstein structures. We also show that, in a class of cases, these are canonically related to a family of constant mean curvature totally umbillic embedded hypersurfaces. 
0808.02098	Evolution of scalar perturbations in cosmology with quintessential dark energy	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:B. Novosyadlyj, O. Sergijenko	Abstract:  The dynamics of expansion of the Universe and evolution of scalar perturbations are studied for the quintessential scalar fields $Q$ with the classical Lagrangian satisfying the additional condition $w=const$ or $c^2_a=0$. Both quintessential fields are studied for the same cosmological model. The systems of evolutionary equations for gauge-invariant perturbations of metrics, matter and quintessence have been analysed analyticaly for the early stage of the Universe life and numerically up to the present epoch. It is shown that amplitudes of the adiabatic matter density perturbations grow like in $Λ$CDM-model but time dependences of amplitudes of the quintessence perturbations are more varied: gauge-invariant variables $D_g^{(Q)}$ and $D_s^{(Q)}$ decay from initial constant value after entering the particle horizon while $D^{(Q)}$ and $V^{(Q)}$ grow at the early stage before entering the horizon and decay after that -- in the quintessence-dominated epoch, when gravitational potential starts to decay -- so, that at the current epoch they are approximately two orders lower than matter ones at the supercluster scale. Therefore, at the subhorizon scales the quintessential scalar fields are smoothed out while the matter clusters. It is also shown that both quintessential scalar fields suppress the growth of matter density perturbations and the amplitude of gravitational potential. In these QCDM-models -- unlike $Λ$CDM ones -- such suppression is scale dependent and more visible for the quintessence with $c^2_a=0$. 
0808.02099	All exceptional surgeries on alternating knots are integral surgeries	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Kazuhiro Ichihara	Abstract:  We show that all exceptional surgeries on hyperbolic alternating knots in the 3-sphere are integral surgeries. 
0808.02100	Nonlinear Shear-free Radiative Collapse	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:S. S. Misthry, S. D. Maharaj, P. G. L. Leach	Abstract:  We study realistic models of relativistic radiating stars undergoing gravitational collapse which have vanishing Weyl tensor components. Previous investigations are generalised by retaining the inherent nonlinearity at the boundary. We transform the boundary condition to an Abel equation of the first kind. A variety of nonlinear solutions are generated all of which can be written explicitly. Several classes of infinite solutions exist. 
0808.02101	A Riccati equation in radiative stellar collapse	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:S. S. Rajah, S.D. Maharaj	Abstract:  We model the behaviour of a relativistic spherically symmetric shearing fluid undergoing gravitational collapse with heat flux. It is demonstrated that the governing equation for the gravitational behaviour is a Riccati equation. We show that the Riccati equation admits two classes of new solutions in closed form. We regain particular models, obtained in previous investigations, as special cases. A significant feature of our solutions is the general spatial dependence in the metric functions which allows for a wider study of the physical features of the model, such as the behaviour of the causal temperature in inhomogeneous spacetimes. 
0808.02102	Generalized Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac and Acharya-Swamy Statistics and the Polya Urn Model	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Robert K. Niven, Marian Grendar	Abstract:  Generalized probability distributions for Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics, with unequal source probabilities $q_i$ for each level $i$, are obtained by combinatorial reasoning. For equiprobable degenerate sublevels, these reduce to those given by Brillouin in 1930, more commonly given as a statistical weight for each statistic. These distributions and corresponding cross-entropy (divergence) functions are shown to be special cases of the Pólya urn model, involving neither independent nor identically distributed ("ninid") sampling. The most probable Pólya distribution contains the Acharya-Swamy intermediate statistic. 
0808.02103	Quasielastic and inelastic neutrino reactions in $^{12}C$ at K2K energies	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:M. Sajjad Athar, S. Chauhan, S. K. Singh	Abstract:  In this paper, we present the results of a study made for the effect of nuclear medium in the charged current induced quasielastic lepton production(CCQE) and the incoherent and coherent one pion production (CC1$π^+$)processes from $^{12}C$ in the $ν_μ$ energy region of 0.4-3GeV. The theoretical results are compared with the recent experimental results for the ratio of charged current $ν_μ$ induced one pion production cross section to the quasielastic lepton production cross section reported by K2K collaboration. We also present the results for the angular and momentum distributions of leptons and pions produced in these processes. 
0808.02104	The flipping puzzle on a graph	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Hau-wen Huang, Chih-wen Weng	Abstract:  Let $S$ be a connected graph which contains an induced path of $n-1$ vertices, where $n$ is the order of $S.$ We consider a puzzle on $S$. A configuration of the puzzle is simply an $n$-dimensional column vector over $\{0, 1\}$ with coordinates of the vector indexed by the vertex set $S$. For each configuration $u$ with a coordinate $u_s=1$, there exists a move that sends $u$ to the new configuration which flips the entries of the coordinates adjacent to $s$ in $u.$ We completely determine if one configuration can move to another in a sequence of finite steps. 
0808.02105	The Compact Structure of Radio-Loud Broad Absorption Line Quasars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Y. Liu, D. R.Jiang, T. G. Wang, F. G. Xie	Abstract:  We present the results of EVN+MERLIN VLBI polarization observations of 8 Broad Absorption Line (BAL) quasars at 1.6 GHz, including 4 LoBALs and 4 HiBALs with either steep or flat spectra on VLA scales. Only one steep-spectrum source, J1122+3124, shows two-sided structure on the scale of 2 kpc. The other four steep-spectrum sources and three flat-spectrum sources display either an unresolved image or a core-jet structure on scales of less than three hundred parsecs. In all cases the marginally resolved core is the dominant radio component. Linear polarization in the cores has been detected in the range of a few to 10 percent. Polarization, together with high brightness temperatures (from 2*10^9-5*10^10 K), suggest a synchrotron origin for the radio emission. There is no apparent difference in the radio orphologies or polarization between low-ionization and high-ionization BAL QSOs nor between flat- and steep-spectrum sources. We discuss the orientation of BAL QSOs with both flat and steep spectra, and consider a possible evolutionary scenario for BAL QSOs. In this scenario, BAL QSOs are probably the young population of radio sources, which are Compact Steep Spectrum or GHz peaked radio source analog at the low end of radio power. 
0808.02106	Multiple charge density wave transitions in Gd$_2$Te$_5$	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:K. Y. Shin, N. Ru, C. L. Condron, Y. Q. Wu, M. J. Kramer, M. F. Toney, I. R. Fisher	Abstract:  Diffraction measurements performed via transmission electron microscopy and high resolution X-ray scattering reveal two distinct charge density wave transitions in Gd$_2$Te$_5$ at $T_{c1}$ = 410(3) and $T_{c2}$ = 532(3) K, associated with the \textit{on}-axis incommensurate lattice modulation and \textit{off}-axis commensurate lattice modulation respectively. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the order parameters indicates a non-vanishing coupling between these two distinct CDW states. 
0808.02107	Prolific pair production with high-power lasers	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:A. R. Bell, John G. Kirk	Abstract:  Prolific electron-positron pair production is possible at laser intensities approaching 10^{24} W/cm^2 at a wavelength of 1 micron. An analysis of electron trajectories and interactions at the nodes (B=0) of two counter-propagating, circularly polarised laser beams shows that a cascade of gamma-rays and pairs develops. The geometry is generalised qualitatively to linear polarisation and laser beams incident on a solid target. 
0808.02108	Non-linear Integral Equations and Determinant Formulae of the Open XXZ Spin Chain	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:A. Seel, T. Wirth	Abstract:  We derive a non-linear integral equation for the Bethe-ansatz solvable open XXZ spin chain of arbitrary length describing the lowest lying state with zero magnetization. For this case we show how to combine the integral representation with the known determinant formula of norms and scalar products. 
0808.02109	Two Parallel Swendsen-Wang Cluster Algorithms Using Message-Passing Paradigm	Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)	Authors:Shizeng Lin, Bo Zheng	Abstract:  In this article, we present two different parallel Swendsen-Wang Cluster(SWC) algorithms using message-passing interface(MPI). One is based on Master-Slave Parallel Model(MSPM) and the other is based on Data-Parallel Model(DPM). A speedup of 24 with 40 processors and 16 with 37 processors is achieved with the DPM and MSPM respectively. The speedup of both algorithms at different temperature and system size is carefully examined both experimentally and theoretically, and a comparison of their efficiency is made. In the last section, based on these two parallel SWC algorithms, two parallel probability changing cluster(PCC) algorithms are proposed. 
0808.02110	Quadrupole Susceptibility and Elastic Softening due to a Vacancy in Silicon Crystal	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Takemi Yamada, Youichi Yamakawa, Yoshiaki Ōno	Abstract:  We investigate the electronic states around a single vacancy in silicon crystal by using the Green's function approach. The triply degenerate vacancy states within the band gap are found to be extended over a large distance $\sim20 {\rm Å}$ from the vacancy site and contribute to the reciprocal temperature dependence of the quadrupole susceptibility resulting in the elastic softening at low temperture. The Curie constant of the quadrupole susceptibility for the trigonal mode ($O_{yz},O_{zx},O_{xy}$) is largely enhanced as compared to that for the tetragonal mode ($O_{2}^{0},O_{2}^{2}$). The obtained results are consistent with the recent ultrasonic experiments in silicon crystal down to 20 mK. We also calculate the dipole and octupole susceptibilities and find that the octupole susceptibilities are extremely enhannced for a specific mode. 
0808.02111	The main sequence from F to K stars of the solar neighbourhood in SDSS colours	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Just, H. Jahreiss	Abstract:  For an understanding of Galactic stellar populations in the SDSS filter system well defined stellar samples are needed. The nearby stars provide a complete stellar sample representative for the thin disc population. We compare the filter transformations of different authors applied to the main sequence stars from F to K dwarfs to SDSS filter system and discuss the properties of the main sequence. The location of the mean main sequence in colour-magnitude diagrams is very sensitive to systematic differences in the filter transformation. A comparison with fiducial sequences of star clusters observed in g',r',i' show good agreement. Theoretical isochrones from Padua and from Dartmouth have still some problems especially in (r-i)-colour. 
0808.02112	The lack of carbon stars in the Galactic bulge	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Zhu Chunhua, Lv Guoliang, Wang Zhaojun, Zhang Jun	Abstract:  In order to explain the lack of carbon stars in the Galactic bulge, we have made a detailed study of thermal pulse - asymptotic giant branch stars by using a population synthesis code. The effects of the oxygen overabundance and the mass loss rate on the ratio of the number of carbon stars to that of oxygen stars in the Galactic bulge are discussed. We find that the oxygen overabundance which is about twice as large as that in the solar neighbourhood (close to the present observations) is insufficient to explain the rareness of carbon stars in the bulge. We suggest that the large mass loss rate may serve as a controlling factor in the ratio of the number of carbon stars to that of oxygen stars. 
0808.02113	Exclusive semileptonic decays of $Λ_b \to Λl^{+} l^{-}$ in supersymmetric theories	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:M. Jamil Aslam, Yu-Ming Wang, Cai-Dian Lu	Abstract:  The weak decays of $Λ_b \to Λl^{+} l^{-}$ ($l=e, μ$) are investigated in Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and also in Supersymmetric (SUSY) SO(10) Grand Unified Models. In MSSM the special attention is paid to the Neutral Higgs Bosons (NHBs) as they make quite a large contribution in exclusive $B \to X_{s} l^{+} l^{-}$ decays at large $\tanβ$ regions of parameter space of SUSY models, since part of SUSY contributions is proportional to $\tan^{3}β$. The analysis of decay rate, forward-backward asymmetries, lepton polarization asymmetries and the polarization asymmetries of $Λ$ baryon in $Λ_b \to Λl^{+} l^{-}$ show that the values of these physical observables are greatly modified by the effects of NHBs. In SUSY SO(10) GUT model, the new physics contribution comes from the operators which are induced by the NHBs penguins and also from the operators having chirality opposite to that of the corresponding SM operators. SUSY SO(10) effects show up only in the decay $Λ_b \to Λ +τ^{+} τ^{-}$ where the longitudinal and transverse lepton polarization asymmetries are deviate significantly from the SM value while the effects in the decay rate, forward-backward asymmetries and polarization asymmetries of final state $Λ$ baryon are very mild. The transverse lepton polarization asymmetry in $Λ_b \to Λ+τ^{+} τ^{-}$ is almost zero in SM and in MSSM model. However, it can reach to -0.1 in SUSY SO(10) GUT model and could be seen at the future colliders; hence this asymmetry observable will provide us useful information to probe new physics and discriminate between different models. 
0808.02114	Final-state interactions in the decays $B^0\toχ_{c0}K^{*0}$ and $B^+ \to χ_{c0}K^{*+}$	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Zhi-Gang Wang	Abstract:  In this article, we study the final-state rescattering effects in the decays $B^0\to χ_{c0}K^{*0}$ and $B^+ \to χ_{c0}K^{*+}$, and observe the corrections are zero in the SU(3) limit, which is warranted by the heavy quark symmetry. It is difficult to accommodate the experimental data without fine-tuning. 
0808.02115	N/O-trends in Late-Type Galaxies: AGB-stars, IMFs, Abundance Gradients and the Origin of Nitrogen	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Lars Mattsson	Abstract:  Models of galactic chemical evolution (CEMs) show that the shape of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and other assumptions regarding star formation affect the resultant abundance gradients in models of late-type galaxies. Furthermore, intermediate mass (IM) stars undeniably play an important role in the buildup of nitrogen abundances in galaxies. Here I specifically discuss the nitrogen contribution from IM/AGB stars and how it affects the N/O-gradient. For this purpose I have modelled the chemical evolution of a few nearby disc galaxies using different IMFs and star formation prescriptions. It is demonstrated that N/O-gradients may be used to constrain the nitrogen contribution from IM/AGB-stars. 
0808.02116	Erdos-Renyi random graphs + forest fires = self-organized criticality	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Balazs Rath (TU Budapest, Institute of Mathematics), Balint Toth (TU Budapest, Institute of Mathematics)    	Abstract:  We modify the usual Erdos-Renyi random graph evolution by letting connected clusters 'burn down' (i.e. fall apart to disconnected single sites) due to a Poisson flow of lightnings. In a range of the intensity of rate of lightnings the system sticks to a permanent critical state. 
0808.02117	Local Hamiltonians in Quantum Computation	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Daniel Nagaj	Abstract:  In this thesis, I investigate aspects of local Hamiltonians in quantum computing. First, I focus on the Adiabatic Quantum Computing model, based on evolution with a time dependent Hamiltonian. I show that to succeed using AQC, the Hamiltonian involved must have local structure, which leads to a result about eigenvalue gaps from information theory. I also improve results about simulating quantum circuits with AQC. Second, I look at classically simulating time evolution with local Hamiltonians and finding their ground state properties. I give a numerical method for finding the ground state of translationally invariant Hamiltonians on an infinite tree. This method is based on imaginary time evolution within the Matrix Product State ansatz, and uses a new method for bringing the state back to the ansatz after each imaginary time step. I then use it to investigate the phase transition in the transverse field Ising model on the Bethe lattice. Third, I focus on locally constrained quantum problems Local Hamiltonian and Quantum Satisfiability and prove several new results about their complexity. Finally, I define a Hamiltonian Quantum Cellular Automaton, a continuous-time model of computation which doesn't require control during the computation process, only preparation of product initial states. I construct two of these, showing that time evolution with a simple, local, translationally invariant and time-independent Hamiltonian can be used to simulate quantum circuits. 
0808.02118	Study of exclusive processes e^+ e^- \to VP	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:V. V. Braguta, A. K. Likhoded, A. V. Luchinsky	Abstract:  This paper is devoted to consideration of the hard exclusive processes $e^+e^- \to VP$, where $V=ρ,φ; P=η,η'$. Experimental measurement of the cross section of the process $e^+ e^- \to φη$ at BaBar collaboration at large center mass energy $\sqrt s=10.6$ GeV and some low energy experimental data $\sqrt s \sim 2-4$ GeV give us the possibility to study the cross section in the broad energy region. As the result, we have determined the asymptotic behavior of the cross section of $e^+ e^- \to φη$ in the limit $s \to \infty$, which is in agreement with perturbative QCD prediction. Assuming that the same asymptotic behavior is valid for the other processes under consideration and using low energy experimental data we have predicted the cross sections of these processes at energies $\sqrt s=3.67,~10.6$ GeV. In addition, we have calculated the cross sections of these processes at the same energies within perturbative QCD. Our results are in agreement with available experimental data. 
0808.02119	The Maskit embedding of the twice punctured torus	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Caroline Series	Abstract:  The Maskit embedding M of a surface Σis the space of geometrically finite groups on the boundary of quasifuchsian space for which the `top' end is homeomorphic to Σ, while the `bottom' end consists of two triply punctured spheres, the remains of Σwhen two fixed disjoint curves have been pinched. As such representations vary in the character variety, the conformal structure on the top side varies over the Teichmüller space T(Σ). We investigate M when Σis a twice punctured torus, using the method of pleating rays. Fix a projective measure class [μ] supported on closed curves on Σ. The pleating ray P_[μ] consists of those groups in M for which the bending measure of the top component of the convex hull boundary of the associated 3-manifold is in [μ]. It is known that P is a real 1-submanifold of M. Our main result is a formula for the asymptotic direction of P in M as the bending measure tends to zero, in terms of natural parameters for the 2-complex dimensional representation space R and the Dehn-Thurston coordinates of the support curves to [μ] relative to the pinched curves on the bottom side. This leads to a method of locating M in R. 
0808.02120	Adjoint vector fields and differential operators on representation spaces	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Dmitri I. Panyushev	Abstract:  Let $G$ be a semisimple algebraic group with Lie algebra $\g$. In 1979, J. Dixmier proved that any vector field annihilating all $G$-invariant polynomials on $\g$ lies in the $\bbk[\g]$-module generated by the "adjoint vector fields", i.e., vector fields $ς$ of the form $ς(y)(x)=[x,y]$, $x,y\in\g$. A substantial generalisation of Dixmier's theorem was found by Levasseur and Stafford. They explicitly described the centraliser of $\bbk[\g]^G$ in the algebra of differential operators on $\g$. On the level of vector fields, their result reduces to Dixmier's theorem. The purpose of this paper is to explore similar problems in the general context of affine algebraic groups and their rational representations. 
0808.02121	Static-light meson masses from twisted mass lattice QCD	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:ETM Collaboration: Karl Jansen, Chris Michael, Andrea Shindler, Marc Wagner	Abstract:  We compute the static-light meson spectrum using two-flavor Wilson twisted mass lattice QCD. We have considered five different values for the light quark mass corresponding to 300 MeV < m_PS < 600 MeV. We have extrapolated our results, to make predictions regarding the spectrum of B and B_s mesons. 
0808.02122	Two-dimensional models of type theory	Logic (math.LO)	Authors:Richard Garner	Abstract:  We describe a non-extensional variant of Martin-Löf type theory which we call two-dimensional type theory, and equip it with a sound and complete semantics valued in 2-categories. 
0808.02123	Mathieu functions approach to bidimensional scattering by dielectric elliptical cylinders	Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)	Authors:E. Cojocaru	Abstract:  Two-dimensional scattering by homogeneous and layered dielectric elliptical cylinders is analyzed following an analytical approach using Mathieu functions. Closed-form relations for the expansion coefficients of the resulting electric field in the vicinity of the scatterer are provided. Numerical examples show the focalizing effect of dielectric elliptical cylinders illuminated normally to the axis. The influence of the confocal dielectric cover on the resulting scattered field is envisaged. 
0808.02124	Monte Carlo studies of extensions of the Blume-Emery-Griffiths model	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:C.C. Loois, G.T. Barkema, C. Morais Smith	Abstract:  We extend the Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) model to a two-component BEG model in order to study 2D systems with two order parameters, such as magnetic superconductors or two-component Bose-Einstein condensates. The model is investigated using Monte Carlo simulations, and the temperature-concentration phase diagram is determined in the presence and absence of an external magnetic field. This model exhibits a rich phase diagram, including a second-order transition to a phase where superconductivity and magnetism coexist. Results are compared with experiments on Cerium-based heavy-fermion superconductors. To study cold atom mixtures, we also simulate the BEG and two-component BEG models with a trapping potential. In the BEG model with a trap, there is no longer a first order transition to a true phase-separated regime, but a crossover to a kind of phase-separated region. The relation with imbalanced fermi-mixtures is discussed. We present the phase diagram of the two-component BEG model with a trap, which can describe boson-boson mixtures of cold atoms. Although there are no experimental results yet for the latter, we hope that our predictions could help to stimulate future experiments in this direction. 
0808.02125	Data mining and accelerated electronic structure theory as a tool in the search for new functional materials	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:C. Ortiz, O.Eriksson, M. Klintenberg	Abstract:  Data mining is a recognized predictive tool in a variety of areas ranging from bioinformatics and drug design to crystal structure prediction. In the present study, an electronic structure implementation has been combined with structural data from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database to generate results for highly accelerated electronic structure calculations of about 22,000 inorganic compounds. It is shown how data mining algorithms employed on the database can identify new functional materials with desired materials properties, resulting in a prediction of 136 novel materials with potential for use as detector materials for ionizing radiation. The methodology behind the automatized ab-initio approach is presented, results are tabulated and a version of the complete database is made available at the internet web site this http URL (Ref.1). 
0808.02126	Locality, detection efficiencies, and probability polytopes	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:J. Wilms, Y. Disser, G. Alber, I. C. Percival	Abstract:  We present a detailed investigation of minimum detection efficiencies, below which locality cannot be violated by any quantum system of any dimension in bipartite Bell experiments. Lower bounds on these minimum detection efficiencies are determined with the help of linear programming techniques. Our approach is based on the observation that any possible bipartite quantum correlation originating from a quantum state in an arbitrary dimensional Hilbert space is sandwiched between two probability polytopes, namely the local (Bell) polytope and a corresponding nonlocal no-signaling polytope. Numerical results are presented demonstrating the dependence of these lower bounds on the numbers of inputs and outputs of the bipartite physical system. 
0808.02127	Collective excitations in two-dimensional antiferromagnet in strong magnetic field	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:A.V. Syromyatnikov	Abstract:  We discuss spin-$\frac12$ two-dimensional (2D) Heisenberg antiferromagnet (AF) on a square lattice at T=0 in strong magnetic field H near its saturation value $H_c$. A perturbation approach is proposed to obtain spectrum of magnons with momenta not very close to AF vector in the leading order in small parameter $(H_c-H)/H_c$. We find that magnons are well-defined quasi-particles at $H>0.9H_c$ although the damping is quite large near the zone boundary. A characteristic rotonlike local minimum in the spectrum is observed at ${\bf k}=(π,0)$ accompanied by decrease of the damping near $(π,0)$. The suggested approach can be used in discussion of short-wavelength excitations in other 2D Bose gases of particles or quasi-particles. 
0808.02128	Automation of the Dipole Subtraction Method in MadGraph/MadEvent	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Rikkert Frederix, Thomas Gehrmann, Nicolas Greiner	Abstract:  We present the implementation of the dipole subtraction formalism for the real radiation contributions to any next-to-leading order QCD process in the MadGraph/MadEvent framework. Both massless and massive dipoles are considered. Starting from a specific (n+1)-particle process the package provides a Fortran code for all possible dipoles to all Born processes that constitute the subtraction term to the (n+1)-particle process. The output files are given in the usual "MadGraph StandAlone" style using helicity amplitudes. 
0808.02129	Is there a redshift cutoff for submillimetre galaxies?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:G. Raymond, S. A. Eales, S. Dye, R. Carlberg, M. Sullivan	Abstract:  We present new optical and infrared photometry for a statistically complete sample of seven 1.1 mm selected sources with accurate Submillimetre Array coordinates. We determine photometric redshifts for four of the seven sources of 4.47, 4.50, 1.49 and 0.64. Of the other three sources two are undetected at optical wavelengths down to the limits of very deep Subaru and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope images ($\sim$27 mag AB, i band) and the photometry of the remaining source is corrupted by a bright nearby galaxy. The sources with the highest redshifts are at higher redshifts than all but one of the $\sim$200 sources taken from the largest recent 850 $μ$m surveys, which may indicate that 1.1 mm surveys are more efficient at finding sources at very high redshifts than 850 $μ$m surveys. We investigate the evolution of the number density with redshift of our sample using a banded $V_{e}/V_{a}$ analysis and find no evidence for a redshift cutoff, although the number of sources is very small. We also perform the same analysis on a statistically complete sample of 38 galaxies selected at 850$μ$m from the GOODS-N field and find evidence for a drop-off in the number density beyond $z\sim1$ and 2 for hot and cold dust dominated SMGs respectively, confirming the earlier conclusion of Wall, Pope & Scott. We also find strong evidence for the existence of two differently evolving sub-populations separated in luminosity, with a higher relative density of the high luminosity galaxies at higher redshifts. 
0808.02130	Electric/magnetic duality for chiral gauge theories with anomaly cancellation	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Jan De Rydt, Torsten T. Schmidt, Mario Trigiante, Antoine Van Proeyen, Marco Zagermann	Abstract:  We show that 4D gauge theories with Green-Schwarz anomaly cancellation and possible generalized Chern-Simons terms admit a formulation that is manifestly covariant with respect to electric/magnetic duality transformations. This generalizes previous work on the symplectically covariant formulation of anomaly-free gauge theories as they typically occur in extended supergravity, and now also includes general theories with (pseudo-)anomalous gauge interactions as they may occur in global or local N=1 supersymmetry. This generalization is achieved by relaxing the linear constraint on the embedding tensor so as to allow for a symmetric 3-tensor related to electric and/or magnetic quantum anomalies in these theories. Apart from electric and magnetic gauge fields, the resulting Lagrangians also feature two-form fields and can accommodate various unusual duality frames as they often appear, e.g., in string compactifications with background fluxes. 
0808.02131	Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and black holes	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Kostyantyn Ropotenko	Abstract:  It is shown that stringy matter near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole exhibits chaotic behavior (the spreading effect) which can be characterized by the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. It is found that the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of a spreading string equals to the half of the inverse gravitational radius of the black hole. But the KS entropy is the same for all objects collapsing into the black hole. The nature of this universality is that the KS entropy possesses the main property of temperature: it is the same for all bodies in thermal equilibrium with the black hole. The Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy measures the rate at which information about the string is lost as it spreads over the horizon. It is argued that it is the maximum rate allowed by quantum theory. A possible relation between the Kolmogorov-Sinai and Bekenstein-Hawking entropies is discussed. 
0808.02132	Bound-state third-order optical nonlinearities of embedded germanium nanocrystals	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Hasan Yildirim, Ceyhun Bulutay	Abstract:  Embedded germanium nanocrystals (NCs) in a silica host matrix are theoretically analyzed to identify their third-order bound-state nonlinearities. A rigorous atomistic pseudopotential approach is used for determining the electronic structure and the nonlinear optical susceptibilities. This study characterizing the two-photon absorption, nonlinear refractive index, and optical switching parameters reveals the full wavelength dependence from static up to the ultraviolet spectrum and the size dependence up to a diameter of 3.5 nm. Similar to Si NCs, the intensity-dependent refractive index increases with decreasing NC diameter. On the other hand, Ge NCs possess about an order of magnitude smaller nonlinear susceptibility compared to Si NCs of the same size. It is observed that the two-photon absorption threshold extends beyond the half band-gap value. This enables nonlinear refractive index tunability over a much wider wavelength range free from two-photon absorption. 
0808.02133	Comments on Scalar-Tensor Representation of $f(R)$ Theories	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yousef Bisabr	Abstract:  We propose a scalar-tensor representation of $f(R)$ theories with use of conformal transformations. In this representation, the model takes the form of the Brans-Dicke model with a potential function and a non-zero kinetic term for the scalar field. We show that due to interaction of the scalar field with matter systems, the corresponding matter stress tensor is not conserved and test particles experience an anomalous acceleration. 
0808.02134	X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurement on the LaO1-xFxFeAs system	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:A. Ignatov, C. L. Zhang, M. Vannucci, M. Croft, T. A. Tyson, D. Kwok, Z. Qin, S.-W. Cheong	Abstract:  Results of Fe K-, As K-, and La L3-edge x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements on LaO1-xFxFeAs compounds are presented. The Fe K- edge exhibits a chemical shift to lower energy, near edge feature modifications, and pre-edge feature suppression as a result of F substitution for O. The former two changes provide evidence of electron charge transfer to the Fe sites and the latter directly supports the delivery of this charge into the Fe-3d orbitals. The As K- edge measurements show spectral structures typical of compounds with planes of transition-metal tetrahedrally coordinated to p-block elements as is illustrated by comparison to other such materials. The insensitivity of the As-K edge to doping, along with the strong Fe-K doping response, is consistent with band structure calculations showing essentially pure Fe-d character near the Fermi energy in these materials. The energy of the continuum resonance feature above the La-L3 edge is shown to be quantitatively consistent with the reported La-O inter-atomic separation and with other oxide compounds containing rare earth elements. 
0808.02135	A multi-zone model for simulating the high energy variability of TeV blazars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Philip B. Graff, Markos Georganopoulos, Eric S. Perlman, Demosthenes Kazanas	Abstract:  We present a time-dependent multi-zone code for simulating the variability of Synchrotron-Self Compton (SSC) sources. The code adopts a multi-zone pipe geometry for the emission region, appropriate for simulating emission from a standing or propagating shock in a collimated jet. Variations in the injection of relativistic electrons in the inlet propagate along the length of the pipe cooling radiatively. Our code for the first time takes into account the non-local, time-retarded nature of synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) losses that are thought to be dominant in TeV blazars. The observed synchrotron and SSC emission is followed self-consistently taking into account light travel time delays. At any given time, the emitting portion of the pipe depends on the frequency and the nature of the variation followed. Our simulation employs only one additional physical parameter relative to one-zone models, that of the pipe length and is computationally very efficient, using simplified expressions for the SSC processes. The code will be useful for observers modeling GLAST, TeV, and X-ray observations of SSC blazars. 
0808.02136	Fermion Families from Two Layer Warped Extra Dimensions	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Zhi-qiang Guo, Bo-Qiang Ma	Abstract:  In extra dimensions, the quark and lepton mass hierarchy can be reproduced from the same order bulk mass parameters, and standard model fermion families can be generated from one generation in the high dimensional space. We try to explain the origin of the same order bulk mass parameters and address the family replication puzzle simultaneously. We show that they correlate with each other. We construct models that families are generated from extra dimensional space, and in the meantime the bulk mass parameters of same order emerge naturally. The interesting point is that the bulk mass parameters, which are in same order, correspond to the eigenvalues of a Schrödinger-like equation. We also discuss the problem existing in this approach. 
0808.02137	19F nuclear spin relaxation and spin diffusion effects in the single ion magnet LiYF4:Ho3+	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:B. Z. Malkin, M. V. Vanyunin, M. J. Graf, J. Lago, F. Borsa, A. Lascialfari, A. M. Tkachuk, B. Barbara	Abstract:  Temperature and magnetic field dependences of the 19F nuclear spin-lattice relaxation in a single crystal of LiYF4 doped with holmium are described by an approach based on a detailed consideration of the magnetic dipole-dipole interactions between nuclei and impurity paramagnetic ions and nuclear spin diffusion processes. The observed non-exponential long time recovery of the nuclear magnetization after saturation at intermediate temperatures is in agreement with predictions of the spin-diffusion theory in a case of the diffusion limited relaxation. At avoided level crossings in the spectrum of electron-nuclear states of the Ho3+ ion, rates of nuclear spin-lattice relaxation increase due to quasi-resonant energy exchange between nuclei and paramagnetic ions, in contrast to the predominant role played by electronic cross-relaxation processes in the low-frequency ac-susceptibility. 
0808.02138	Theory of Specific Heat in Glass Forming Systems	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:H.G.E. Hentschel, Valery Ilyin, Itamar Procaccia, Nurith Schupper	Abstract:  Experimental measurements of the specific heat in glass-forming systems reveal anomalies in the temperature dependence of the specific heat, including the so called "specific heat peak" in the vicinity of the glass transition. The aim of this paper is to provide theoretical explanations of these anomalies in general and a quantitative theory in the case of a simple model of glass-formation. We first present new simulation results for the specific heat in a classical model of a binary mixture. We show that in addition to the formerly observed specific heat peak there is a second peak at lower temperatures which was not observable in earlier simulations. Second, we present a general relation between the specific heat and the bulk modulus and thus offer a smooth connection between the liquid and amorphous solid states. The central result of this paper is a connection between the micro-melting of clusters in the system and the appearance of specific heat peaks. We relate the two peaks to changes in the bulk and shear moduli. We propose that the phenomenon of glass-formation is accompanied by a fast change in the bulk and the shear moduli, but these fast changes occur in different ranges of the temperature. Lastly, we demonstrate how to construct a theory of the frequency dependent complex specific heat, expected from heterogeneous clustering in the liquid state of glass formers. A specific example is provided in the context of our model for the dynamics of glycerol. The theoretical frequency dependent specific heat agrees well with experimental measurements on glycerol. We conclude the paper by stating that there is nothing universal about the temperature dependence of the specific heat in glass formers - unfortunately one needs to understand each case by itself. 
0808.02139	Misalignment of the microquasar V4641 Sgr (SAX J1819.3--2525)	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Rebecca G. Martin, Rubens C. Reis, J. E. Pringle	Abstract:  In the microquasar V4641 Sgr the spin of the black hole is thought to be misaligned with the binary orbital axis. The accretion disc aligns with the black hole spin by the Lense-Thirring effect near to the black hole and further out becomes aligned with the binary orbital axis. The inclination of the radio jets and the Fe$Kα$ line profile have both been used to determine the inclination of the inner accretion disc but the measurements are inconsistent. Using a steady state analytical warped disc model for V4641 Sgr we find that the inner disc region is flat and aligned with the black hole up to about $900 R_{\rm g}$. Thus if both the radio jet and fluorescent emission originates in the same inner region then the measurements of the inner disc inclination should be the same. 
0808.02140	Phase diagram of geometric d-wave superconductor Josephson junctions	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:A. Gumann, N. Schopohl	Abstract:  We show that a constriction-type Josephson junction realized by an epitactic thin film of a d-wave superconductor with an appropriate boundary geometry exhibits intrinsic phase differences between 0 and pi depending on geometric parameters and temperature. Based on microscopic Eilenberger theory, we provide a general derivation of the relation between the change of the free energy of the junction and the current-phase relation. From the change of the free energy, we calculate phase diagrams and discuss transitions driven by geometric parameters and temperature. 
0808.02141	A growing dynamo from a saturated Roberts flow dynamo	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Andreas Tilgner (G\"ottingen), Axel Brandenburg (Nordita)    	Abstract:  Using direct simulations, weakly nonlinear theory and nonlinear mean-field theory, it is shown that the quenched velocity field of a saturated nonlinear dynamo can itself act as a kinematic dynamo. The flow is driven by a forcing function that would produce a Roberts flow in the absence of a magnetic field. This result confirms an analogous finding by F. Cattaneo & S. M. Tobias (arXiv:0809.1801) for the more complicated case of turbulent convection, suggesting that this may be a common property of nonlinear dynamos; see also the talk given also online at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics (this http URL). It is argued that this property can be used to test nonlinear mean-field dynamo theories. 
0808.02142	An Abundance of Heterotic Vacua	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Maxime Gabella, Yang-Hui He, Andre Lukas	Abstract:  We explicitly construct the largest dataset to date of heterotic vacua arising from stable vector bundles on Calabi-Yau threefolds. Focusing on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds with spectral cover bundles, we show that the number of heterotic models with non-zero number of generations is finite. We classify these models according to the complex base of their Calabi-Yau threefold and to the unification gauge group that they preserve in four dimensions. This database of the order of $10^7$ models, which includes potential Standard Model candidates, is subjected to some preliminary statistical analyses. The additional constraint that there should be three net generations of particles gives a dramatic reduction of the number of vacua. 
0808.02143	Tidal disruption and ignition of white dwarfs by moderately massive black holes	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Rosswog, E. Ramirez-Ruiz, R. Hix	Abstract:  We present a numerical investigation of the tidal disruption of white dwarfs by moderately massive black holes, with particular reference to the centers of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters. Special attention is given to the fate of white dwarfs of all masses that approach the black hole close enough to be disrupted and severely compressed to such extent that explosive nuclear burning can be triggered. Consistent modeling of the gas dynamics together with the nuclear reactions allows for a realistic determination of the explosive energy release. In the most favorable cases, the nuclear energy release may be comparable to that of typical type Ia supernovae. Although the explosion will increase the mass fraction escaping on hyperbolic orbits, a good fraction of the debris remains to be swallowed by the hole, causing a bright soft X-ray flare lasting for about a year. Such transient signatures, if detected, would be a compelling testimony for the presence of a moderately mass black hole (below $10^5 M_\odot$). 
0808.02144	Flow Results and Hints of Incomplete Thermalization	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:Aihong Tang (for the STAR Collaboration)    	Abstract:  We classified $v_2$ measurements according to their sensitivities w.r.t. to two planes, namely, reaction plane and participant plane. Likewise, in $v_2/ε$ scaling, we showed that one needs to choose a $ε$ that is sensitive to the same plane as that $v_2$ is sensitive to. We presented our $v_2/ε$ as a function of centrality and transverse momentum. We studied the ratio of $v_4/v_2^2$. We discussed the applicable range for hydrodynamics, as well as implications to an incomplete thermalization. 
0808.02145	Harmonic oscillator eigenfunction expansions, quantum dots, and effective interactions	Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)	Authors:Simen Kvaal	Abstract:  We give a thorough analysis of the convergence properties of the configuration-interaction method as applied to parabolic quantum dots among other systems, including \emph{a priori} error estimates. The method converges slowly in general, and in order to overcome this, we propose to use an effective two-body interaction well-known from nuclear physics. Through numerical experiments we demonstrate a significant increase in accuracy of the configuration interaction method. 
0808.02146	Superintegrability of the Caged Anisotropic Oscillator	Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)	Authors:N.W. Evans (Cambridge), P.E. Verrier (Cambridge)    	Abstract:  We study "the Caged Anisotropic Harmonic Oscillator", which is a new example of a superintegrable, or accidentally degenerate Hamiltonian. The potential is that of the harmonic oscillator with rational frequency ratio (l:m:n), but additionally with barrier terms describing repulsive forces from the principal planes. This confines the classical motion to a sector bounded by the principal planes, or cage. In 3 degrees, there are five isolating integrals of motion, ensuring that all bound trajectories are closed and strictly periodic. Three of the integrals are quadratic in the momenta, the remaining two are polynomials of order 2(l+m-1) and 2(l+n-1). In the quantum problem, the eigenstates are multiply degenerate, exhibiting multiple copies of the fundamental pattern of the symmetry group SU(3). 
0808.02147	Tuning the Charge Density Wave and Superconductivity in CuxTaS2	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:K.E. Wagner, E. Morosan, Y. S. Hor, J. Tao, Y. Zhu, T. Sanders, T.M. McQueen, H.W. Zandbergen, A. J. Williams, D.V. West, R.J. Cava	Abstract:  We report the characterization of layered, 2H-type CuxTaS2, for x between 0 and 0.12. The charge density wave (CDW), at 70 K for TaS2, is destabilized with Cu doping. The sub-1K superconducting transition in undoped 2H-TaS2 jumps quickly to 2.5 K at low x, increases to 4.5 K at the optimal composition Cu0.04TaS2, and then decreases at higher x. The electronic contribution to the specific heat, first increasing and then decreasing as a function of Cu content, is 12 mJ mol-1 K-2 at Cu0.04TaS2. Electron diffraction studies show that the CDW remains present at the optimal superconducting composition, but with both a changed q vector and decreased coherence length. We present an electronic phase diagram for the system. 
0808.02148	Post Common Envelope Binaries from SDSS - III. Seven new orbital periods	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A.Rebassa-Mansergas, B.T.Gaensicke, M.R.Schreiber, J.Southworth, A.D.Schwope, A.Nebot Gomez-Moran, A.Aungwerojwit, P.Rodriguez-Gil, V.Karamanavis, M.Krumpe, E.Tremou, R.Schwarz, A.Staude, J. Vogel	Abstract:  We present follow-up spectroscopy and photometry of 11 post common envelope binary (PCEB) candidates identified from multiple Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopy in an earlier paper. Radial velocity measurements using the \Lines{Na}{I}{8183.27,8194.81} absorption doublet were performed for nine of these systems and provided measurements of six orbital periods in the range $\Porb= 2.7-17.4$ h. Three PCEB candidates did not show significant radial velocity variations in the follow-up data, and we discuss the implications for the use of SDSS spectroscopy alone to identify PCEBs. Differential photometry confirmed one of our spectroscopic orbital periods and provided one additional \Porb measurement. Binary parameters are estimated for the seven objects for which we have measured the orbital period and the radial velocity amplitude of the low-mass companion star, $K_\mathrm{sec}$. So far, we have published nine SDSS PCEBs orbital periods, all of them $\Porb<1$ d. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations and show that $3σ$ SDSS radial velocity variations should still be detectable for systems in the orbital period range of $\Porb\sim1-10$ days. Consequently, our results suggest that the number of PCEBs decreases considerably for $\Porb>1$ day, and that during the common envelope phase the orbital energy of the binary star is maybe less efficiently used to expell the envelope than frequently assumed. 
0808.02149	Entangled state for constructing generalized phase space representation and its statistical behavior	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Li-yun Hu, Hong-yi Fan	Abstract:  Based on the conception of quantum entanglement of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen we construct generalized phase space representation associated with the entangled state |Gamma>_{e}, which is endowed with definite physical meaning. The set of states make up a complete and non-orthogonal representation. The Weyl ordered form of |Gamma>_{ee}_<Gamma| is derived which clearly exhibit the statistical behavior of marginal distribution of |Gamma>_{ee}_<Gamma|.The minimum uncertainty relation obeyed by |Gamma>_{e} is also demonstrated. 
0808.02150	On the Renormalization of Theories of a Scalar Chiral Superfield	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Oliver J. Rosten	Abstract:  An exact renormalization group for theories of a scalar chiral superfield is formulated, directly in four dimensional Euclidean space. By constructing a projector which isolates the superpotential from the full Wilsonian effective action, it is shown that the nonperturbative nonrenormalization theorem follows, quite simply, from the flow equation. Next, it is argued that there do not exist any physically acceptable non-trivial fixed points. Finally, the Wess-Zumino model is considered, as a low energy effective theory. Following an evaluation of the one and two loop beta-function coefficients, to illustrate the ease of use of the formalism, it is shown that the beta-function in the massless case does not receive any nonperturbative power corrections. 
0808.02151	Single-particle spectral function for the classical one-component plasma	Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)	Authors:Carsten Fortmann	Abstract:  The spectral function for an electron one-component plasma is calculated self-consistently using the GW0 approximation for the single-particle self-energy. In this way, correlation effects which go beyond the mean-field description of the plasma are contained, i.e. the collisional damping of single-particle states, the dynamical screening of the interaction and the appearance of collective plasma modes. Secondly, a novel non-perturbative analytic solution for the on-shell GW0 self-energy as a function of momentum is presented. It reproduces the numerical data for the spectral function with a relative error of less than 10% in the regime where the Debye screening parameter is smaller than the inverse Bohr radius, kappa<1/a_B. In the limit of low density, the non-perturbative self-energy behaves as n^(1/4), whereas a perturbation expansion leads to the unphysical result of a density independent self-energy [W. Fennel and H. P. Wilfer, Ann. Phys. Lpz._32_, 265 (1974)]. The derived expression will greatly facilitate the calculation of observables in correlated plasmas (transport properties, equation of state) that need the spectral function as an input quantity. This is demonstrated for the shift of the chemical potential, which is computed from the analytical formulae and compared to the GW0-result. At a plasma temperature of 100 eV and densities below 10^21 cm^-3, both approaches deviate less than 10% from each other. 
0808.02152	High-dimensional Gaussian model selection on a Gaussian design	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Nicolas Verzelen (LM-Orsay, INRIA Saclay - Ile de France)    	Abstract:  We consider the problem of estimating the conditional mean of a real Gaussian variable $\nolinebreak Y=\sum_{i=1}^p\nolinebreakθ_iX_i+\nolinebreak ε$ where the vector of the covariates $(X_i)_{1\leq i\leq p}$ follows a joint Gaussian distribution. This issue often occurs when one aims at estimating the graph or the distribution of a Gaussian graphical model. We introduce a general model selection procedure which is based on the minimization of a penalized least-squares type criterion. It handles a variety of problems such as ordered and complete variable selection, allows to incorporate some prior knowledge on the model and applies when the number of covariates $p$ is larger than the number of observations $n$. Moreover, it is shown to achieve a non-asymptotic oracle inequality independently of the correlation structure of the covariates. We also exhibit various minimax rates of estimation in the considered framework and hence derive adaptiveness properties of our procedure. 
0808.02153	Angular Momentum Projected Configuration Interaction with Realistic Hamiltonians	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Zaochun Gao, Mihai Horoi	Abstract:  The Projected Configuration Interaction (PCI) method starts from a collection of mean-field wave functions, and builds up correlated wave functions of good symmetry. It relies on the Generator Coordinator Method (GCM) techniques, but it improves the past approaches by a very efficient method of selecting the basis states. We use the same realistic Hamiltonians and model spaces as the Configuration Interaction (CI) method, and compare the results with the full CI calculations in the sd and pf shell. Examples of 24Mg, 28Si, 48Cr, 52Fe and 56Ni are discussed. 
0808.02154	Wilson lines - color charge densities correlators and the production of eta' in the CGC for pp and pA collisions	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Francois Fillion-Gourdeau, Sangyong Jeon	Abstract:  We compute the inclusive differential cross section production of the pseudo-scalar meson eta' in high-energy proton-proton (pp) and proton-nucleus (pA) collisions. We use an effective coupling between gluons and eta' meson to derive a reduction formula that relates the eta' production to a field-strength tensor correlator. For pA collisions we take into account saturation effects on the nucleus side by using the Color Glass Condensate formalism to evaluate this correlator. We derive new results for Wilson line - color charges correlators in the McLerran-Venugopalan model needed in the computation of eta' production. The unintegrated parton distribution functions are used to characterize the gluon distribution inside protons. We show that in pp collisions, the cross section depends on the parametrization of unintegrated parton distribution functions and thus, it can be used to put constraints on these distributions. We also demonstrate that in pA collisions, the cross section is sensitive to saturation effects so it can be utilized to estimate the value of the saturation scale. 
0808.02155	Supertwistors, massive superparticles and k-symmetry	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:J.A. de Azcarraga, J.M. Izquierdo, J. Lukierski	Abstract:  We consider a D=4 two-twistor lagrangian for a massive particle that incorporates the mass-shell condition in an algebraic way, and extend it to a two-supertwistor model with N=2 supersymmetry and central charge identified with the mass. In the purely supertwistorial picture the two D=4 supertwistors are coupled through a Wess-Zumino term in their fermionic sector. We demonstrate how the kappa-gauge symmetry appears in the purely supertwistorial formulation and reduces by half the fermionic degrees of freedom of the two supertwistors; a formulation of the model in terms of kappa-invariant degrees of freedom is also obtained. We show that the kappa-invariant supertwistor coordinates can be obtained by dimensional (D=6 -> D=4) reduction from a D=6 supertwistor. We derive as well by 6 -> 4 reduction the N=2, D=4 massive superparticle model with Wess-Zumino term introduced in 1982. Finally, we comment on general superparticle models constructed with more than two supertwistors. 
0808.02156	Estimating stellar rotation from starspot detection during planetary transits	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Adriana Silva-Valio	Abstract:  A new method for determining the stellar rotation period is proposed here, based on the detection of starspots during transits of an extra-solar planet orbiting its host star. As the planet eclipses the star, it may pass in front of a starspot which will then make itself known through small flux variations in the transit light curve. If we are lucky enough to catch the same spot on two consecutive transits, it is possible to estimate the stellar rotational period. This method is successfully tested on transit simulations on the Sun yielding the correct value for the solar period. By detecting two starspots on more than one transit of HD 209458 observed by the Hubble Space Telescope, it was possible to estimate a period of either 9.9 or 11.4 days for the star, depending on which spot is responsible for the signature in the light curve a few transits later. Comparison with period estimates of HD209458 reported in the literature indicates that 11.4 days is the most likely stellar rotation period. 
0808.02157	Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics -- a Particle-Based Mesoscale Simulation Approach to the Hydrodynamics of Complex Fluids	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:G. Gompper, T. Ihle, D.M. Kroll, R.G. Winkler	Abstract:  In this review, we describe and analyze a mesoscale simulation method for fluid flow, which was introduced by Malevanets and Kapral in 1999, and is now called multi-particle collision dynamics (MPC) or stochastic rotation dynamics (SRD). The method consists of alternating streaming and collision steps in an ensemble of point particles. The multi-particle collisions are performed by grouping particles in collision cells, and mass, momentum, and energy are locally conserved. This simulation technique captures both full hydrodynamic interactions and thermal fluctuations. The first part of the review begins with a description of several widely used MPC algorithms and then discusses important features of the original SRD algorithm and frequently used variations. Two complementary approaches for deriving the hydrodynamic equations and evaluating the transport coefficients are reviewed. It is then shown how MPC algorithms can be generalized to model non-ideal fluids, and binary mixtures with a consolute point. The importance of angular-momentum conservation for systems like phase-separated liquids with different viscosities is discussed. The second part of the review describes a number of recent applications of MPC algorithms to study colloid and polymer dynamics, the behavior of vesicles and cells in hydrodynamic flows, and the dynamics of viscoelastic fluids. 
0808.02158	Parallel calibrations and minimal submanifolds	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:C. Robles	Abstract:  Given a parallel calibration $φ\in Ω^p(M)$ on a Riemannian manifold $M$, I prove that the $φ$--critical submanifolds with nonzero critical value are minimal submanifolds. I also show that the $φ$--critical submanifolds are precisely the integral manifolds of a $\mathscr{C}^\infty(M)$--linear subspace $\sP \subset Ω^p(M)$. In particular, the calibrated submanifolds are necessarily integral submanifolds of the system. (Examples of parallel calibrations include the special Lagrangian calibration on Calabi-Yau manifolds, (co)associative calibrations on $G_2$--manifolds, and the Cayley calibration on $\tSpin(7)$--manifolds.) 
0808.02159	NTT follow-up observations of star cluster candidates from the FSR catalogue	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:D. Froebrich (1), H. Meusinger (2), A. Scholz (3) ((1) University of Kent, (2) Thueringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg, (3) University of St. Andrews)    	Abstract:  We are conducting a large program to classify newly discovered Milky Way star cluster candidates from the list of Froebrich, Scholz & Raftery (2007). Here we present deep NIR follow-up observations from ESO/NTT of 14 star cluster candidates. We show that the combined analysis of star density maps and colour-colour/magnitude diagrams derived from deep near-infrared imaging is a viable tool to reliably classify new stellar clusters. This allowed us to identify two young clusters with massive stars, three intermediate age open clusters, and two globular cluster candidates among our targets. The remaining seven objects are unlikely to be stellar clusters. Among them is the object FSR1767 which has previously been identified as a globular cluster using 2MASS data by Bonatto et al. (2007). Our new analysis shows that FSR1767 is not a star cluster. We also summarise the currently available follow-up analysis of the FSR candidates and conclude that this catalogue may contain a large number of new stellar clusters, probably dominated by old open clusters. 
0808.02160	Local energy estimates for the finite element method on sharply varying grids	Numerical Analysis (math.NA)	Authors:Alan Demlow, Johnny Guzman, Alfred H. Schatz	Abstract:  Local energy error estimates for the finite element method for elliptic problems were originally proved in 1974 by Nitsche and Schatz. These estimates show that the local energy error may be bounded by a local approximation term, plus a global "pollution" term that measures the influence of solution quality from outside the domain of interest and is heuristically of higher order. However, the original analysis of Nitsche and Schatz is restricted to quasi-uniform grids. We present local a priori energy estimates that are valid on shape regular grids, an assumption which allows for highly graded meshes and which much more closely matches the typical practical situation. Our chief technical innovation is an improved superapproximation result. 
0808.02161	Search for Doubly Charged Higgs Bosons with Lepton-Flavor-Violating Decays involving Tau Leptons	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:CDF Collaboration	Abstract:  We search for pair production of doubly charged Higgs particles followed by decays into electron-tau and muon-tau pairs using data (350 inverse picobarns) collected from proton-antiproton collisions at 1.96 TeV by the CDF II experiment. We search separately for cases where three or four final-state leptons are detected, and combine results for exclusive decays to left-handed electron-tau (muon-tau) pairs. We set a lower mass limit of 114 (112) GeV/cc at the 95% confidence level for left-handed doubly charged Higgs. 
0808.02162	Tangent Cone of Numerical Semigroup Rings of Embedding Dimension Three	Commutative Algebra (math.AC)	Authors:Yi-Huang Shen	Abstract:  In this paper, we give new characterizations of the Buchsbaum and Cohen-Macaulay properties of the tangent cone $\gr_\frakm(R)$, where $(R,\frakm)$ is a numerical semigroup ring of embedding dimension 3. In particular, we confirm the conjectures raised by Sapko on the Buchsbaumness of $\gr_\frakm(R)$. 
0808.02163	The relativistic Scott correction for atoms and molecules	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Jan Philip Solovej (University of Copenhagen, DK), Thomas Østergaard Sørensen (Aalborg University, DK), Wolfgang L. Spitzer (University of Erlangen, D)    	Abstract:  We prove the first correction to the leading Thomas-Fermi energy for the ground state energy of atoms and molecules in a model where the kinetic energy of the electrons is treated relativistically. The leading Thomas-Fermi energy, established in [Sorensen], as well as the correction given here are of semi-classical nature. Our result on atoms and molecules is proved from a general semi-classical estimate for relativistic operators with potentials with Coulomb-like singularities. This semi-classical estimate is obtained using the coherent state calculus introduced in [Solovej-Spitzer]. The paper contains a unified treatment of the relativistic as well as the non-relativistic case. 
0808.02164	Electron screening and excitonic condensation in double-layer graphene systems	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Maxim Yu. Kharitonov, Konstantin B. Efetov	Abstract:  We theoretically investigate the possibility of excitonic condensation in a system of two graphene monolayers separated by an insulator, in which electrons and holes in the layers are induced by external gates. In contrast to the recent studies of this system, we take into account the screening of the interlayer Coulomb interaction by the carriers in the layers, and this drastically changes the result. Due to a large number of electron species in the system (two projections of spin, two valleys, and two layers) and to the suppression of backscattering in graphene, the maximum possible strength of the screened Coulomb interaction appears to be quite small making the weak-coupling treatment applicable. We calculate the mean-field transition temperature for a clean system and demonstrate that its highest possible value $T_c^\text{max}\sim 10^{-7}ε_F\lesssim 1 \text{mK}$ is extremely small ($ε_F$ is the Fermi energy). In addition, any sufficiently short-range disorder with the scattering time $τ\lesssim \hbar /T_c^\text{max}$ would suppress the condensate completely. Our findings renders experimental observation of excitonic condensation in the above setup improbable even at very low temperatures. 
0808.02165	Higher dimensional Kerr-Schild spacetimes	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Marcello Ortaggio, Vojtech Pravda, Alena Pravdova	Abstract:  We investigate general properties of Kerr-Schild (KS) metrics in n>4 spacetime dimensions. First, we show that the Weyl tensor is of type II or more special if the null KS vector k is geodetic (or, equivalently, if T_{ab}k^ak^b=0). We subsequently specialize to vacuum KS solutions, which naturally split into two families of non-expanding and expanding metrics. After demonstrating that non-expanding solutions are equivalent to the known class of vacuum Kundt solutions of type N, we analyze expanding solutions in detail. We show that they can only be of the type II or D, and we characterize optical properties of the multiple Weyl aligned null direction (WAND) k. In general, k has caustics corresponding to curvature singularities. In addition, it is generically shearing. Nevertheless, we arrive at a possible "weak" n>4 extension of the Goldberg-Sachs theorem, limited to the KS class, which matches previous conclusions for general type III/N solutions. In passing, properties of Myers-Perry black holes and black rings related to our results are also briefly discussed. 
0808.02166	Barrier crossing to the small Holstein polaron regime	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:P. Hamm, G. P. Tsironis	Abstract:  We investigate the dimensionality effects of the Holstein polaron from the fully quantum regime, where the crossover between large and small polaron solutions is known to be continuous in all dimensions, into the limit described by the semiclassical Discrete Nonlinear Schrödinger (DNLS) Equation, where the crossover is continuous in 1D but discontinuous in higher dimensions. We use exact numerics on one hand and a two variable parametrization of the Toyozawa ansatz on the other in order to probe the crossover region in all parameter regimes. We find that a barrier appears also in 1D separating the two types of solutions, seemingly in contradiction to the common paradigm for the DNLS according to which the crossover is barrier-free. We quantify the polaron behavior in the crossover region as a function of the exciton overlap and find that the barrier remains small in 1D and tunnelling through it is not rate-limiting. 
0808.02167	First Direct Bound on the Total Width of the Top Quark in ppbar Collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:CDF Collaboration: T. Aaltonen, et al    	Abstract:  We present the first direct experimental bound on the total decay width of the top quark using 955pb^-1 of the Tevatron's ppbar collisions recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab. We identify 253 top-antitop pair candidate events. The distribution of reconstructed top quark mass from these events is fitted to templates representing different values of the top quark width. Using a confidence interval based on likelihood ratio ordering, we extract an upper limit at 95% C.L. of Gamma_t <13.1 GeV for an assumed top quark mass of 175 GeV/c^2. 
0808.02168	Interstellar Weather Vanes: GLIMPSE Mid-Infrared Stellar-Wind Bowshocks in M17 and RCW49	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Matthew S. Povich, Robert A. Benjamin, Barbara A. Whitney, Brian L. Babler, Remy Indebetouw, Marilyn R. Meade, Ed Churchwell	Abstract:  We report the discovery of six infrared stellar-wind bowshocks in the Galactic massive star formation regions M17 and RCW49 from Spitzer GLIMPSE (Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire) images. The InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) on the Spitzer Space Telescope clearly resolves the arc-shaped emission produced by the bowshocks. We combine Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS), Spitzer, MSX, and IRAS observations to obtain the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the bowshocks and their individual driving stars. We use the stellar SEDs to estimate the spectral types of the three newly-identified O stars in RCW49 and one previously undiscovered O star in M17. One of the bowshocks in RCW49 reveals the presence of a large-scale flow of gas escaping the H II region at a few 10^2 km/s. Radiation-transfer modeling of the steep rise in the SED of this bowshock toward longer mid-infrared wavelengths indicates that the emission is coming principally from dust heated by the star driving the shock. The other 5 bowshocks occur where the stellar winds of O stars sweep up dust in the expanding H II regions. 
0808.02169	Étale cohomology, Lefschetz Theorems and Number of Points of Singular Varieties over Finite Fields	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Sudhir R. Ghorpade, Gilles Lachaud	Abstract:  We prove a general inequality for estimating the number of points of arbitrary complete intersections over a finite field. This extends a result of Deligne for nonsingular complete intersections. For normal complete intersections, this inequality generalizes also the classical Lang-Weil inequality. Moreover, we prove the Lang-Weil inequality for affine as well as projective varieties with an explicit description and a bound for the constant appearing therein. We also prove a conjecture of Lang and Weil concerning the Picard varieties and étale cohomology spaces of projective varieties. The general inequality for complete intersections may be viewed as a more precise version of the estimates given by Hooley and Katz. The proof is primarily based on a suitable generalization of the Weak Lefschetz Theorem to singular varieties together with some Bertini-type arguments and the Grothendieck-Lefschetz Trace Formula. We also describe some auxiliary results concerning the étale cohomology spaces and Betti numbers of projective varieties over finite fields and a conjecture along with some partial results concerning the number of points of projective algebraic sets over finite fields. 
0808.02170	Theory of possible effects of the Allee phenomenon on refugia of the Hantavirus epidemic	Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO)	Authors:Niraj Kumar, M. N. Kuperman, V. M. Kenkre	Abstract:  We investigate possible effects of high order nonlinearities on the shapes of infection refugia of the Hantavirus epidemic. We replace Fisher-like equations that have been recently used to describe Hantavirus spread in mouse populations by generalizations capable of describing Allee effects that are a consequence of the high order nonlinearities. We analyze the equations to calculate steady state solutions. We study the stability of those solutions under physical conditions and compare to the earlier Fisher-like case. We consider spatial modulation of the environment and find that unexpected results appear, including a bifurcation that has not been studied before. 
0808.02171	Magneto-Optical Trap for Polar Molecules	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:Benjamin K. Stuhl, Brian C. Sawyer, Dajun Wang, Jun Ye	Abstract:  We propose a method for laser cooling and trapping a substantial class of polar molecules, and in particular titanium (II) oxide (TiO). This method uses pulsed electric fields to nonadiabatically remix the ground-state magnetic sublevels of the molecule, allowing us to build a magneto-optical trap (MOT) based on a quasi-cycling $J'=J"-1$ transition. Monte-Carlo simulations of this electrostatically remixed MOT (ER-MOT) demonstrate the feasibility of cooling TiO to a temperature of 10 $\mathrmμK$ and trapping it with a radiation-pumping-limited lifetime on the order of 80 ms. 
0808.02172	The Continuous Graph FFT	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Robert Carlson (University of Colorado at Colorado Springs)    	Abstract:  The discrete Fourier transform and the FFT algorithm are extended from the circle to continuous graphs with equal edge lengths. 
0808.02173	The local recognition of reflection graphs of spherical Coxeter groups	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Ralf Köhl, Jonathan I. Hall, Armin Straub	Abstract:  Based on the third author's thesis in this article we complete the local recognition of commuting reflection graphs of spherical Coxeter groups arising from irreducible crystallographic root systems. 
0808.02174	Group Averaging of massless scalar fields in 1+1 de Sitter	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Donald Marolf, Ian A. Morrison	Abstract:  Perturbative gravity in global de Sitter space is subject to so-called linearization stability constraints: If they are to couple consistently to the gravitational field, quantum states must be invariant under the de Sitter isometries. While standard Fock spaces contain no de Sitter-invariant states apart from (possibly) the vacuum, a full Hilbert space of de Sitter-invariant quantum states can be constructed via group averaging techiniques. We re-examine the simple toy model of de Sitter group averaging given by the free 1+1 scalar field, expanding on an earlier analysis by Higuchi. Our purpose is twofold: to include the scalar zero-mode, and to explicitly count the number of de Sitter-invariant states as a function of an appropriately defined energy. 
0808.02175	Study of singular radius and surface boundary constraints in refractive beam shaper design	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:C. Liu, S. Zhang	Abstract:  This paper presents analysis of important issues associated with the design of refractive laser beam shaping systems. The concept of singular radius is introduced along with solutions to minimize its adverse effect on shaper performance. In addition, the surface boundary constraint is discussed in detail. This study provides useful guidelines to circumvent possible design errors that would degrade the shaper quality or add undesired complication to the system. 
0808.02176	Resonance parameters from K-matrix and T-matrix poles	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:R.L. Workman, R.A. Arndt, M. Paris	Abstract:  We extract K-matrix poles from our fits to elastic pion-nucleon scattering and eta-nucleon production data in order to test a recently proposed method for the determination of resonance properties, based on the trace of the K-matrix. We have considered issues associated with the separation of background and resonance contributions, the correspondence between K-matrix and T-matrix poles, and the complicated behavior of eigenphases. 
0808.02177	Symmetries and modelling functions for diffusion processes	Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)	Authors:A.G. Nikitin, S.V. Spichak, Yu. S. Vedula, A.G. Naumovets	Abstract:  A constructive approach to theory of diffusion processes is proposed, which is based on application of both the symmetry analysis and method of modelling functions. An algorithm for construction of the modelling functions is suggested. This algorithm is based on the error functions expansion (ERFEX) of experimental concentration profiles. The high-accuracy analytical description of the profiles provided by ERFEX approximation allows a convenient extraction of the concentration dependence of diffusivity from experimental data and prediction of the diffusion process. Our analysis is exemplified by its employment to experimental results obtained for surface diffusion of lithium on the molybdenum (112) surface pre-covered with dysprosium. The ERFEX approximation can be directly extended to many other diffusion systems. 
0808.02178	Local Causality and Completeness: Bell vs. Jarrett	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Travis Norsen	Abstract:  J.S. Bell believed that his famous theorem entailed a deep and troubling conflict between the empirically verified predictions of quantum theory and the notion of local causality that is motivated by relativity theory. Yet many physicists continue to accept, usually on the reports of textbook writers and other commentators, that Bell's own view was wrong, and that, in fact, the theorem only brings out a conflict with determinism or the hidden-variables program or realism or some other such principle that (unlike local causality), allegedly, nobody should have believed anyway. (Moreover, typically such beliefs arise without the person in question even being aware that the view they are accepting differs so radically from Bell's own.) Here we try to shed some light on the situation by focusing on the concept of local causality that is the heart of Bell's theorem, and, in particular, by contrasting Bell's own understanding with the analysis of Jon Jarrett which has been the most influential source, in recent decades, for the kinds of claims mentioned previously. We point out a crucial difference between Jarrett's and Bell's own understanding of Bell's formulation of local causality, which turns out to be the basis for the erroneous claim, made by Jarrett and many others, that Bell misunderstood the implications of his own theorem. 
0808.02179	Magnetic Reconnection by a Self-Retreating X-Line	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Oka, M. Fujimoto, T. K. M. Nakamura, I. Shinohara, K.-I. Nishikawa	Abstract:  Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of collisionless magnetic reconnection are performed to study asymmetric reconnection in which an outflow is blocked by a hard wall while leaving sufficiently large room for the outflow of the opposite direction. This condition leads to a slow, roughly constant motion of the diffusion region away from the wall, the so-called `X-line retreat'. The typical retreat speed is ~0.1 times the Alfven speed. At the diffusion region, ion flow pattern shows strong asymmetry and the ion stagnation point and the X-line are not collocated. A surprise, however, is that the reconnection rate remains the same unaffected by the retreat motion. 
0808.02180	Metallicity-corrected Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distance to NGC 4258	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Violet A. Mager, Barry F. Madore, Wendy L. Freedman	Abstract:  We have determined the distance to NGC 4258 using observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Wide Field, Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS/WFC). We apply a modified technique that fully accounts for metallicity effects on the use of the luminosity of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) to determine one of the most precise TRGB distance moduli to date: u(TRGB) = 29.28 +/- 0.04 (random) +/- 0.12 (systematic) mag (7.18 +/- 0.13 +/- 0.40 Mpc). We discuss this distance modulus with respect to other recent applications of the TRGB method to NGC 4258, and with several other techniques (Cepheids and masers) that are equally competitive in their precision, but different in their systematics. 
0808.02181	Spectrum Sharing Between Cellular and Mobile Ad Hoc Networks: Transmission-Capacity Trade-Off	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Kaibin Huang, Vincent K. N. Lau, Yan Chen	Abstract:  Spectrum sharing between wireless networks improves the efficiency of spectrum usage, and thereby alleviates spectrum scarcity due to growing demands for wireless broadband access. To improve the usual underutilization of the cellular uplink spectrum, this paper studies spectrum sharing between a cellular uplink and a mobile ad hoc networks. These networks access either all frequency sub-channels or their disjoint sub-sets, called spectrum underlay and spectrum overlay, respectively. Given these spectrum sharing methods, the capacity trade-off between the coexisting networks is analyzed based on the transmission capacity of a network with Poisson distributed transmitters. This metric is defined as the maximum density of transmitters subject to an outage constraint for a given signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). Using tools from stochastic geometry, the transmission-capacity trade-off between the coexisting networks is analyzed, where both spectrum overlay and underlay as well as successive interference cancelation (SIC) are considered. In particular, for small target outage probability, the transmission capacities of the coexisting networks are proved to satisfy a linear equation, whose coefficients depend on the spectrum sharing method and whether SIC is applied. This linear equation shows that spectrum overlay is more efficient than spectrum underlay. Furthermore, this result also provides insight into the effects of different network parameters on transmission capacities, including link diversity gains, transmission distances, and the base station density. In particular, SIC is shown to increase transmission capacities of both coexisting networks by a linear factor, which depends on the interference-power threshold for qualifying canceled interferers. 
0808.02182	Ergodic theory and visualization. II. Harmonic mesochronic plots visualize (quasi)periodic sets	Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)	Authors:Zoran Levnajić, Igor Mezić	Abstract:  We present a new method of analysis of measure-preserving dynamical systems, based on frequency analysis and ergodic theory, which extends our earlier work [1]. Our method employs the novel concept of harmonic time average [2], and is realized as a computational algorithms for visualization of periodic and quasi-periodic sets or arbitrary periodicity in the phase space. Besides identifying all periodic sets, our method is useful in detecting chaotic phase space regions with a good precision. The range of method's applicability is illustrated using well-known Chirikov standard map, while its full potential is presented by studying higher-dimensional measure-preserving systems, in particular Froeschlé map and extended standard map.

Hoblit, A.M. Sandorfi, K. Ardashev, C. Bade, O. Bartalini, M. Blecher, A. Caracappa, A. D'Angelo, A. d'Angelo, R. Di Salvo, A. Fantini, C. Gibson, H. Glueckler, K. Hicks, A. Honig, T. Kageya, M. Khandaker, O.C. Kistner, S. Kizilgul, S. Kucuker, A. Lehmann, M. Lowry, M. Lucas, J. Mahon, L. Miceli, D. Moricciani, B. Norum, M. Pap, B. Preedom, H. Seyfarth, C. Schaerf, H. Stroeher, C.E. Thorn, C.S. Whisnant, K. Wang, X. Wei	Abstract:  We report new measurements of inclusive pion production from frozen-spin HD for polarized photon beams covering the Delta(1232) resonance. These provide data simultaneously on both H and D with nearly complete angular distributions of the spin-difference cross sections entering the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn (GDH) sum rule. Recent results from Mainz and Bonn exceed the GDH prediction for the proton by 22 microbarns, suggesting as yet unmeasured high-energy components. Our pi0 data reveal a different angular dependence than assumed in Mainz analyses and integrate to a value that is 18 microbarns lower, suggesting a more rapid convergence. Our results for deuterium are somewhat lower than published data, considerably more precise and generally lower than available calculations. 
0808.02184	Supersymmetric Multi-trace Boundary Conditions in AdS	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Aaron J. Amsel, Donald Marolf	Abstract:  Boundary conditions for massive fermions are investigated in AdS_d for $d \ge 2$. For fermion masses in the range $0 \le |m| < 1/2\ell$ with $\ell$ the AdS length, the standard notion of normalizeability allows a choice of boundary conditions. As in the case of scalars at or slightly above the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound, such boundary conditions correspond to multi-trace deformations of any CFT dual. By constructing appropriate boundary superfields, for d=3,4,5 we identify joint scalar/fermion boundary conditions which preserve either ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry or ${\cal N}=1$ superconformal symmetry on the boundary. In particular, we identify boundary conditions corresponding via AdS/CFT (at large N) to a 595-parameter family of double-trace marginal deformations of the low-energy theory of N M2-branes which preserve ${\cal N} =1$ superconformal symmetry. We also establish that (at large N and large 't Hooft coupling $λ$) there are no marginal or relevant multi-trace deformations of 3+1 ${\cal N} =4$ super Yang-Mills which preserve even ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry. 
0808.02185	Tightly-bound Cooper pair, quasiparticle kinks and clues on the pairing potential in a high Tc FeAs Superconductor	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:L. Wray, D. Qian, D. Hsieh, Y. Xia, L. Li, J.G. Checkelsky, A. Pasupathy, K.K. Gomes, A.V. Fedorov, G.F. Chen, J.L. Luo, A. Yazdani, N.P. Ong, N.L. Wang, M.Z. Hasan	Abstract:  We present a systematic photoemission study of the newly discovered high Tc superconductor class (Sr/Ba)1-xKxFe2As2. By utilizing a unique photon energy range and scattering geometry we resolve the details of the single particle dynamics of interacting electrons on the central Fermi surfaces of this series which shows overall strong coupling behavior (2D/kBTc = 6). Quasiparticle dispersion kinks are observed in a binding energy range of 15 to 50 meV which matches the magnetic excitation energy scales (parameterized by J1,J2). The size of the Cooper pair wavefunction is found to be less than 20A indicating a short in-plane scale uncharacteristic of a BCS-phonon scenario but suggestive of a phase factor in the global order parameter. The kink likely reflects contributions from the strongly frustrated fluctuating spin excitations and the soft phonons around 20-40 meV. Our results provide important clue to the nature of the pairing potential realized in these superconductors. 
0808.02186	Jamming I: A volume function for jammed matter	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Chaoming Song, Ping Wang, Yuliang Jin, Hernan A. Makse	Abstract:  We introduce a "Hamiltonian"-like function, called the volume function, indispensable to describe the ensemble of jammed matter such as granular materials and emulsions from a geometrical point of view. The volume function represents the available volume of each particle in the jammed systems. At the microscopic level, we show that the volume function is the Voronoi volume associated to each particle and in turn we provide an analytical formula for the Voronoi volume in terms of the contact network, valid for any dimension. We then develop a statistical theory for the probability distribution of the volumes in 3d to calculate an average volume function coarse-grained at a mesoscopic level. The salient result is the discovery of a mesoscopic volume function inversely proportional to the coordination number. Our analysis is the first step toward the calculation of macroscopic observables and equations of state using the statistical mechanics of jammed matter, when supplemented by the condition of mechanical equilibrium of jamming that properly defines jammed matter at the ensemble level. 
0808.02187	Ab-initio shell model with a core	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:A. F. Lisetskiy, B. R. Barrett, M. K. G. Kruse, P. Navratil, I. Stetcu, J. P. Vary	Abstract:  We construct effective 2- and 3-body Hamiltonians for the p-shell by performing 12\hbarΩab initio no-core shell model (NCSM) calculations for A=6 and 7 nuclei and explicitly projecting the many-body Hamiltonians onto the 0\hbarΩspace. We then separate these effective Hamiltonians into 0-, 1- and 2-body contributions (also 3-body for A=7) and analyze the systematic behavior of these different parts as a function of the mass number A and size of the NCSM basis space. The role of effective 3- and higher-body interactions for A>6 is investigated and discussed. 
0808.02188	Interferometric imaging of the high-redshift radio galaxy, 4C60.07: An SMA, Spitzer and VLA study reveals a binary AGN/starburst	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:R.J. Ivison (Edinburgh), G.E. Morrison, A.D. Biggs, Ian Smail, S.P. Willner, M.A. Gurwell, T.R. Greve, J.A. Stevens, M.L.N. Ashby	Abstract:  High-resolution submm imaging of the HzRG, 4C60.07, at z=3.8, has revealed two dusty components. Spitzer imaging shows that one of these components (B) is coincident with an extremely red AGN, offset by ~4" (~30 kpc) from the HzRG core. The other submm component (A) - resolved by our beam and devoid of emission at 3.6-8.0um - lies between B and the HzRG core. Since the HzRG was discovered via its young, steep-spectrum lobes and their creation was likely triggered by the interaction, we argue that we are witnessing an early-stage merger, prior to its eventual equilibrium state. The interaction is between the host galaxy of an actively-fueled BH, and a gas-rich starburst/AGN (B) marked by the compact submm component and coincident with broad CO emission. `A' is a plume of cold, dusty gas, associated with a narrow (~150 km/s) CO feature, and may represent a short-lived tidal structure. It has been claimed that HzRGs and SMGs differ only in the activity of their AGNs, but such complex submm morphologies are seen only rarely amongst SMGs. Our study has important implications: where a galaxy's gas is not aligned with its central BH, CO may be an unreliable probe of dynamical mass, affecting work on the co-assembly of BHs and spheroids. Our data support the picture wherein close binary AGN are induced by mergers. They also raise the possibility that some supposedly jet-induced starbursts may have formed co-evally with (yet independently of) the radio jets, both triggered by the same interaction. We note that the HzRG host would have gone unnoticed without its jets/companion, so there may be many other unseen BHs at high redshift, lost in the sea of ~5 x 10^8 similarly bright IRAC sources - sufficiently massive to drive a >10^27-W radio source, yet practically invisible unless actively fueled (abridged). 
0808.02189	Topological character of hydrodynamic screening in suspensions of hard spheres: an example of universal phenomenon	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Ethan E.Ballard, Arkady L.Kholodenko	Abstract:  Although in the case of polymer solutions the existence of hydrodynamic screening is considered as established, use of the same methods for suspensions of hard spheres so far have failed to produce similar results. In this work we reconsider this problem. Using superposition of topological, combinatorial and London-style qualitative arguments, we prove the existence of screening in suspensions. We show that the nature of hydrodynamic screening in suspensions is analogous to that known for the Meissner effect in superconductors. The extent of screening depends on volume fraction of hard spheres. The zero volume fraction limit corresponds to the normal state. The case of finite volume fractions-to the mixed state typical for superconductors of the second kind. Such a state is becoming fully "superconducting" at some critical volume fraction for which the (zero frequency) relative viscosity diverges. Our analytical results describing this divergence are in accord with known scaling results obtained by Brady and Bicerano et al which are well supported by experimental data. We provide theoretical explanation of the divergence of relative viscosity in terms of a topological-type transition which mathematically can be made isomorphic to the more familiar Bose-Einstein condensation transition. Because of this, the methods developed in this work are not limited to suspensions only. In concluding section we mention other applications of the developed formalism ranging from turbulence and magnetohydrodynamics to high temperature superconductors, QCD, string models, etc. 
0808.02190	Entropy of jammed matter	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Christopher Briscoe, Chaoming Song, Ping Wang, Hernan A. Makse	Abstract:  We investigate the nature of randomness in disordered packings of frictional spheres. We calculate the entropy of 3D packings through the force and volume ensemble of jammed matter, a mesoscopic ensemble and numerical simulations using volume fluctuation analysis and graph theoretical methods. Equations of state are obtained relating entropy, volume fraction and compactivity characterizing the different states of jammed matter. At the mesoscopic level the entropy vanishes at random close packing. The entropy of the jammed system reveals that the random loose packings are more disordered than random close packings, allowing for an unambiguous interpretation of both limits. 
0808.02191	Factorization for generic jet production	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Christian W. Bauer, Andrew Hornig, Frank J. Tackmann	Abstract:  Factorization is the central ingredient in any theoretical prediction for collider experiments. We introduce a factorization formalism that can be applied to any desired observable, like event shapes or jet observables, for any number of jets and a wide range of jet algorithms in leptonic or hadronic collisions. This is achieved by using soft-collinear effective theory to prove the formal factorization of a generic fully-differential cross section in terms of a hard coefficient, and generic jet and soft functions. In this formalism, whether a given observable factorizes in the usual sense, depends on whether it is inclusive enough, so the jet functions can be calculated perturbatively. The factorization formula for any such observable immediately follows from our general result, including the precise definition of the jet and soft functions appropriate for the observable in question. As examples of our formalism, we work out several results in two-jet production for both e+e- and pp collisions. For the latter, we also comment on how our formalism allows one to treat underlying events and beam remnants. 
0808.02192	Jamming in two-dimensional packings	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Sam Meyer, Chaoming Song, Yuliang Jin, Kun Wang, Hernán A. Makse	Abstract:  We investigate the existence of random close and random loose packing limits in two-dimensional packings of monodisperse hard disks. A statistical mechanics approach-- based on several approximations to predict the probability distribution of volumes-- suggests the existence of the limiting densities of the jammed packings according to their coordination number and compactivity. This result has implications for the understanding of disordered states in the disk packing problem as well as the existence of a putative glass transition in two dimensional systems. 
0808.02193	The Exceptionally Luminous Type II-L SN 2008es	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. A. Miller, R. Chornock, D. A. Perley, M. Ganeshalingam, W. Li, N. R. Butler, J. S. Bloom, N. Smith, M. Modjaz, D. Poznanski, A. V. Filippenko, C. V. Griffith, J. H. Shiode, J. M. Silverman (UC Berkeley)    	Abstract:  We report on our early photometric and spectroscopic observations of the extremely luminous Type II supernova (SN) 2008es. With an observed peak optical magnitude of m_V = 17.8 and at a redshift z = 0.213, SN 2008es had a peak absolute magnitude of M_V = -22.3, making it the second most luminous SN ever observed. The photometric evolution of SN 2008es exhibits a fast decline rate (~0.042 mag d^-1), similar to the extremely luminous Type II-L SN 2005ap. We show that SN 2008es spectroscopically resembles the luminous Type II-L SN 1979C. Although the spectra of SN 2008es lack the narrow and intermediate-width line emission typically associated with the interaction of a SN with the circumstellar medium of its progenitor star, we argue that the extreme luminosity of SN 2008es is powered via strong interaction with a dense, optically thick circumstellar medium. The integrated bolometric luminosity of SN 2008es yields a total radiated energy at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths of >10^51 ergs. Finally, we examine the apparently anomalous rate at which the Texas Supernova Search has discovered rare kinds of supernovae, including the five most luminous supernovae observed to date, and find that their results are consistent with those of other modern SN searches. 
0808.02194	Correlated Multi-Waveband Variability in the Blazar 3C~279 from 1996 to 2007	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:R. Chatterjee, S. G. Jorstad, A. P. Marscher, H. Oh, I. M. McHardy, M. F. Aller, H. D. Aller, T. J. Balonek, H. R. Miller, W. T. Ryle, G. Tosti, O. Kurtanidze, M. Nikolashvili, V. M. Larionov, V. A. Hagen-Thorn	Abstract:  We present the results of extensive multi-waveband monitoring of the blazar 3C~279 between 1996 and 2007 at X-ray energies (2-10 keV), optical R band, and 14.5 GHz, as well as imaging with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 43 GHz. In all bands the power spectral density corresponds to "red noise" that can be fit by a single power law over the sampled time scales. Variations in flux at all three wavebands are significantly correlated. The time delay between high and low frequency bands changes substantially on time scales of years. A major multi-frequency flare in 2001 coincided with a swing of the jet toward a more southerly direction, and in general the X-ray flux is modulated by changes in the position angle of the jet near the core. The flux density in the core at 43 GHz--increases in which indicate the appearance of new superluminal knots--is significantly correlated with the X-ray flux. We decompose the X-ray and optical light curves into individual flares, finding that X-ray leads optical variations (XO) in 6 flares, the reverse occurs in 3 flares (OX), and there is essentially zero lag in 4 flares. Upon comparing theoretical expectations with the data, we conclude that (1) XO flares can be explained by gradual acceleration of radiating electrons to the highest energies; (2) OX flares can result from either light-travel delays of the seed photons (synchrotron self-Compton scattering) or gradients in maximum electron energy behind shock fronts; and (3) events with similar X-ray and optical radiative energy output originate well upstream of the 43 GHz core, while those in which the optical radiative output dominates occur at or downstream of the core. 
0808.02195	Scaling of degree correlations and the influence on diffusion in scale-free networks	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:Lazaros K. Gallos, Chaoming Song, Hernan A. Makse	Abstract:  Connectivity correlations play an important role in the structure of scale-free networks. While several empirical studies exist, there is no general theoretical analysis that can explain the largely varying behavior of real networks. Here, we use scaling theory to quantify the degree of correlations in the particular case of networks with a power-law degree distribution. These networks are classified in terms of their correlation properties, revealing additional information on their structure. For instance, the studied social networks and the Internet at the router level are clustered around the line of random networks, implying a strongly connected core of hubs. On the contrary, some biological networks and the WWW exhibit strong anti-correlations. The present approach can be used to study robustness or diffusion, where we find that anti-correlations tend to accelerate the diffusion process. 
0808.02196	Jamming II: Edwards' statistical mechanics of random packings of hard spheres	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Ping Wang, Chaoming Song, Yuliang Jin, Hernan A. Makse	Abstract:  The problem of finding the most efficient way to pack spheres has an illustrious history, dating back to the crystalline arrays conjectured by Kepler and the random geometries explored by Bernal in the 60's. This problem finds applications spanning from the mathematician's pencil, the processing of granular materials, the jamming and glass transitions, all the way to fruit packing in every grocery. There are presently numerous experiments showing that the loosest way to pack spheres gives a density of ~55% (RLP) while filling all the loose voids results in a maximum density of ~63-64% (RCP). While those values seem robustly true, to this date there is no physical explanation or theoretical prediction for them. Here we show that random packings of monodisperse hard spheres in 3d can pack between the densities 4/(4 + 2 \sqrt 3) or 53.6% and 6/(6 + 2 \sqrt 3) or 63.4%, defining RLP and RCP, respectively. The reason for these limits arises from a statistical picture of jammed states in which the RCP can be interpreted as the ground state of the ensemble of jammed matter with zero compactivity, while the RLP arises in the infinite compactivity limit. We combine an extended statistical mechanics approach 'a la Edwards' (where the role traditionally played by the energy and temperature in thermal systems is substituted by the volume and compactivity) with a constraint on mechanical stability imposed by the isostatic condition. Ultimately, our results lead to a phase diagram that provides a unifying view of the disordered hard sphere packing problem. 
0808.02197	The Katok-Spatzier Conjecture and Generalized Symmetries	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Lennard F. Bakker	Abstract:  Within the smooth category, an intertwining is exhibited between the global rigidity of irreducible higher rank abelian Anosov actions on the n-torus and the classification of equilibrium-free flows on the n-torus that possess nontrivial generalized symmetries. 
0808.02198	Distribution of volumes and coordination number in jammed matter: mesoscopic ensemble	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Ping Wang, Chaoming Song, Yuliang Jin, Kun Wang, Hernan A. Makse	Abstract:  We investigate the distribution of the volume and coordination number associated to each particle in a jammed packing of monodisperse hard sphere using the mesoscopic ensemble developed in Nature 453, 606 (2008). Theory predicts an exponential distribution of the orientational volumes for random close packings and random loose packings. A comparison with computer generated packings reveals deviations from the theoretical prediction in the volume distribution, which can be better modeled by a compressed exponential function. On the other hand, the average of the volumes is well reproduced by the theory leading to good predictions of the limiting densities of RCP and RLP. We discuss a more exact theory to capture the volume distribution in its entire range. The available data suggests a plausible order/disorder transition defining random close packings. Finally, we consider an extended ensemble to calculate the coordination number distribution which is shown to be of an exponential and inverse exponential form for coordinations larger and smaller than the average, respectively, in reasonable agreement with the simulated data. 
0808.02199	Tensor gauge field localization in branes	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:M. O. Tahim, W. T. Cruz, C. A. S. Almeida	Abstract:  In this work we study localization of a Kalb-Ramond tensorial gauge field on a membrane described by real scalar fields. The membrane is embedded in an AdS-type five dimensional bulk space, which mimic a Randall-Sundrum scenario. First, we consider a membrane described by only a single real scalar field. In that scenarios we find that there is no localized tensorial zero mode. When we take into account branes described by two real scalar fields with internal structures, we obtain again a non-localized zero mode for a Kalb-Ramond tensorial gauge field. After modifying our model of one single scalar field by coupling the dilaton to the Kalb-Ramond field, we find that this result is changed. Furthermore, we analyze Kaluza-Klein massive modes and resonance structures. 
0808.02200	Pinned Repetitions in Symbolic Flows: Preliminary Results	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Michael Boshernitzan (Rice), David Damanik (Rice)    	Abstract:  We consider symbolic flows over finite alphabets and study certain kinds of repetitions in these sequences. Positive and negative results for the existence of such repetitions are given for codings of interval exchange transformations and codings of quadratic polynomials. 
0808.02201	Pressure and interaction measure of the gluon plasma	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:D. Antonov, H.-J. Pirner, M.G. Schmidt	Abstract:  We explore the thermodynamics of the gluon plasma in SU(3) Yang-Mills theory emerging from the non-trivial spatial dynamics of valence gluons. The lattice data suggest that these gluons interact with each other linearly at large spatial separations. At high temperatures, valence gluons should reproduce the pressure of the non-interacting Stefan-Boltzmann plasma along with the leading perturbative correction. These properties of valence gluons can be modeled in terms of the integral over their trajectories. We calculate such a world-line integral analytically and obtain the pressure and the interaction measure $(\varepsilon-3p)/T^4$ of the gluon plasma. Additionally, we account for the contributions of stochastic background fields to these thermodynamic quantities. The results turn out to be in a good agreement with the corresponding lattice data. In particular, the lattice-simulated peak of the interaction measure near the deconfinement critical temperature is reproduced. 
0808.02202	Laws of Population Growth	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:Hernan D. Rozenfeld, Diego Rybski, Jose S. Andrade Jr., Michael Batty, H. Eugene Stanley, Hernan A. Makse	Abstract:  An important issue in the study of cities is defining a metropolitan area, as different definitions affect the statistical distribution of urban activity. A commonly employed method of defining a metropolitan area is the Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA), based on rules attempting to capture the notion of city as a functional economic region, and is constructed using experience. The MSA is time-consuming and is typically constructed only for a subset (few hundreds) of the most highly populated cities. Here, we introduce a new method to designate metropolitan areas, denoted the "City Clustering Algorithm" (CCA). The CCA is based on spatial distributions of the population at a fine geographic scale, defining a city beyond the scope of its administrative boundaries. We use the CCA to examine Gibrat's law of proportional growth, postulating that the mean and standard deviation of the growth rate of cities are constant, independent of city size. We find that the mean growth rate of a cluster utilizing the CCA exhibits deviations from Gibrat's law, and that the standard deviation decreases as a power-law with respect to the city size. The CCA allows for the study of the underlying process leading to these deviations, shown to arise from the existence of long-range spatial correlations in the population growth. These results have socio-political implications, such as those pertaining to the location of new economic development in cities of varied size. 
0808.02203	Energy-landscape network approach to the glass transition	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Shai Carmi, Shlomo Havlin, Chaoming Song, Kun Wang, Hernan A. Makse	Abstract:  We study the energy-landscape network of Lennard-Jones clusters as a model of a glass forming system. We find the stable basins and the first order saddles connecting them, and identify them with the network nodes and links, respectively. We analyze the network properties and model the system's evolution. Using the model, we explore the system's response to varying cooling rates, and reproduce many of the glass transition properties. We also find that the static network structure gives rise to a critical temperature where a percolation transition breaks down the space of configurations into disconnected components. Finally, we discuss the possibility of studying the system mathematically with a trap-model generalized to networks. 
0808.02204	A theory for viral capsid assembly around electrostatic cores	Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)	Authors:Michael F. Hagan	Abstract:  We develop equilibrium and kinetic theories that describe the assembly of viral capsid proteins on a charged central core, as seen in recent experiments in which brome mosaic virus (BMV) capsids assemble around nanoparticles functionalized with polyelectrolyte. We model interactions between capsid proteins and nanoparticle surfaces as the interaction of polyelectrolyte brushes with opposite charge, using the nonlinear Poisson Boltzmann equation. The models predict that there is a threshold density of functionalized charge, above which capsids efficiently assemble around nanoparticles, and that light scatter intensity increases rapidly at early times, without the lag phase characteristic of empty capsid assembly. These predictions are consistent with, and enable interpretation of, preliminary experimental data. However, the models predict a stronger dependence of nanoparticle incorporation efficiency on functionalized charge density than measured in experiments, and do not completely capture a logarithmic growth phase seen in experimental light scatter. These discrepancies may suggest the presence of metastable disordered states in the experimental system. In addition to discussing future experiments for nanoparticle-capsid systems, we discuss broader implications for understanding assembly around charged cores such as nucleic acids. 
0808.02205	Alignment Dynamics of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes in Pulsed Ultrahigh Magnetic Fields	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:J. Shaver, A. N. G. Parra-Vasquez, S. Hansel, O. Portugall, C. H. Mielke, M. von Ortenberg, R. H. Hauge, M. Pasquali, J. Kono	Abstract:  We have measured the dynamic alignment properties of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) suspensions in pulsed high magnetic fields through linear dichroism spectroscopy. Millisecond-duration pulsed high magnetic fields up to 56 T as well as microsecond-duration pulsed ultrahigh magnetic fields up to 166 T were used. Due to their anisotropic magnetic properties, SWNTs align in an applied magnetic field, and because of their anisotropic optical properties, aligned SWNTs show linear dichroism. The characteristics of their overall alignment depend on several factors, including the viscosity and temperature of the suspending solvent, the degree of anisotropy of nanotube magnetic susceptibilities, the nanotube length distribution, the degree of nanotube bundling, and the strength and duration of the applied magnetic field. In order to explain our data, we have developed a theoretical model based on the Smoluchowski equation for rigid rods that accurately reproduces the salient features of the experimental data. 
0808.02206	Fractal and Transfractal Scale-Free Networks	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:Hernan D. Rozenfeld, Lazaros K. Gallos, Chaoming Song, Hernan A. Makse	Abstract:  Self-similarity is a property of fractal structures, a concept introduced by Mandelbrot and one of the fundamental mathematical results of the 20th century. The importance of fractal geometry stems from the fact that these structures were recognized in numerous examples in Nature, from the coexistence of liquid/gas at the critical point of evaporation of water, to snowflakes, to the tortuous coastline of the Norwegian fjords, to the behavior of many complex systems such as economic data, or the complex patterns of human agglomeration. Here we review the recent advances in self-similarity of complex networks and its relation to transport, diffusion, percolations and other topological properties such us degree distribution, modularity, and degree-degree correlations. 
0808.02207	Asymptotic behavior of the mean square displacement of the Brownian parametric oscillator near the singular point	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Tohru Tashiro	Abstract:  A parametric oscillator with damping driven by white noise is studied. The mean square displacement (MSD) in the long-time limit is derived analytically for the case that the static force vanishes, which was not treated in the past work \cite{tashiro07}. The formula is asymptotic but is applicable to a general periodic function. On the basis of this formula, some periodic functions reducing MSD remarkably are proposed. 
0808.02208	Challenges to the DGP Model from Horizon-Scale Growth and Geometry	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Wenjuan Fang, Sheng Wang, Wayne Hu, Zoltan Haiman, Lam Hui, Morgan May	Abstract:  We conduct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo study of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) self-accelerating braneworld scenario given the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy, supernovae and Hubble constant data by implementing an effective dark energy prescription for modified gravity into a standard Einstein-Boltzmann code. We find no way to alleviate the tension between distance measures and horizon scale growth in this model. Growth alterations due to perturbations propagating into the bulk appear as excess CMB anisotropy at the lowest multipoles. In a flat cosmology, the maximum likelihood DGP model is nominally a 5.3 sigma poorer fit than Lambda CDM. Curvature can reduce the tension between distance measures but only at the expense of exacerbating the problem with growth leading to a 4.8 sigma result that is dominated by the low multipole CMB temperature spectrum. While changing the initial conditions to reduce large scale power can flatten the temperature spectrum, this also suppresses the large angle polarization spectrum in violation of recent results from WMAP5. The failure of this model highlights the power of combining growth and distance measures in cosmology as a test of gravity on the largest scales. 
0808.02209	How to make large, void free dust clusters in dusty plasma under microgravity	Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)	Authors:V. Land, W. J. Goedheer	Abstract:  Collections of micrometer sized solid particles immersed in plamsa are used to mimic many systems from solid state and fluid physics, due to their strong electrostatic interaction, their large inertia, and the fact that they are large enough to be visualized with ordinary optics. On Earth, gravity restricts the so called dusty plasma systems to thin, two-dimensional layers, unless special experimental geometries are used, involving heated or cooled electrons, and/or the use of dielectric materials.In micro-gravity experiments, the formation of a dust-free void breaks the isotropy of three-dimensional dusty plasma systems. In order to do real three-dimensional experiments, this void has somehow to be closed. In this paper, we use a fully self-consistent fluid model to study the closure of a void in a micro-gravity experiment, by lowering the driving potential. The analysis goes beyond the simple description of the virtual void, which describes the formation of a void without taking the dust into account. We show that self-organization plays an important role in void formation and void closure, which also allows a reversed scheme, where a discharge is run at low driving potentials and small batches of dust are added. No hysteresis is found this way. Finally, we compare our results to recent experiments and find good agreement,but only when we do not take charge-exchange collisions into account. 
0808.02210	The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. The OGLE-III Catalog of Variable Stars. I. Classical Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:I. Soszynski, R. Poleski, A. Udalski, M.K. Szymanski, M. Kubiak, G. Pietrzynski, L. Wyrzykowski, O. Szewczyk, K. Ulaczyk	Abstract:  We present the first part of a new catalog of variable stars (OIII-CVS) compiled from the data collected in the course of the third phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-III). In this paper we describe the catalog of 3361 classical Cepheids detected in the ~40 square degrees area in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The sample consists of 1848 fundamental-mode (F), 1228 first-overtone (1O), 14 second-overtone (2O), 61 double-mode F/1O, 203 double-mode 1O/2O, 2 double-mode 1O/3O, and 5 triple-mode classical Cepheids. This sample is supplemented by the list of 23 ultra-low amplitude variable stars which may be Cepheids entering or exiting instability strip. The catalog data include VI high-quality photometry collected since 2001, and for some stars supplemented by the OGLE-II photometry obtained between 1997 and 2000. We provide basic parameters of the stars: coordinates, periods, mean magnitudes, amplitudes and parameters of the Fourier light curve decompositions. Individual objects of particular interest are discussed, including single-mode second-overtone Cepheids, multiperiodic pulsators with unusual period ratios or Cepheids in eclipsing binary systems. We discuss the variations of the Fourier coefficients with periods and point out on the sharp feature for periods around 0.35 days of first-overtone Cepheids, which can be explained by the occurrence of 2:1 resonance between the first and fifth overtones. Similar behavior at P=3 days for 1O Cepheids and P=10 days for F Cepheids are also interpreted as an effect of resonances between two radial modes. We fit the period-luminosity relations to our sample of Cepheids and compare these functions with previous determinations. 
0808.02211	Sample size effects in multivariate fitting of correlated data	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:D. Toussaint, W. Freeman	Abstract:  A common problem in analysis of experiments or in lattice QCD simulations is fitting a parameterized model to the average over a number of samples of correlated data values. If the number of samples is not infinite, estimates of the variance of the parameters ("error bars") and of the goodness of fit are affected. We illustrate these problems with numerical simulations, and calculate approximate corrections to the variance of the parameters for estimates made in the standard way from derivatives of the parameters' probability distribution as well as from jackknife and bootstrap estimates. 
0808.02212	Expansion of a quantum gas released from an optical lattice	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:F. Gerbier, S. Trotzky, S. Foelling, U. Schnorrberger, J. D. Thompson, A. Widera, I. Bloch, L. Pollet, M. Troyer, B. Capogrosso-Sansone, N. V. Prokof'ev, B. V. Svistunov	Abstract:  We analyze the interference pattern produced by ultracold atoms released from an optical lattice. Such interference patterns are commonly interpreted as the momentum distributions of the trapped quantum gas. We show that for finite time-of-flights the resulting density distribution can, however, be significantly altered, similar to a near-field diffraction regime in optics. We illustrate our findings with a simple model and realistic quantum Monte Carlo simulations for bosonic atoms, and compare the latter to experiments. 
0808.02213	Multidimensional Chebyshev Systems - just a definition	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Ognyan Kounchev	Abstract:  We provide a definition of Multidimensional Chebyshev Systems of order N which is satisfied by the solutions of a wide class of elliptic equations of order 2N. This definition generalizes a very large class of Extended Complete Chebyshev systems in the one-dimensional case. This is the first of a series of papers in this area, which solves the longstanding problem of finding a satisfactory multidimensional generalization of the classical Chebyshev systems introduced already by A. Markov more than hundered years ago, and studied later by S. Bernstein and M. Krein. 
0808.02214	Relativistic Iron Line Emission from the Neutron Star Low-mass X-ray Binary 4U 1636-536	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Dirk Pandel, Philip Kaaret (Univ. of Iowa), Stephane Corbel (Univ. Paris Diderot, CEA Saclay - AIM)    	Abstract:  We present an analysis of XMM-Newton and RXTE data from three observations of the neutron star LMXB 4U 1636-536. The X-ray spectra show clear evidence of a broad, asymmetric iron emission line extending over the energy range 4-9 keV. The line profile is consistent with relativistically broadened Fe K-alpha emission from the inner accretion disk. The Fe K-alpha line in 4U 1636-536 is considerably broader than the asymmetric iron lines recently found in other neutron star LMXBs, which indicates a high disk inclination. We find evidence that the broad iron line feature is a combination of several K-alpha lines from iron in different ionization states. 
0808.02215	Proton elastic impact factors for two, three, and four gluons	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:L. Motyka	Abstract:  In this talk we report on recent calculation of high energy baryon scattering amplitudes in QCD. Elastic baryon impact factors for two, three and four gluons are presented and their energy evolution is described that incorporates unitarity corrections. We find that the baryon couples directly to the BFKL Pomeron, to the BKP odderon and to a new state, a three-gluon BKP Pomeron. The new state may decay into four gluons with a new 3 -> 4 transition vertex. This vertex defines the transition amplitude of the three-gluon BKP Pomeron state into two BFKL Pomerons. 
0808.02216	Searching for odderon in exclusive vector meson hadroproduction	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:L. Motyka	Abstract:  In this talk estimates are presented of the odderon contributions to the exclusive J/psi and Upsilon production cross-sections at the Tevatron and the Large Hadron Collider. The obtained cross-sections are compared to cross-sections of the dominant background subprocesses mediated by the photon exchange. Possible experimental cuts are proposed that reduce the photon background. 
0808.02217	Scalar $QCD_{4}$ on the null-plane	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:R. Casana, B.M. Pimentel, G. E. R. Zambrano	Abstract:  We have studied the null-plane hamiltonian structure of the free Yang-Mills fields and the scalar chromodynamics ($SQCD_{4}$). Following the Dirac's procedure for constrained systems we have performed a detailed analysis of the constraint structure of both models and we give the generalized Dirac brackets for the physical variables. In the free Yang-Mills case, using the correspondence principle in the Dirac's brackets we obtain the same commutators present in the literature. 
0808.02218	Faster strain fluctuation methods through partial volume updates	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Sander Pronk, Phillip L. Geissler	Abstract:  Elastic systems that are spatially heterogeneous in their mechanical response pose special challenges for molecular simulations. Standard methods for sampling thermal fluctuations of a system's size and shape proceed through a series of homogeneous deformations, whose magnitudes can be severely restricted by its stiffest parts. Here we present a Monte Carlo algorithm designed to circumvent this difficulty, which can be prohibitive in many systems of modern interest. By deforming randomly selected subvolumes alone, it naturally distributes the amplitude of spontaneous elastic fluctuations according to intrinsic heterogeneity. We describe in detail implementations of such "slice moves" that are consistent with detailed balance. Their practical application is illustrated for a random network of cross-linked polymers. 
0808.02219	On isoperimetric profiles of algebras	Rings and Algebras (math.RA)	Authors:Michele D'Adderio	Abstract:  Isoperimetric profile in algebras was first introduced by Gromov. We study the behavior of the isoperimetric profile under various ring theoretic constructions and its relation with the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension. 
0808.02220	Every Computably Enumerable Random Real Is Provably Computably Enumerable Random	Computational Complexity (cs.CC)	Authors:Cristian S. Calude, Nicholas J. Hay	Abstract:  We prove that every computably enumerable (c.e.) random real is provable in Peano Arithmetic (PA) to be c.e. random. A major step in the proof is to show that the theorem stating that "a real is c.e. and random iff it is the halting probability of a universal prefix-free Turing machine" can be proven in PA. Our proof, which is simpler than the standard one, can also be used for the original theorem. Our positive result can be contrasted with the case of computable functions, where not every computable function is provably computable in PA, or even more interestingly, with the fact that almost all random finite strings are not provably random in PA. We also prove two negative results: a) there exists a universal machine whose universality cannot be proved in PA, b) there exists a universal machine $U$ such that, based on $U$, PA cannot prove the randomness of its halting probability. The paper also includes a sharper form of the Kraft-Chaitin Theorem, as well as a formal proof of this theorem written with the proof assistant Isabelle. 
0808.02221	Possibility of single biomolecular imaging with coherent amplification of weak scattering X-ray photons	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Tsumoru Shintake	Abstract:  The number of photons available by coherent X-ray scattering from a single biomolecule is considerably less because of the extremely small elastic-scattering cross-section and low damage threshold. Even with a high X-ray flux of 3 x 10to 12 photons per 100-nm-diameter spot and an ultrashort pulse of 10 fs driven by a future X-ray free electron laser (X-ray FEL), it has been predicted that only a few 100 photons will be available by scattering from a single lysozyme molecule. In this paper I propose a new method: instead of directly observing the photons scattered from the sample, we amplify the scattered waves by superimposing an intense coherent reference pump wave on it and record the resulting interference pattern using a planar X-ray detector, similar to technique followed in holography. Using a nanosized gold particle as a reference pump wave source, we can collect 10 to 4 ~ 10 to 5 photons in single shot imaging where the signal from a single biomolecule is amplified and recorded as 2D diffraction intensity data. To recover the phase information and reconstruct the image, the iterative phase retrieval technique will be applicable. However, the technical difficulty is how to precisely reconstruct faint image of the single bio-molecular in Angstrom resolution, whose intensity is much lower than the bright gold particle linked to it. In order to solve this problem, I propose a new scheme that combines the iterative phase-retrieval on reference pump wave and digital Fourier transform holography. 
0808.02222	Better Bounds for Frequency Moments in Random-Order Streams	Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)	Authors:Alexandr Andoni, Andrew McGregor, Krzysztof Onak, Rina Panigrahy	Abstract:  Estimating frequency moments of data streams is a very well studied problem and tight bounds are known on the amount of space that is necessary and sufficient when the stream is adversarially ordered. Recently, motivated by various practical considerations and applications in learning and statistics, there has been growing interest into studying streams that are randomly ordered. In the paper we improve the previous lower bounds on the space required to estimate the frequency moments of a randomly ordered streams. 
0808.02223	Breaking GUT Groups in F-Theory	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Ron Donagi, Martijn Wijnholt	Abstract:  We consider the possibility of breaking the GUT group to the Standard Model gauge group in F-theory compactifications by turning on certain U(1) fluxes. We show that the requirement of massless hypercharge is equivalent to a topological constraint on the UV completion of the local model. The possibility of this mechanism is intrinsic to F-theory. We address some of the phenomenological signatures of this scenario. We show that our models predict monopoles as in conventional GUT models. We discuss in detail the leading threshold corrections to the gauge kinetic terms and their effect on unification. They turn out to be related to Ray-Singer torsion. We also discuss the issue of proton decay in F-theory models and explain how to engineer models which satisfy current experimental bounds. 
0808.02224	Magnetic impurities on the surface of a topological insulator	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Qin Liu, Chao-Xing Liu, Cenke Xu, Xiao-Liang Qi, Shou-Cheng Zhang	Abstract:  The surface states of a topological insulator are described by an emergent relativistic massless Dirac equation in 2+1 dimensions. In contrast to graphene, there is an odd number of Dirac points, and the electron spin is directly coupled to the momentum. We show that a magnetic impurity opens up a local gap and suppresses the local density of states. Furthermore, the Dirac electronic states mediate an RKKY interaction among the magnetic impurities which is always ferromagnetic, whenever the chemical potential lies near the Dirac point. These effects can be directly measured in STM experiments. We also study the case of quenched disorder through a renormalization group analysis. 
0808.02225	A Bayesian method to set upper limits on the strength of a periodic gravitational wave signal from the remnant of SN1987A: possible applications in LIGO searches	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Richard Umstaetter, Renate Meyer, Nelson Christensen	Abstract:  We present a method that assesses the theoretical detection limit of a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo search for a periodic gravitational wave signal emitted by a neutron star. Inverse probability yields an upper limit estimate for the strength when a signal could not be detected in an observed data set. The proposed method is based on Bayesian model comparison that automatically quantifies Occam s Razor. It limits the complexity of a model by favoring the most parsimonious model that explains the data. By comparing the model with a signal from a pulsar to the null model that assumes solely noise, we derive the detection probability and an estimate for the upper limit that a search, for example, for a narrow-band emission for SN1987a, might yield on data at the sensitivity of LIGO data for an observation time of one year. 
0808.02226	Qubit phase-space: SU(n) coherent state P-representations	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:D. W. Barry, P. D. Drummond	Abstract:  We introduce a phase-space representation for qubits and spin models. The technique uses an SU(n) coherent state basis, and can equally be used for either static or dynamical simulations. We review previously known definitions and operator identities, and show how these can be used to define an off-diagonal, positive phase-space representation analogous to the positive P-function. As an illustration of the phase-space method, we use the example of the Ising model, which has exact solutions for the finite temperature canonical ensemble in two dimensions. We show how a canonical ensemble for an Ising model of arbitrary structure can be efficiently simulated using SU(2) or atomic coherent states. The technique utilizes a transformation from a canonical (imaginary-time) weighted simulation to an equivalent unweighted real-time simulation. The results are compared to the exactly soluble two-dimensional case. We note that Ising models in one, two or three dimensions are potentially achievable experimentally as a lattice-gas of ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices. The technique is not restricted to canonical ensembles or to Ising-like couplings. It is also able to be used for real-time evolution, and for systems whose time-evolution follows a master-equation describing decoherence and coupling to external reservoirs. The case of SU(n) phase-space is used to describe n-level systems. In general, the requirement that time-evolution is stochastic corresponds to a restriction to Hamiltonians and master-equations that are quadratic in the group generators or generalized spin operators. 
0808.02227	Higher Order Moments Generation by Mellin Transform for Compound Models of Clutter	Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)	Authors:C Bhattacharya	Abstract:  The compound models of clutter statistics are found suitable to describe the nonstationary nature of radar backscattering from high-resolution observations. In this letter, we show that the properties of Mellin transform can be utilized to generate higher order moments of simple and compound models of clutter statistics in a compact manner. 
0808.02228	Relatively Open Gromov-Witten Invariants for Symplectic Manifolds of Lower Dimensions	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Hai-Long Her	Abstract:  Let $(X,ω)$ be a compact symplectic manifold, $L$ be a Lagrangian submanifold and $V$ be a codimension 2 symplectic submanifold of $X$, we consider the pseudoholomorphic maps from a Riemann surface with boundary $(Σ,\partialΣ)$ to the pair $(X,L)$ satisfying Lagrangian boundary conditions and intersecting $V$. In some special cases, for instance, under the semi-positivity condition, we study the stable moduli space of such open pseudoholomorphic maps involving the intersection data. If $L\cap V=\emptyset$, we study the problem of orientability of the moduli space. Moreover, assume that there exists an anti-symplectic involution $φ$ on $X$ such that $L$ is the fixed point set of $φ$ and $V$ is $φ$-anti-invariant, then we define the so-called "relatively open" invariants for the tuple $(X,ω,V,φ)$ if $L$ is orientable and dim$X\le 6$. If $L$ is nonorientable, we define such invariants under the condition that dim$X\le4$ and some additional restrictions on the number of marked points on each boundary component of the domain. 
0808.02229	Plaquette Order in the J1-J2-J3 model: a series expansion analysis	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Marcelo Arlego, Wolfram Brenig	Abstract:  Series expansion based on the flow equation method is employed to study the zero temperature properties of the spin-1/2 J1-J2-J3 antiferromagnet in two dimensions. Starting from the exact limit of decoupled plaquettes in a particular generalized J1-J2-J3 model we analyze the evolution of the ground state energy and the elementary triplet excitations in powers of all three inter-plaquette couplings up to fifth order. We find the plaquette phase to remain stable over a wide range of exchange couplings and to connect adiabatically up to the case of the plain J1-J2-J3 model, however not to the J1-J2 model at J3=0. Besides confirming the existence of such a phase, recently predicted by Mambrini, et al. [Phys. Rev. B 74, 144422 [2006)], we estimate its extent by Dlog-Pade analysis of the critical lines that result from closure of the triplet gap. 
0808.02230	The distribution of the irreducibles in an algebraic number field	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:David M. Bradley, Ali E. Özlük, Rebecca A. Rozario, C. Snyder	Abstract:  We study the distribution of principal ideals generated by irreducible elements in an algebraic number field. 
0808.02231	The limited role of non-native contacts in folding pathways of a lattice protein	Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)	Authors:Brian C. Gin, Juan P. Garrahan, Phillip L. Geissler	Abstract:  Models of protein energetics which neglect interactions between amino acids that are not adjacent in the native state, such as the Go model, encode or underlie many influential ideas on protein folding. Implicit in this simplification is a crucial assumption that has never been critically evaluated in a broad context: Detailed mechanisms of protein folding are not biased by non-native contacts, typically imagined as a consequence of sequence design and/or topology. Here we present, using computer simulations of a well-studied lattice heteropolymer model, the first systematic test of this oft-assumed correspondence over the statistically significant range of hundreds of thousands of amino acid sequences, and a concomitantly diverse set of folding pathways. Enabled by a novel means of fingerprinting folding trajectories, our study reveals a profound insensitivity of the order in which native contacts accumulate to the omission of non-native interactions. Contrary to conventional thinking, this robustness does not arise from topological restrictions and does not depend on folding rate. We find instead that the crucial factor in discriminating among topological pathways is the heterogeneity of native contact energies. Our results challenge conventional thinking on the relationship between sequence design and free energy landscapes for protein folding, and help justify the widespread use of Go-like models to scrutinize detailed folding mechanisms of real proteins. 
0808.02232	Digital PCR provides sensitive and absolute calibration for high throughput sequencing	Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)	Authors:Richard A. White III, Paul Blainey, H. Christina Fan, Stephen R. Quake	Abstract:  Several of the next generation sequencers are limited in their sample preparation process by the need to make an absolute measurement of the number of template molecules in the library to be sequenced. As currently practiced, the practical effects of this requirement compromise sequencing performance, both by requiring large amounts of sample DNA and by requiring extra sequencing runs to be performed. We used digital PCR to quantitate sequencing libraries, and demonstrated its sensitivity and robustness by preparing and sequencing libraries from subnanogram amounts of bacterial and human DNA on the 454 and Solexa sequencing platforms. This assay allows absolute quantitation and eliminates uncertainties associated with the construction and application of standard curves. The digital PCR platform consumes subfemptogram amounts of the sequencing library and gives highly accurate results, allowing the optimal DNA concentration to be used in setting up sequencing runs without costly and time-consuming titration techniques. This approach also reduces the input sample requirement more than 1000-fold: from micrograms of DNA to less than a nanogram. 
0808.02233	On the Importance of the Interclump Medium for Superionization: O VI Formation in the Wind of Zeta Pup	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. Zsargo, D. J. Hillier, J.-C. Bouret, T. Lanz, M. A. Leutenegger, D. Cohen	Abstract:  We have studied superionization and X-ray line formation in the spectra of Zeta Pup using our new stellar atmosphere code (XCMFGEN) that can be used to simultaneously analyze optical, UV, and X-ray observations. Here, we present results on the formation of the O VI ll1032, 1038 doublet. Our simulations, supported by simple theoretical calculations, show that clumped wind models that assume void in the interclump space cannot reproduce the observed O VI profiles. However, enough O VI can be produced if the voids are filled by a low density gas. The recombination of O VI is very efficient in the dense material but in the tenuous interclump region an observable amount of O VI can be maintained. We also find that different UV resonance lines are sensitive to different density regimes in Zeta Pup : C IV is almost exclusively formed within the densest regions, while the majority of O VI resides between clumps. N V is an intermediate case, with contributions from both the tenuous gas and clumps. 
0808.02234	Sum of squares of degrees in a graph	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Bernardo M. Ábrego, Silvia Fernández-Merchant, Michael G. Neubauer, William Watkins	Abstract:  Let $\G(v,e)$ be the set of all simple graphs with $v$ vertices and $e$ edges and let $P_2(G)=\sum d_i^2$ denote the sum of the squares of the degrees, $d_1, >..., d_v$, of the vertices of $G$. It is known that the maximum value of $P_2(G)$ for $G \in \G(v,e)$ occurs at one or both of two special graphs in $\G(v,e)$--the \qs graph or the \qc graph. For each pair $(v,e)$, we determine which of these two graphs has the larger value of $P_2(G)$. We also determine all pairs $(v,e)$ for which the values of $P_2(G)$ are the same for the \qs and the \qc graph. In addition to the \qs and \qc graphs, we find all other graphs in $\G(v,e)$ for which the maximum value of $P_2(G)$ is attained. Density questions posed by previous authors are examined. 
0808.02235	Normal diffusion in crystal structures and higher-dimensional billiard models with gaps	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:David P. Sanders (Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Nacional Aut\'onoma de M\'exico)    	Abstract:  We show, both heuristically and numerically, that three-dimensional periodic Lorentz gases -- clouds of particles scattering off crystalline arrays of hard spheres -- often exhibit normal diffusion, even when there are gaps through which particles can travel without ever colliding, i.e., when the system has an infinite horizon. This is the case provided that these gaps are not "too big", as measured by their dimension. The results are illustrated with simulations of a simple three-dimensional model having different types of diffusive regime, and are then extended to higher-dimensional billiard models, which include hard-sphere fluids. 
0808.02236	Cosmology for Particle Physicists	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:U. A. Yajnik	Abstract:  In these notes we present a selection of topics, each section approximately amounting to one lecture. We begin with a brief recapitulation of General Relativity, and the Standard Model of Cosmology. This is followed by lectures on important signatures of the remote past. These include : (i) inflation, (ii) density perturbations leading to galaxy formation, (iii) study of hot and cold relics decoupled from the remaining constituents, some of which can be candidates for Dark Matter, (iv) baryon asymmetry of the Universe. 
0808.02237	The incommensurate magnetic structure of YMn2O5: a stringent test of the multiferroic mechanism	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:P.G. Radaelli, C. Vecchini, L.C. Chapon, P.J. Brown, S. Park, S-W. Cheong	Abstract:  We have determined the magnetic structure of the low-temperature incommensurate phase of multiferroic YMn2O5 using single-crystal neutron diffraction. By employing corepresentation analysis, we have ensured full compliance with both symmetry and physical constraints, so that the electrical polarization must lie along the b axis, as observed. The evolution of the spin components and propagation through the commensurate-incommensurate phase boundary points unambiguously at the exchange-striction mechanism as the primary driving force for ferroelectricity. 
0808.02238	Drell-Yan Cross Section in the Jet Calculus Scheme	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Hidekazu Tanaka, Hirokazu Kobayashi	Abstract:  We calculate factorized cross sections for lepton pair production mediated by a virtual photon in hadron-hadron collisions using the jet calculus scheme, in which a kinematical constraint due to parton radiation is taken into account. This method guarantees a proper phase space boundary for subtraction terms. Some properties of the calculated cross sections are examined. We also discuss matching between the hard scattering cross sections and parton showers at the next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) order of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). 
0808.02239	Implicit-Explicit Variational Integration of Highly Oscillatory Problems	Numerical Analysis (math.NA)	Authors:Ari Stern, Eitan Grinspun	Abstract:  In this paper, we derive a variational integrator for certain highly oscillatory problems in mechanics. To do this, we take a new approach to the splitting of fast and slow potential forces: rather than splitting these forces at the level of the differential equations or the Hamiltonian, we split the two potentials with respect to the Lagrangian action integral. By using a different quadrature rule to approximate the contribution of each potential to the action, we arrive at a geometric integrator that is implicit in the fast force and explicit in the slow force. This can allow for significantly longer time steps to be taken (compared to standard explicit methods, such as Störmer/Verlet) at the cost of only a linear solve rather than a full nonlinear solve. We also analyze the stability of this method, in particular proving that it eliminates the linear resonance instabilities that can arise with explicit multiple-time-stepping methods. Next, we perform some numerical experiments, studying the behavior of this integrator for two test problems: a system of coupled linear oscillators, for which we compare against the resonance behavior of the r-RESPA method; and slow energy exchange in the Fermi--Pasta--Ulam problem, which couples fast linear oscillators with slow nonlinear oscillators. Finally, we prove that this integrator accurately preserves the slow energy exchange between the fast oscillatory components, which explains the numerical behavior observed for the Fermi--Pasta--Ulam problem. 
0808.02240	Reconstructing the Cosmic Expansion History up to Redshift z=6.29 with the Calibrated Gamma-Ray Bursts	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Hao Wei, Shuang Nan Zhang	Abstract:  Recently, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) were proposed to be a complementary cosmological probe to type Ia supernovae (SNIa). GRBs have been advocated to be standard candles since several empirical GRB luminosity relations were proposed as distance indicators. However, there is a so-called circularity problem in the direct use of GRBs. Recently, a new idea to calibrate GRBs in a completely cosmology independent manner has been proposed, and the circularity problem can be solved. In the present work, following the method proposed by Liang {\it et al.}, we calibrate 70 GRBs with the Amati relation using 307 SNIa. Then, following the method proposed by Shafieloo {\it et al.}, we smoothly reconstruct the cosmic expansion history up to redshift $z=6.29$ with the calibrated GRBs. We find some new features in the reconstructed results. 
0808.02241	Persistent Clustering and a Theorem of J. Kleinberg	Machine Learning (stat.ML)	Authors:Gunnar Carlsson, Facundo Memoli	Abstract:  We construct a framework for studying clustering algorithms, which includes two key ideas: persistence and functoriality. The first encodes the idea that the output of a clustering scheme should carry a multiresolution structure, the second the idea that one should be able to compare the results of clustering algorithms as one varies the data set, for example by adding points or by applying functions to it. We show that within this framework, one can prove a theorem analogous to one of J. Kleinberg, in which one obtains an existence and uniqueness theorem instead of a non-existence result. We explore further properties of this unique scheme, stability and convergence are established. 
0808.02242	An Exploration of a Discrete Rhombohedral Lattice; of Possible Engineering or Physical Relevance (Revised Version)	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:Jim McGovern	Abstract:  A particular discrete rhombohedral lattice consisting of four symmetrically interlaced cuboctahedral point lattices is described that is interesting because of the high degree of symmetry it exhibits. The four constituent cuboctahedral lattices are denoted by four colours and the composite lattice is referred to as a 4-colour rhombohedral lattice. Each point of the 4-colour lattice can be referenced by an integer 4-tuple containing only the positive non-zero integers (the counting numbers). The relationship between the discrete rhombohedral lattice and a discrete Cartesian lattice is explained. Some interesting aspects of the lattice and of the counting-number 4-tuple coordinate system are pointed out. 
0808.02243	A note on the Chevalley-Eilenberg Cohomology for the Galilei and Poincare Algebras	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Sotirios Bonanos, Joaquim Gomis	Abstract:  We construct in a systematic way the complete Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology at form degree two, three and four for the Galilei and Poincare groups. The corresponding non-trivial forms belong to certain representations of the spatial rotation (Lorentz) group. In the case of two forms they give all possible central and non-central extensions of the Galilei group (and all non-central extensions of the Poincare group). The procedure developed in this paper can be applied to any space-time symmetry group. 
0808.02244	Connection between non-Abelian tensor gauge fields and open strings	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:George Savvidy	Abstract:  We compare the structure of the tree level scattering amplitudes in non-Abelian tensor gauge field theory and in open string theory with Chan-Paton charges. We limit ourselves considering only lower rank tensor fields in both theories. We identify the symmetric and antisymmetric components of the second rank tensor gauge field with the string excitations on the third and forth levels. In the process of this identification we have been selecting only those parts of the tree level scattering amplitudes in the open string theory which have dimensionless coupling constants in four dimensions. It seems that this subclass of tree level scattering amplitudes may provide important information about the structure of the open string theory and most probably it is equivalent to the non-Abelian tensor gauge field theory. 
0808.02245	All Oxide Ferromagnet/Semiconductor Epitaxial Heterostructures	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:A. Nielsen, A. Brandlmaier, M. Althammer, W. Kaiser, M. Opel, J. Simon, W. Mader, S.T.B. Goennenwein, R. Gross	Abstract:  Oxide based ferromagnet/semiconductor heterostructures offer substantial advantages for spin electronics. We have grown (111) oriented Fe3O4 thin films and Fe3O4/ZnO heterostructures on ZnO(0001) and Al2O3(0001) substrates by pulsed laser deposition. High quality crystalline films with mosaic spread as small as 0.03 degree, sharp interfaces, and rms surface roughness of 0.3 nm were achieved. Magnetization measurements show clear ferromagnetic behavior of the magnetite layers with a saturation magnetization of 3.2 muB/f.u. at 300 K. Our results demonstrate that the Fe3O4/ZnO system is an intriguing and promising candidate for the realization of multi-functional heterostructures. 
0808.02246	Comparing human and automatic thesaurus mapping approaches in the agricultural domain	Digital Libraries (cs.DL)	Authors:Boris Lauser, Gudrun Johannsen, Caterina Caracciolo, Johannes Keizer, Willem Robert van Hage, Philipp Mayr	Abstract:  Knowledge organization systems (KOS), like thesauri and other controlled vocabularies, are used to provide subject access to information systems across the web. Due to the heterogeneity of these systems, mapping between vocabularies becomes crucial for retrieving relevant information. However, mapping thesauri is a laborious task, and thus big efforts are being made to automate the mapping process. This paper examines two mapping approaches involving the agricultural thesaurus AGROVOC, one machine-created and one human created. We are addressing the basic question "What are the pros and cons of human and automatic mapping and how can they complement each other?" By pointing out the difficulties in specific cases or groups of cases and grouping the sample into simple and difficult types of mappings, we show the limitations of current automatic methods and come up with some basic recommendations on what approach to use when. 
0808.02247	Magnetic phase diagram in Eu$_{1-x}$La$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:T. Wu, G. Wu, H. Chen, Y. L. Xie, R. H. Liu, X. F. Wang, X. H. Chen	Abstract:  We have systematically measured resistivity, susceptibility and specific heat under different magnetic fields (H) in Eu$_{1-x}$La$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals. It is found that a metamagnetic transition from A-type antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism occurs at a critical field for magnetic sublattice of $Eu^{2+}$. The jump of specific heat is suppressed and shifts to low temperature with increasing H up to the critical value, then shifts to high temperature with further increasing H. Such behavior supports the metamagnetic transition. Detailed H-T phase diagrams for x=0 and 0.15 crystals are given, and possible magnetic structure is proposed. Magnetoresistance measurements indicate that there exists a strong coupling between local moment of $Eu^{2+}$ and charge in Fe-As layer. These results are very significant to understand the underlying physics of FeAs superconductors. 
0808.02248	Rotation-Resolved Spectroscopy of a Very Young Asteroid, (1270) Datura	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Naruhisa Takato (Subaru telescope)    	Abstract:  (1270) Datura is the largest member of a very young asteroid cluster that was thought to be broken-up 0.45 Myr ago. The light-curve and the rotation-resolved reflectance spectra (0.6 um - 1.0 um) were observed in order to find "fresh" surface. Our data show no significant spectral variation along the rotation phase. The depth of the 0.95 um absorption band, which indicates the degree of space weathering, was similar to that of an old S-type asteroid. This suggests that the reflectance spectrum in this wavelength range changes rapidly and saturates the depth of the 0.95 um absorption in less than 0.45 Myr in the main belt environment. 
0808.02249	Effect of inter-edge Coulomb interactions on transport through a point contact in a ν= 5/2 quantum Hall state	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Sourin Das, Sumathi Rao, Diptiman Sen	Abstract:  We study transport across a point contact separating two line junctions in a ν= 5/2 quantum Hall system. We analyze the effect of inter-edge Coulomb interactions between the chiral bosonic edge modes of the half-filled Landau level (assuming a Pfaffian wave function for the half-filled state) and of the two fully filled Landau levels. In the presence of inter-edge Coulomb interactions between all the six edges participating in the line junction, the stable fixed point corresponds to a point contact which is neither fully opaque nor fully transparent. Remarkably, this fixed point represents a situation where the half-filled level is fully transmitting, while the two filled levels are completely backscattered; hence the fixed point Hall conductance is given by G_H = {1/2} e^2/h. We predict the non-universal temperature power laws by which the system approaches the stable fixed point from the two unstable fixed points corresponding to the fully connected case (G_H = {5/2} e^2/h) and the fully disconnected case (G_H = 0). 
0808.02250	Turbulence-driven Polar Winds from T Tauri Stars Energized by Magnetospheric Accretion	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Steven R. Cranmer (Harvard-Smithsonian CfA)    	Abstract:  Pre-main-sequence stars are observed to be surrounded by both accretion flows and some kind of wind or jet-like outflow. Recent work by Matt and Pudritz has suggested that if classical T Tauri stars exhibit stellar winds with mass loss rates about 0.1 times their accretion rates, the wind can carry away enough angular momentum to keep the stars from being spun up unrealistically by accretion. This paper presents a preliminary set of theoretical models of accretion-driven winds from the polar regions of T Tauri stars. These models are based on recently published self-consistent simulations of the Sun's coronal heating and wind acceleration. In addition to the convection-driven MHD turbulence (which dominates in the solar case), we add another source of wave energy at the photosphere that is driven by the impact of plasma in neighboring flux tubes undergoing magnetospheric accretion. This added energy, determined quantitatively from the far-field theory of MHD wave generation, is sufficient to produce T Tauri-like mass loss rates of at least 0.01 times the accretion rate. While still about an order of magnitude below the level required for efficient angular momentum removal, these are the first self-consistent models of T Tauri winds that agree reasonably well with a range of observational mass loss constraints. The youngest modeled stellar winds are supported by Alfven wave pressure, they have low temperatures ("extended chromospheres"), and they are likely to be unstable to the formation of counterpropagating shocks and clumps far from the star. 
0808.02251	Compact symmetric spaces, triangular factorization, and Cayley coordinates	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Derek Habermas	Abstract:  Let U/K represent a connected, compact symmetric space, where theta is an involution of U that fixes K, phi: U/K to U is the geodesic Cartan embedding, and G is the complexification of U. We investigate the intersection of phi(U/K) with the Bruhat decomposition of G corresponding to a theta-stable triangular, or LDU, factorization of the Lie algebra of G. When g in phi(U/K) is generic, the corresponding factorization g=ld(g)u is unique, where l in N^-, d(g) in H, and u in N^+. In this paper we present an explicit formula for d in Cayley coordinates, compute it in several types of symmetric spaces, and use it to identify representatives of the connected components of the generic part of phi(U/K). This formula calculates a moment map for a torus action on the highest dimensional symplectic leaves of the Evens-Lu Poisson structure on U/K. 
0808.02252	Deterministic Diffusion in Periodic Billiard Models	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:David P. Sanders (Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Nacional Aut\'onoma de M\'exico)    	Abstract:  We investigate statistical properties of several classes of periodic billiard models which are diffusive. An introductory chapter gives motivation, and then a review of statistical properties of dynamical systems is given in chapter 2. In chapter 3, we study the geometry dependence of diffusion coefficients in a two-parameter 2D periodic Lorentz gas model, including a discussion of how to estimate them from data. In chapter 4, we study the shape of position and displacement distributions, which occur in the central limit theorem. We show that there is an oscillatory fine structure and what its origin is. This allows us to conjecture a refinement of the central limit theorem in these systems. A non-Maxwellian velocity distribution is shown to lead to a non-Gaussian limit distribution. Chapter 5 treats polygonal billiard channels, developing a picture of when normal and anomalous diffusion occur, the latter being due to parallel scatterers in the billiard causing a channelling effect. We also characterize the crossover from normal to anomalous diffusion. In chapter 6, we extend our methods to a 3D periodic Lorentz gas model, showing that normal diffusion occurs under certain conditions. In particular, we construct an explicit finite-horizon model, and we discuss the effect that holes in configuration space have on the diffusive properties of the system. We finish with conclusions and directions for future research. 
0808.02253	Simulation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes with CORSIKA and sim_telarray	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Konrad Bernlohr	Abstract:  Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) have resulted in a breakthrough in very-high energy (VHE) gamma-ray astrophysics. While early IACT installations faced the problem of detecting any sources at all, current instruments are able to see many sources, often over more than two orders of magnitude in energy. As instruments and analysis methods have matured, the requirements for calibration and modelling of physical and instrumental effects have increased. In this article, a set of Monte Carlo simulation tools is described that attempts to include all relevant effects for IACTs in great detail but aims to achieve this in an efficient and flexible way. These tools were originally developed for the HEGRA IACT system and later adapted for the H.E.S.S. experiment. Their inherent flexibility to describe quite arbitrary IACT systems makes them also an ideal tool for evaluating the potential of future installations. It is in use for design studies of CTA and other projects. 
0808.02254	Ultra-large Rydberg dimers in optical lattices	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:B. Vaucher, S. J. Thwaite, D. Jaksch	Abstract:  We investigate the dynamics of Rydberg electrons excited from the ground state of ultracold atoms trapped in an optical lattice. We first consider a lattice comprising an array of double-well potentials, where each double well is occupied by two ultracold atoms. We demonstrate the existence of molecular states with equilibrium distances of the order of experimentally attainable inter-well spacings and binding energies of the order of 10^3 GHz. We also consider the situation whereby ground-state atoms trapped in an optical lattice are collectively excited to Rydberg levels, such that the charge-density distributions of neighbouring atoms overlap. We compute the hopping rate and interaction matrix elements between highly-excited electrons separated by distances comparable to typical lattice spacings. Such systems have tunable interaction parameters and a temperature ~10^{-4} times smaller than the Fermi temperature, making them potentially attractive for the study and simulation of strongly correlated electronic systems. 
0808.02255	Explicit multidimensional Ingham--Beurling type estimates	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Vilmos Komornik	Abstract:  Recently a new proof was given for Beurling's Ingham type theorem on one-dimensional nonharmonic Fourier series, providing explicit constants. We improve this result by applying a short elementary method instead of the previous complex analytical approach. Our proof equally works in the multidimensional case. 
0808.02256	Cayley automaton semigroups	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Victor Maltcev	Abstract:  In this paper we characterize when a Cayley automaton semigroup is a group, is trivial, is finite, is free, is a left zero semigroup, or is a right zero semigroup. 
0808.02257	Insights into the pi- p -> eta n reaction mechanism	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:J. Durand, B. Julia-Diaz, T.-S. H. Lee, B. Saghai, T. Sato	Abstract:  A dynamical coupled-channels formalism is used to investigate the $η-$meson production mechanism on the proton induced by pions, in the total center-of-mass energy region from threshold up to 2 GeV. We show how and why studying exclusively total cross section data might turn out to be misleading in pinning down the reaction mechanism. 
0808.02258	Markovian evolution of Gaussian states in the semiclassical limit	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:O. Brodier, A. M. Ozorio de Almeida	Abstract:  We derive an approximate Gaussian solution of the Lindblad equation in the semiclassical limit, given a general Hamiltonian and linear coupling with the environment. The theory is carried out in the chord representation and describes the evolved quantum characteristic function, which gives direct access to the Wigner function and the position representation of the density operator by Fourier transforms. The propagation is based on a system of non-linear equations taking place in a double phase space, which coincides with Heller's theory of unitary evolution of Gaussian wave packets when the Lindbladian part is zero. 
0808.02259	Time delay of light signals in an energy-dependent spacetime metric	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:A. F. Grillo, E. Luzio, F. Mendez	Abstract:  In this note we review the problem of time delay of photons propagating in a spacetime with a metric that explicitly depends on the energy of the particles (Gravity-Rainbow approach). We show that corrections due to this approach -- which is closely related to DSR proposal -- produce for small redshifts ($z<<1$) smaller time delays than in the generic Lorentz Invariance Violating case. 
0808.02260	Squeezing the limit: Quantum benchmarks for the teleportation and storage of squeezed states	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:M. Owari, M. B. Plenio, E. S. Polzik, A. Serafini, M. M. Wolf	Abstract:  We derive fidelity benchmarks for the quantum storage and teleportation of squeezed states of continuous variable systems, for input ensembles where the degree of squeezing $s$ is fixed, no information about its orientation in phase space is given, and the distribution of phase space displacements is a Gaussian. In the limit where the latter becomes flat, we prove analytically that the maximal classical achievable fidelity (which is 1/2 without squeezing, for $s=1$) is given by $\sqrt{s}/(1+s)$, vanishing when the degree of squeezing diverges. For mixed states, as well as for general distributions of displacements, we reduce the determination of the benchmarks to the solution of a finite-dimensional semidefinite program, which yields accurate, certifiable bounds thanks to a rigorous analysis of the truncation error. This approach may be easily adapted to more general ensembles of input states. 
0808.02261	State Transfer in Highly Connected Networks and a Quantum Babinet Principle	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:D.I. Tsomokos, M.B. Plenio, I. de Vega, S.F. Huelga	Abstract:  The transfer of a quantum state between distant nodes in two-dimensional networks, is considered. The fidelity of state transfer is calculated as a function of the number of interactions in networks that are described by regular graphs. It is shown that perfect state transfer is achieved in a network of size N, whose structure is that of a N/2-cross polytope graph, if N is a multiple of 4. The result is reminiscent of the Babinet principle of classical optics. A quantum Babinet principle is derived, which allows for the identification of complementary graphs leading to the same fidelity of state transfer, in analogy with complementary screens providing identical diffraction patterns. 
0808.02262	Modeling electrostatic and quantum detection of molecules	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:S. Vasudevan, K. Walczak, N. Kapur, M. Neurock, A.W. Ghosh	Abstract:  We describe two different modes for electronically detecting an adsorbed molecule using a nanoscale transistor. The attachment of an ionic molecular target shifts the threshold voltage through modulation of the depletion layer electrostatics. A stronger bonding between the molecule and the channel, involving actual overlap of their quantum mechanical wavefunctions, leads to scattering by the molecular traps that creates characteristic fingerprints when scanned with a backgate. We describe a theoretical approach to model these transport characteristics. 
0808.02263	Introduction to the BRS Cohomology of the Massless Wess Zumino Model: Cybersusy II	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:John Dixon	Abstract:  This paper is the second paper in a series of four papers that introduce cybersusy, which is a new method for analyzing supersymmetry breaking in the standard supersymmetric model (SSM). The first paper was a summary of the results and the three next papers set out the details. In this second paper, we derive the full BRS operator and action for the general massless Wess-Zumino chiral supersymmetry action. This includes the source terms which bring in the equations of motion. The auxiliary field is integrated, which removes manifest supersymmetry, but which allows the Legendre transform to operate correctly to define one-particle-irreducible vertices from the connected Green's functions. Then some special terms in the BRS cohomology are described, together with the constraint equations that they must satisfy. These `simple dotspinors' are generated by a `fundamental dotspinor', which is constructed partly from the Zinn sources. The equations of motion play a very important role in the cohomology for this theory. These dotspinors play an interesting role in the BRS cohomology of the standard model, which is the subject of the third paper in the series. 
0808.02264	Traveling wave solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations	Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)	Authors:Dionisio Bazeia, Ashok Das, Laercio Losano, Mauro Jose dos Santos	Abstract:  We propose a simple algebraic method for generating classes of traveling wave solutions for a variety of partial differential equations of current interest in nonlinear science. This procedure applies equally well to equations which may or may not be integrable. We illustrate the method with two distinct classes of models, one with solutions including compactons in a class of models inspired by the Rosenau-Hyman, Rosenau-Pikovsky and Rosenau-Hyman-Staley equations, and the other with solutions including peakons in a system which generalizes the Camassa-Holm, Degasperis-Procesi and Dullin-Gotwald-Holm equations. In both cases, we obtain new classes of solutions not studied before. 
0808.02265	Uniform bounds for point cohomology of $\ell^1({\mathbb Z}_+)$ and related algebras	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Yemon Choi	Abstract:  It is well-known that the point cohomology of the convolution algebra $\ell^1({\mathbb Z}_+)$ vanishes in degrees 2 and above. We sharpen this result by obtaining splitting maps whose norms are bounded independently of the choice of point module. Our construction is a by-product of new estimates on projectivity constants of maximal ideals in $\ell^1({\mathbb Z}_+)$. Analogous results are obtained for some other $L^1$-algebras which arise from `rank one' subsemigroups of ${\mathbb R}_+$. 
0808.02266	Superefficiency from the Vantage Point of Computability	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Vladimir Vovk	Abstract:  In 1952 Lucien Le Cam announced his celebrated result that, for regular univariate statistical models, sets of points of superefficiency have Lebesgue measure zero. After reviewing the turbulent history of early studies of superefficiency, I suggest using the notion of computability as a tool for exploring the phenomenon of superefficiency. It turns out that only computable parameter points can be points of superefficiency for computable estimators. This algorithmic version of Le Cam's result implies, in particular, that sets of points of superefficiency not only have Lebesgue measure zero but are even countable. 
0808.02267	Deducing the multidimensional Szemeredi Theorem from an infinitary removal lemma	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Tim Austin (UCLA)    	Abstract:  We offer a new proof of the Furstenberg-Katznelson multiple recurrence theorem for several commuting probability-preserving transformations T_1, T_2, >..., T_d: \bbZ\curvearrowright (X,§,μ), and so, via the Furstenberg correspondence principle introduced in, a new proof of the multi-dimensional Szemeredi Theorem. We bypass the careful manipulation of certain towers of factors of a probability-preserving system that underlies the Furstenberg-Katznelson analysis, instead modifying an approach recently developed for the study of convergence of nonconventional ergodic averages to pass to a large extension of our original system in which this analysis greatly simplifies. The proof is then completed using an adaptation of arguments developed by Tao for his study of an infinitary analog of the hypergraph removal lemma. In a sense, this addresses the difficulty, highlighted by Tao, of establishing a direct connection between his infinitary, probabilistic approach to the hypergraph removal lemma and the infinitary, ergodic-theoretic approach to Szemeredi's Theorem set in motion by Furstenberg. 
0808.02268	On the geometry of a class of invariant measures and a problem of Aldous	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Tim Austin (UCLA)    	Abstract:  In his 1985 survey of notions of exchangeability, Aldous introduced a form of exchangeability corresponding to the symmetries of the infinite discrete cube, and asked whether these exchangeable probability measures enjoy a representation theorem similar to those for exchangeable sequences, arrays and set-indexed families. In this note we to prove that, whereas the known representation theorems for different classes of partially exchangeable probability measure imply that the compact convex set of such measures is a Bauer simplex (that is, its subset of extreme points is closed), in the case of cube-exchangeability it is a copy of the Poulsen simplex (in which the extreme points are dense). This follows from the arguments used by Glasner and Weiss' for their characterization of property (T) in terms of the geometry of the simplex of invariant measures for associated generalized Bernoulli actions. The emergence of this Poulsen simplex suggests that, if a representation theorem for these processes is available at all, it must take a very different form from the case of set-indexed exchangeable families. 
0808.02269	Descent Construction for Gspin Groups: Main Results and Applications	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Joseph Hundley, Eitan Sayag	Abstract:  The purpose of this note is to announce an extension of the descent method of Ginzburg, Rallis and Soudry to the setting of essentially self dual representations. This extension of the descent construction provides a complement to recent work of Asgari and Shahidi on the generic transfer for general Spin groups as well as to the work of Asgari and Raghuram on cuspidality of the exterior square lift for representations of GL4. Complete proofs of the results announced in the present note will appear in our forthcoming articles. 
0808.02270	Lagrangian Grassmannian in Infinite Dimension	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Esteban Andruchow, Gabriel Larotonda	Abstract:  Given a complex structure $J$ on a real (finite or infinite dimensional) Hilbert space $H$, we study the geometry of the Lagrangian Grassmannian $Λ(H)$ of $H$, i.e. the set of closed linear subspaces $L\subset H$ such that $$J(L)=L^\perp.$$ The complex unitary group $U(H_J)$, consisting of the elements of the orthogonal group of $H$ which are complex linear for the given complex structure, acts transitively on $Λ(H)$ and induces a natural linear connection in $Λ(H)$. It is shown that any pair of Lagrangian subspaces can be joined by a geodesic of this connection. A Finsler metric can also be introduced, if one regards subspaces $L$ as projections $p_L$ (=the orthogonal projection onto $L$) or symmetries $\e_L=2p_L-I$, namely measuring tangent vectors with the operator norm. We show that for this metric the Hopf-Rinow theorem is valid in $Λ(H)$: a geodesic joining a pair of Lagrangian subspaces can be chosen to be of minimal length. We extend these results to the classical Banach-Lie groups of Schatten. 
0808.02271	Kerr-Schild Riemannian acoustic black holes in dynamo plasma laboratory	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Garcia de Andrade	Abstract:  Since Alfven, dynamo and sound waves and the existence of general relativistic black holes are well stablished in plasma physics, this provides enough motivation to investigate the presence of acoustic black-hole effective metric of analogue Einstein's gravity in dynamo flows. From nonlinear dynamo equations, one obtains a non-homogeneous wave equation where it is shown that the non-homogeneous factor is proportional to time evolution of the compressibility factor. In the Navier-Stokes case for a finite Reynolds number the acoustic black-holes also exists on the stretching plasma flows. In the magnetostatic case the dynamo is marginal. Analog models are usually applied to a superfluid analog spacetime, instead of the plasma setting used here. A coupled nonlinear plasma flow solution is found for the dynamo equation where the effective black hole solution of the scalar effective equation yields an imaginary part of the growth of magnetic field. Therefore though the real part of the growth rate of the magnetic field is negative or null, since there is a temporal oscillation in magnetic field, the solution represents a slow dynamo. Thus acoustic black holes are shown to definitely contribute to dynamo action of the effective plasma spacetime. It is suggested that a fast dynamo effective spacetime may also contain an acoustic black hole. I the case of planar waves the effective metric can be cast in Kerr-Schild spacetime form. The Killing symmetries are explicitly given in this metric and the growth of dynamo waves.

0808.02273	A Possible Icy Kuiper Belt around HD 181327	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Christine H. Chen, Michael P. Fitzgerald, Paul S. Smith	Abstract:  We have obtained a Gemini South T-ReCS Qa-band (18.3 micron) image and a Spitzer MIPS SED-mode observation of HD181327, an F5/F6V member of the ~12 Myr old beta Pictoris moving group. We resolve the disk in thermal-emission for the first time and find that the northern arm of the disk is 1.4x brighter than the southern arm. In addition, we detect a broad peak in the combined Spitzer IRS and MIPS spectra at 60 - 75 micron that may be produced by emission from crystalline water ice. We model the IRS and MIPS data using a size distribution of amorphous olivine and water ice grains (dn/da proportional to a^{-2.25} with a_{min} consistent with the minimum blow out size and a_{max} = 20 micron) located at a distance of 86.3 AU from the central star, as observed in previously published scattered-light images. Since the photo-desorption lifetime for the icy particles is ~1400 yr, significantly less than the estimated ~12 Myr age of the system, we hypothesize that we have detected debris that may be steadily replenished by collisions among icy Kuiper belt object-like parent bodies in a newly forming planetary system. 
0808.02274	Finsler geometry and actions of the p-Schatten unitary groups	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Esteban Andruchow, Gabriel Larotonda, Lazaro Recht	Abstract:  Let $p$ be an even positive integer and $U_p(H)$ be the Banach-Lie group of unitary operators $u$ which verify that $u-1$ belongs to the $p$-Schatten ideal $B_p(H)$. Let ${\cal O}$ be a smooth manifold on which $U_p(H)$ acts transitively and smoothly. Then one can endow ${\cal O}$ with a natural Finsler metric in terms of the $p$-Schatten norm and the action of $U_p(H)$. Our main result establishes that for any pair of given initial conditions $$ x\in {\cal O}\hbox{and} X\in (T{\cal O})_x $$ there exists a curve $δ(t)=e^{tz}\cdot x$ in ${\cal O}$, with $z$ a skew-hermitian element in the $p$-Schatten class such that $$ δ(0)=x \hbox{and} \dotδ(0)=X, $$ which remains minimal as long as $t\|z\|_p\le π/4$. Moreover, $δ$ is unique with these properties. We also show that the metric space $({\cal O},d)$ ($d=$ rectifiable distance) is complete. In the process we establish minimality results in the groups $U_p(H)$, and a convexity property for the rectifiable distance. As an example of these spaces, we treat the case of the unitary orbit $$ {\cal O}=\{uAu^*: u\in U_p(H)\} $$ of a self-adjoint operator $A\in B(H)$. 
0808.02275	Norm Inequalities in Operator Ideals	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Gabriel Larotonda	Abstract:  In this paper we introduce a new technique for proving norm inequalities in operator ideals with an unitarily invariant norm. Among the well known inequalities which can be proved with this technique are the Löwner-Heinz inequality, inequalities relating various operator means and the Corach-Porta-Recht inequality. We prove two general inequalities and from them we derive several inequalities by specialization, many of them new. We also show how some inequalities, known to be valid for matrices or bounded operators, can be extended with this technique to normed ideals in $C^*$-algebras, in particular to the noncommutative $L^p$-spaces of a semi-finite von Neumann algebra. 
0808.02276	Some Composite Hadrons and Leptons which induce Supersymmetry Breaking in the Supersymmetric Standard Model: Cybersusy III	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:John Dixon	Abstract:  This is the third paper in a series of four papers which introduce cybersusy, which is a new mechanism for supersymmetry breaking in the supersymmetric standard model (SSM). In this paper we display some solutions to the constraint equations of BRS cohomology in the SSM. In particular we discuss the leptonic dotspinor pseudosupermultiplets that were used in Cybersusy I to calculate leptonic supersymmetry breaking in the supersymmetric standard model. We also introduce examples of hadronic dotspinor pseudosupermultiplets that will induce baryonic supersymmetry breaking in the SSM for the baryons with charge Q=-1, and related supersymmetry partner baryons. Some interesting relationships between the peculiar structure of the SSM, the existence of solutions for the BRS constraints, and supersymmetry breaking using cybersusy are noted. 
0808.02277	Quasi-Hilda Comet 147P/Kushida-Muramatsu: Another long temporary satellite capture by Jupiter	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Katsuhito Ohtsuka, Takashi Ito, Makoto Yoshikawa, David J. Asher, Hideyoshi Arakida	Abstract:  The quasi-Hilda comets (QHCs), being in unstable 3:2 Jovian mean motion resonance, are considered a major cause of temporary satellite capture (TSC) by Jupiter. Though the QHCs may be escaped Hilda asteroids, their origin and nature have not yet been studied in sufficient detail. Of particular interest are long TSCs/orbiters. Orbiters -- in which at least one full revolution about the planet is completed -- are rare astronomical events; only four have been known to occur in the last several decades. Every case has been associated with a QHC: 82P/Gehrels 3; 111P/Helin-Roman-Crockett; P/1996 R2 (Lagerkvist); and the possibly QHC-derived D/1993 F2 (Shoemaker-Levy 9, SL9). We focus on long TSC/orbiter events involving QHCs and Jupiter. Thus we survey the known QHCs, searching for further long TSCs/orbiters over the past century. First, we confirmed the long TSC/orbiter events of 82P, 111P, and 1996 R2 in order to test our method against previous work, applying a general N-body Newtonian code. We then used the same procedure to survey the remaining known QHCs and search for long TSC/orbiter events. We newly identified another long TSC/orbiter: 147P/Kushida-Muramatsu from 1949 May 14 (+97days/-106 days)--1961 July 15. Our result is verified by integrations of 243 cloned orbits which take account of the present orbital uncertainty of this comet. This is the third long TSC and the fifth orbiter to be found, thus long TSC/orbiter events involving Jupiter have occurred once per decade. Two full revolutions about Jupiter were completed and the capture duration was 12.17 (+0.29/-0.27) years; both these numbers rank 147P as third among long TSC/orbiter events, behind SL9 and 111P. This study also confirms the importance of the QHC region as a dynamical route into and out of Jovian TSC, via the Hill's sphere. 
0808.02278	Electrostatic fluctuations in cavities within polar liquids and thermodynamics of polar solvation	Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)	Authors:Daniel R. Martin, Dmitry V. Matyushov	Abstract:  We present the results of numerical simulations of fluctuations of the electrostatic potential and electric field inside cavities created in the fluid of dipolar hard spheres. We found that the thermodynamics of polar solvation dramatically changes its regime when the cavity size becomes about 4-5 times larger than the size of the liquid particle. The range of small cavities can be reasonably understood within the framework of current solvation models. On the contrary, the regime of large cavities is characterized by a significant softening of the cavity interface resulting in a decay of the fluctuation variances with the cavity size much faster than anticipated by both the continuum electrostatics and microscopic theories. For instance, the variance of potential decays with the cavity size $R_0$ approximately as $1/R_0^{4-6}$ instead of the $1/R_0$ scaling expected from standard electrostatics. Our results suggest that cores of non-polar molecular assemblies in polar liquids lose solvation strength much faster than is traditionally anticipated. 
0808.02279	On conformal biharmonic immersions	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Ye-Lin Ou	Abstract:  This paper studies conformal biharmonic immersions. We first study the transformations of Jacobi operator and the bitension field under conformal change of metrics. We then obtain an invariant equation for a conformal biharmonic immersion of a surface into Euclidean 3-space. As applications, we construct a 2-parameter family of non-minimal conformal biharmonic immersions of cylinder into $\r^3$ and some examples of conformal biharmonic immersions of 4-dimensional Euclidean space into sphere and hyperbolic space thus provide many simple examples of proper biharmonic maps with rich geometric meanings. These suggest that there are abundant proper biharmonic maps in the family of conformal immersions. We also explore the relationship between biharmonicity and holomorphicity of conformal immersions of surfaces. 
0808.02280	Spatial Interference: From Coherent To Incoherent	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Su-Heng Zhang, Lu Gao, Jun Xiong, Li-Juan Feng, De-Zhong Cao, Kaige Wang	Abstract:  It is well known that direct observation of interference and diffraction pattern in the intensity distribution requires a spatially coherent source. Optical waves emitted from portions beyond the coherence area possess statistically independent phases, and will degrade the interference pattern. In this paper we show an optical interference experiment, which seems contrary to our common knowledge, that the formation of the interference pattern is related to a spatially incoherent light source. Our experimental scheme is very similar to Gabor's original proposal of holography[1], just with an incoherent source replacing the coherent one. In the statistical ensemble of the incoherent source, each sample field produces a sample interference pattern between object wave and reference wave. These patterns completely differ from each other due to the fluctuation of the source field distribution. Surprisingly, the sum of a great number of sample patterns exhibits explicitly an interference pattern, which contains all the information of the object and is equivalent to a hologram in the coherent light case. In this sense our approach would be valuable in holography and other interference techniques for the case where coherent source is unavailable, such as x-ray and electron sources. 
0808.02281	Attempt frequency of magnetization in nanomagnets with thin-film geometry	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Hong-Ju Suh, Changehoon Heo, Chun-Yeol You, Woojin Kim, Taek-Dong Lee, Kyung-Jin Lee	Abstract:  Solving the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation numerically, we investigate the effect of the potential landscape on the attempt frequency of magnetization in nanomagnets with the thin-film geometry. Numerical estimates of the attempt frequency are analyzed in comparison with theoretical predictions from the Fokker-Planck equation for the Neel-Brown model. It is found that for a nanomagnet with the thin-film geometry, theoretically predicted values for the universal case are in excellent agreement with numerical estimates. 
0808.02282	Candidate Disk Wide Binaries in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Branimir Sesar, Zeljko Ivezic, Mario Juric	Abstract:  Using SDSS Data Release 6, we construct two independent samples of candidate stellar wide binaries selected as i) pairs of unresolved sources with angular separation in the range 3'' - 16'', ii) common proper motion pairs with 5'' - 30'' angular separation, and make them publicly available. These samples are dominated by disk stars, and we use them to constrain the shape of the main-sequence photometric parallax relation M_r(r-i) and to study the properties of wide binary systems. We estimate M_r(r-i) by searching for a relation that minimizes the difference between distance moduli of primary and secondary components of wide binary candidates. We model M_r(r-i) by a fourth degree polynomial and determine the coefficients using Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting, independently for each sample. Aided by the derived photometric parallax relation, we construct a series of high-quality catalogs of candidate main-sequence binary stars. Using these catalogs, we study the distribution of semi-major axes of wide binaries, a, in the 2,000 < a < 47,000 AU range. We find the observations to be well described by the Opik distribution, f(a)~1/a, for a<a_{break}, where a_{break} increases roughly linearly with the height Z above the Galactic plane (a_{break}~12,300 Z[kpc]^0.7 AU). The number of wide binary systems with 100 AU < a < a_{break}, as a fraction of the total number of stars, decreases from 0.9% at Z=0.5 kpc to 0.5% at Z=3 kpc. The probability for a star to be in a wide binary system is independent of its color. Given this color, the companions of red components seem to be drawn randomly from the stellar luminosity function, while blue components have a larger blue-to-red companion ratio than expected from luminosity function. 
0808.02283	Structure, Stability, Edge States and Aromaticity of Graphene Ribbons	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Tobias Wassmann, Ari P. Seitsonen, A. Marco Saitta, Michele Lazzeri, Francesco Mauri	Abstract:  We determine the stability, the geometry, the electronic and magnetic structure of hydrogen-terminated graphene-nanoribbons edges as a function of the hydrogen content of the environment by means of density functional theory. Antiferromagnetic zigzag ribbons are stable only at extremely-low ultra-vacuum pressures. Under more standard conditions, the most stable structures are the mono- and di-hydrogenated armchair edges and a zigzag edge reconstruction with one di- and two mono-hydrogenated sites. At high hydrogen-concentration ``bulk'' graphene is not stable and spontaneously breaks to form ribbons, in analogy to the spontaneous breaking of graphene into small-width nanoribbons observed experimentally in solution. The stability and the existence of exotic edge electronic-states and/or magnetism is rationalized in terms of simple concepts from organic chemistry (Clar's rule) 
0808.02284	Revisiting chameleon gravity - thin-shells and no-shells with appropriate boundary conditions	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Takashi Tamaki, Shinji Tsujikawa	Abstract:  We derive analytic solutions of a chameleon scalar field $φ$ that couples to a non-relativistic matter in the weak gravitational background of a spherically symmetric body, paying particular attention to a field mass $m_A$ inside of the body. The standard thin-shell field profile is recovered by taking the limit $m_A*r_c \to \infty$, where $r_c$ is a radius of the body. We show the existence of "no-shell" solutions where the field is nearly frozen in the whole interior of the body, which does not necessarily correspond to the "zero-shell" limit of thin-shell solutions. In the no-shell case, under the condition $m_A*r_c \gg 1$, the effective coupling of $φ$ with matter takes the same asymptotic form as that in the thin-shell case. We study experimental bounds coming from the violation of equivalence principle as well as solar-system tests for a number of models including $f(R)$ gravity and find that the field is in either the thin-shell or the no-shell regime under such constraints, depending on the shape of scalar-field potentials. We also show that, for the consistency with local gravity constraints, the field at the center of the body needs to be extremely close to the value $φ_A$ at the extremum of an effective potential induced by the matter coupling. 
0808.02285	Impact of the electron-electron correlation on phonon dispersions: failure of LDA and GGA functionals in graphene and graphite	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Michele Lazzeri, Claudio Attaccalite, Ludger Wirtz, Francesco Mauri	Abstract:  We compute electron-phonon coupling (EPC) of selected phonon modes in graphene and graphite using various ab-initio methods. The inclusion of non-local exchange-correlation effects within the GW approach strongly renormalizes the square EPC of the A$'_1$ {\bf K} mode by almost 80$%$ with respect to density functional theory in the LDA and GGA approximations. Within GW, the phonon slope of the A$'_1$ {\bf K} mode is almost two times larger than in GGA and LDA, in agreement with phonon dispersions from inelastic x-ray scattering and Raman spectroscopy. The hybrid B3LYP functional overestimates the EPC at {\bf K} by about 30%. Within the Hartree-Fock approximation, the graphene structure displays an instability under a distortion following the A$'_1$ phonon at {\bf K}.

Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Xiangjun Feng	Abstract:  The Tsallis entropy barrier or the roundness barrier based dynamic stochastic resonance mechanisms are put forward and simulated. The systems with various Tsallis q values exhibit the effects of emergence as a result of the noise-induced cooperative phenomena. 
0808.02287	Bell inequality for qubits based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Jing-Ling Chen, Dong-Ling Deng	Abstract:  We develop a systematic approach to establish Bell inequalities for qubits based on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. We also use the concept of distinct "roots" of Bell function to classify some well-known Bell inequalities for qubits. As applications of the approach, we present three new and tight Bell inequalities for four and three qubits, respectively. 
0808.02288	Narrow escape and leakage of Brownian particles	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:A. Singer, Z. Schuss, D. Holcman	Abstract:  Questions of flux regulation in biological cells raise renewed interest in the narrow escape problem. The often inadequate expansions of the narrow escape time are due to a not so well known fact that the boundary singularity of Green's function for Poisson's equation with Neumann and mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions in three-dimensions contains a logarithmic singularity. Using this fact, we find the second term in the expansion of the narrow escape time and in the expansion of the principal eigenvalue of the Laplace equation with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions, with small Dirichlet and large Neumann parts. We also find the leakage flux of Brownian particles that diffuse from a source to an absorbing target on a reflecting boundary of a domain, if a small perforation is made in the reflecting boundary. 
0808.02289	Factorization Method for d-Dimensional Isotropic Harmonic Oscillator and the Generalized Laguerre Polynomials	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Metin Arık, Melek Baykal, Ahmet Baykal	Abstract:  The factorization method of Infeld and Hull is applied to the radial Schrödinger equation for $d$-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator and various ladder operators are defined. The radial energy eigenstates are expressed in terms of the generalized Laguerre polynomials and their properties are shown to follow from the expressions involving the ladder operators. In the same way as the harmonic oscillator we also obtain the bound energy eigenstates of the Morse oscillator. 
0808.02290	Inhomogeneous Phases in a Double-Exchange Magnet with Long Range Coulomb Interactions	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Gideon Wachtel, Dror Orgad, D. I. Golosov	Abstract:  We consider a model with competing double-exchange (ferromagnetic) and super-exchange (anti-ferromagnetic) interactions in the regime where phase separation takes place. The presence of a long range Coulomb interaction frustrates a macroscopic phase separation, and favors microscopically inhomogeneous configurations. We use the variational Hartree-Fock approach, in conjunction with Monte-Carlo simulations to study the geometry of such configurations in a two-dimensional system. We find that an array of diamond shaped ferromagnetic droplets is the preferred configuration at low electronic densities, while alternating ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic diagonal stripes emerge at higher densities. These findings are expected to be relevant for thin films of colossal magneto-resistive manganates. 
0808.02291	p-q-superstrings in Anti-de-Sitter space-time	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Betti Hartmann, Momchil Minkov (Jacobs University Bremen, Germany)    	Abstract:  We study a field theoretical model for p-q-superstrings in a fixed Anti-de-Sitter background. We find that the presence of the negative cosmological constant tends to decrease the core radius of the strings. Moreover, the binding energy decreases with the increase of the absolute value of the cosmological constant. Studying the effect of the p-q-strings on Anti-de-Sitter space, we observe that the presence of the negative cosmological constant tends to decrease the deficit angle as compared to asymptotically flat space-time. 
0808.02292	Multi-telescope timing of PSR J1518+4904	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:G.H.Janssen (1), B.W. Stappers (2,1,3), M. Kramer (3), D.J. Nice (4), A. Jessner (5), I. Cognard (6), M.B. Purver (3). ((1)University of Amsterdam, NL,(2)Astron, Dwingeloo, NL, (3)JBCA, University of Manchester, UK, (4)Bryn Mawr College, USA, (5)MPIfR, Bonn, DE, (6)CNRS, Orleans, FR)    	Abstract:  PSR J1518+4904 is one of only 9 known double neutron star systems. These systems are highly valuable for measuring the masses of neutron stars, measuring the effects of gravity, and testing gravitational theories. We determine an improved timing solution for a mildly relativistic double neutron star system, combining data from multiple telescopes. We set better constraints on relativistic parameters and the separate masses of the system, and discuss the evolution of PSR J1518+4904 in the context of other double neutron star systems. PSR J1518+4904 has been regularly observed for more than 10 years by the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) network using the Westerbork, Jodrell Bank, Effelsberg and Nancay radio telescopes. The data were analysed using the updated timing software Tempo2. We have improved the timing solution for this double neutron star system. The periastron advance has been refined and a significant detection of proper motion is presented. It is not likely that more post-Keplerian parameters, with which the individual neutron star masses and the inclination angle of the system can be determined separately, can be measured in the near future. Using a combination of the high-quality data sets present in the EPTA collaboration, extended with the original GBT data, we have constrained the masses in the system to m_p<1.17 msun and m_c>1.55 msun (95.4% confidence), and the inclination angle of the orbit to be less than 47 degrees (99%). From this we derive that the pulsar in this system possibly has one of the lowest neutron star masses measured to date. From evolutionary considerations it seems likely that the companion star, despite its high mass, was formed in an electron-capture supernova. 
0808.02293	Spin Dynamics in Iron-based Layered Superconductor (La_{0.87}Ca_{0.13})FePO Revealed by ^{31}P and ^{139}La NMR Studies	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Yusuke Nakai, Kenji Ishida, Yoichi Kamihara, Masahiro Hirano, Hideo Hosono	Abstract:  We report ^{31}P and ^{139}La NMR studies of (La_{0.87}Ca_{0.13})FePO, which is a family member of the recently discovered superconductor LaFeAs(O_{1-x}F_x). In the normal state, Knight shift and $1/T_1T$ show that a Fermi-liquid state with moderate ferromagnetic fluctuations emerges below 30K. From 1/T_1T of ^{31}P and ^{139}La, quasi-two dimensional electronic structure is suggested, in which the FeP layer is more conductive than the LaO layer. In the superconducting (SC) state, although a clear Meissner signal was observed, 1/T_1T increases below T_c, in contrast to a decrease of 1/T_1T due to the opening of a SC gap, suggesting that novel low-energy spin dynamics develop in the SC state. 
0808.02294	Sound Waves Excitation by Jet-Inflated Bubbles in Clusters of Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Assaf Sternberg (Technion, Israel)Noam Soker (Technion, Israel)    	Abstract:  We show that repeated sound waves in the intracluster medium (ICM) can be excited by a single inflation episode of an opposite bubble pair. To reproduce this behavior in numerical simulations the bubbles should be inflated by jets, rather than being injected artificially. The multiple sound waves are excited by the motion of the bubble-ICM boundary that is caused by vortices inside the inflated bubbles and the backflow (`cocoon') of the ICM around the bubble. These sound waves form a structure that can account for the ripples observed in the Perseus cooling flow cluster. We inflate the bubbles using slow massive jets, with either a wide opening angle or that are precessing. The jets are slow in the sense that they are highly sub-relativistic, $v_j \sim 0.01c-0.1c$, and they are massive in the sense that the pair of bubbles carry back to the ICM a large fraction of the cooling mass, i.e., $\sim 1-50 M_\odot \yr^{-1}$. We use a two-dimensional axisymmetric (referred to as 2.5D) hydrodynamical numerical code (VH-1). 
0808.02295	Dynamics of grain ejection by sphere impact on a granular bed	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Stéphanie Deboeuf (LPS), Philippe Gondret (FAST), Marc Rabaud (FAST)    	Abstract:  The dynamics of grain ejection consecutive to a sphere impacting a granular material is investigated experimentally and the variations of the characteristics of grain ejection with the control parameters are quantitatively studied. The time evolution of the corona formed by the ejected grains is reported, mainly in terms of its diameter and height, and favourably compared with a simple ballistic model. A key characteristic of the granular corona is that the angle formed by its edge with the horizontal granular surface remains constant during the ejection process, which again can be reproduced by the ballistic model. The number and the kinetic energy of the ejected grains is evaluated and allows for the calculation of an effective restitution coefficient characterizing the complex collision process between the impacting sphere and the fine granular target. The effective restitution coefficient is found to be constant when varying the control parameters. 
0808.02296	Fixed-Point Design of Generalized Comb Filters: A Statistical Approach	Other Computer Science (cs.OH)	Authors:Massimiliano Laddomada	Abstract:  This paper is concerned with the problem of designing computationally efficient Generalized Comb Filters (GCF). Basically, GCF filters are anti-aliasing filters that guarantee superior performance in terms of selectivity and quantization noise rejection compared to classical comb filters, when used as decimation filters in multistage architectures. Upon employing a partial polyphase (PP) architecture proposed in a companion paper, we develop a sensitivity analysis in order to investigate the effects of the coefficients' quantization on the frequency response of the designed filters. We show that the sensitivity of the filter response to errors in the coefficients is dependent on the particular split of the decimation factor between the two sub-filters constituting the PP architecture. The sensitivity analysis is then used for developing a fixed-point implementation of a sample filter from the class of GCF filters, used as reference filter throughout the paper. Finally, we present computer simulations in order to evaluate the performance of the designed fixed-point filters. 
0808.02297	Duality Relation for the Hilbert Series of Almost Symmetric Numerical Semigroups	Commutative Algebra (math.AC)	Authors:Leonid G. Fel	Abstract:  We derive the duality relation for the Hilbert series H(d^m;z) of almost symmetric numerical semigroup S(d^m) combining it with its dual H(d^m;z^{-1}). On this basis we establish the bijection between the multiset of degrees of the syzygy terms and the multiset of the gaps F_j, generators d_i and their linear combinations. We present the relations for the sums of the Betti numbers of even and odd indices separately. We apply the duality relation to the simple case of the almost symmetric semigroups of maximal embedding dimension, and give the necessary and efficient conditions for minimal set d^m to generate such semigroups. 
0808.02298	Light Stop Searches at the LHC in Events with One Hard Photon or Jet and Missing Energy	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:M. Carena, A. Freitas, C.E.M. Wagner	Abstract:  Low energy supersymmetric models provide a solution to the hierarchy problem and also have the necessary ingredients to solve two of the most outstanding issues in cosmology: the origin of the baryon asymmetry and the source of dark matter. In the MSSM, weak scale generation of the baryon asymmetry may be achieved in the presence of light stops, with masses lower than about 130 GeV. Moreover, the proper dark matter density may be obtained in the stop-neutralino co-annihilation region, where the stop-neutralino mass difference is smaller than a few tens of GeV. Searches for scalar top quarks (stops) in pair production processes at the Tevatron and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) become very challenging in this region of parameters. At the LHC, however, light stops proceeding from the decay of gluino pairs may be identified, provided the gluino mass is smaller than about 900 GeV. In this article we propose an alternative method for stop searches in the co-annihilation region, based on the search for these particles in events with missing energy plus one hard photon or jet. We show that this method is quite efficient and, when complemented with ongoing Tevatron searches, allows to probe stop masses up to about 160 GeV, fully probing the region of parameters consistent with electroweak baryogenesis in the MSSM.

0808.02300	Understanding Dilepton Production in Heavy Ion Collisions by Vector Mesons of Different Varieties	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Gerald E. Brown, Jeremy W. Holt, Mannque Rho	Abstract:  A simple schematic model anchored on the notion of hadronic freedom inferred from hidden local symmetry in the vector manifestation, the infinite tower of vector mesons in holographic QCD and "stickiness" of $ππ$ interactions inferred from dispersion relations is used to describe the dileptons produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions at PHENIX/RHIC. It is shown that due to the near "blindness" of dileptons to Brown-Rho scaling, those dileptons with invariant mass less than $m_ρ=770$ MeV come mostly from pion-composites that we interpret as "transient $ρ$'s." 
0808.02301	Detailed Calculations of the Mass Spectrum for the Leptons after Supersymmetry Breaking in the Supersymmetric Standard Model: Cybersusy IV	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:John Dixon	Abstract:  This is the fourth of a series of four papers introducing cybersusy, which is a new approach to supersymmetry breaking in the supersymmetric standard model. This paper contains a brief summary, and then goes on to the calculation of the propagators and masses for the leptons, using the cybersusy action deduced in the three previous papers of this series. The results here are for the general case of three flavours of leptons. 
0808.02302	Application of the density functional theory to the fuel cell problem	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Sergey Stolbov Marisol Alcántara_Ortigoza Talat S. Rahman	Abstract:  The large-scale practical application of fuel cells in hydrogen economy is possible only with a dramatic reduction of the cost coupled with a significant improvement of the electrocatalytic properties of the electrodes. This goal can be achieved through a rational design of new materials, which requires understanding of the microscopic mechanisms underlying the electrocatalysis. We discuss some applications of the density functional theory to this problem using using alloying of Ru with Pt as the case in point. We provide some details for Pt islets on Ru nanoparticles, for which our calculations explain the high CO tolerance observed for such anodes of the fuel cell. We also discuss energetics responsible for the stability of these islets on the nanoparticles.

(Universidad de Pamplona, Colombia), Carlos A. Ramirez (Universidad Industrial de Santander, Colombia)    	Abstract:  We consider B to PS decays where P stands for pseudoscalar and S for a heavy (~1500 MeV) scalar meson. We achieve agreement with available experimental data -- which includes a two orders of magnitude hierarchy -- assuming the scalars mesons are two quark states. The contribution of the dipolar penguin operator O_{11} is quantified. 
0808.02306	Quantum state transfer with untuneable couplings	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:P.K. Gagnebin, S. Skinner, E.C. Behrman, J.E. Steck	Abstract:  We present a general scheme for implementing bi-directional quantum state transfer in a quantum swapping channel. Unlike many other schemes for quantum computation and communication, our method does not require qubit couplings to be switched on and off. The only control variable is the bias acting on individual qubits. We show how to derive the parameters of the system (fixed and variable) such that perfect state transfer can be achieved. Since these parameters vary linearly with the pulse width, our scheme allows flexibility in the time scales under which qubits evolve. Unlike quantum spin networks, our scheme allows the transmission of several quantum states at a time, requiring only a two qubit separation between quantum states. By pulsing the biases of several qubits at the same time, we show that only eight bias control lines are required to achieve state transfer along a channel of arbitrary length. Furthermore, when the information to be transferred is purely classical in nature, only three bias control lines are required, greatly simplifying the circuit complexity. 
0808.02307	Boolean complexes for Ferrers graphs	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Anders Claesson, Sergey Kitaev, Kari Ragnarsson, Bridget Eileen Tenner	Abstract:  In this paper we provide an explicit formula for calculating the boolean number of a Ferrers graph. By previous work of the last two authors, this determines the homotopy type of the boolean complex of the graph. Specializing to staircase shapes, we show that the boolean numbers of the associated Ferrers graphs are the Genocchi numbers of the second kind, and obtain a relation between the Legendre-Stirling numbers and the Genocchi numbers of the second kind. In another application, we compute the boolean number of a complete bipartite graph, corresponding to a rectangular Ferrers shape, which is expressed in terms of the Stirling numbers of the second kind. Finally, we analyze the complexity of calculating the boolean number of a Ferrers graph using these results and show that it is a significant improvement over calculating by edge recursion. 
0808.02308	The arithmetic-geometric scaling spectrum for continued fractions	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Johannes Jaerisch, Marc Kesseböhmer	Abstract:  To compare continued fraction digits with the denominators of the corresponding approximants we introduce the arithmetic-geometric scaling. We will completely determine its multifractal spectrum by means of a number theoretical free energy function and show that the Hausdorff dimension of sets consisting of irrationals with the same scaling exponent coincides with the Legendre transform of this free energy function. Furthermore, we identify the asymptotic of the local behaviour of the spectrum at the right boundary point and discuss a connection to the set of irrationals with continued fraction digits exceeding a given number which tends to infinity. 
0808.02309	Modulated electronic configurations in selectively doped multilayered nanostructures	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:V. M. Loktev, Yu. G. Pogorelov	Abstract:  A simple theoretical model is proposed to describe the recent experimental results on formation of induced superconducting state and anomalous tunneling characteristics in selectively doped multilayered nanostructures based on La$_2$CuO$_4$ perovskite. In particular, it is shown that the structure composed from the nominally non-superconducting (undoped and overdoped) layers turns to be superconducting with superconductivity confined to narrow regions near the interfaces, in agreement with the experimental observations. 
0808.02310	On a possibility of a UV finite N=8 supergravity	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Renata Kallosh	Abstract:  The Lorentz covariant all-loop counterterms built in the 4+32 on shell superspace of N=8 supergravity imply that the theory is not UV finite. Meanwhile, the relevant counterterms depending on the light-cone superfields in 4+16 superspace have not been constructed so far. Our first attempt to construct them suggests that they may be incompatible with the covariant ones. This would lead to a prediction of all-loop UV finiteness of the perturbative S-matrix. Here we rely on the validity of the equivalence theorem for the S-matrix in the light-cone gauge and Lorentz covariant gauges, which requires the absence of BRST anomalies. We discuss the status of N=8 SU(8) and E7 anomalies. It remains an outstanding problem to construct the light-cone counterterms or to confirm our current conclusion. 
0808.02311	Gamma-invariant ideals in Iwasawa algebras	Rings and Algebras (math.RA)	Authors:K. Ardakov, S. J. Wadsley	Abstract:  Let kG be the completed group algebra of a uniform pro-p group G with coefficients in a field k of characteristic p. We study right ideals I in kG that are invariant under the action of another uniform pro-p group Gamma. We prove that if I is non-zero then an irreducible component of the characteristic support of kG/I must be contained in a certain finite union of rational linear subspaces of Spec gr kG. The minimal codimension of these subspaces gives a lower bound on the homological height of I in terms of the action of a certain Lie algebra on G/G^p. If we take Gamma to be G acting on itself by conjugation, then Gamma-invariant right ideals of kG are precisely the two-sided ideals of kG, and we obtain a non-trivial lower bound on the homological height of a possible non-zero two-sided ideal. For example, when G is open in SL_n(\Zp) this lower bound equals 2n - 2. This gives a significant improvement of the results of Ardakov, Wei and Zhang on reflexive ideals in Iwasawa algebras. 
0808.02312	Hydroanalysis of Animal Lysozymes c and Human Defensins a	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:J. C. Phillips	Abstract:  Proteins appear to be the most dramatic natural example of self-organized criticality (SOC), a concept that explains many otherwise apparently unlikely phenomena. Protein functionality is dominated by long range hydro(phobic/philic) interactions which both drive protein compaction and mediate protein-protein interactions. In contrast to previous reductionist short range hydrophobicity scales, the holistic Moret-Zebende hydrophobicity scale represents a hydroanalytic tool that bioinformatically quantifies SOC in a way fully compatible with evolution. Hydroprofiling identifies chemical trends in the activities and substrate binding abilities of model enzymes and antibiotic animal lysozymes c and antibiotic human defensins, which have been the subject of tens of thousands of experimental studies. The analysis is simple and easily performed, and immediately yields insights not obtainable by traditional methods based on short-range real-space interactions, as described either by classical force fields (CFF) used in molecular dynamics simulations (MDS), or hydrophobicity scales based on transference energies from water to organic solvents. 
0808.02313	The impact of dust on the scaling properties of galaxy clusters	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Antonio C. da Silva, Andrea Catalano, Ludovic Montier, Etienne Pointecouteau, Joseph Lanoux, Martin Giard	Abstract:  We investigate the effect of dust on the scaling properties of galaxy clusters based on hydrodynamic N-body simulations of structure formation. We have simulated five dust models plus a radiative cooling and adiabatic models using the same initial conditions for all runs. The numerical implementation of dust was based on the analytical computations of Montier and Giard (2004). We set up dust simulations to cover different combinations of dust parameters that put in evidence the effects of size and abundance of dust grains. Comparing our radiative plus dust cooling runs to a purely radiative cooling simulation we find that dust has an impact on cluster scaling relations. It mainly affects the normalisation of the scalings (and their evolution), whereas it introduces no significant differences on their slopes. The strength of the effect depends critically on the dust abundance and grain size parameters as well as on the cluster scaling. Indeed, cooling due to dust is effective at the cluster regime and has a stronger effect on the "baryon driven" statistical properties of clusters such as $L_{\rm X}-M$, $Y- M$, $S-M$ scaling relations. Major differences, relative to the radiative cooling model, are as high as 25% for the $L_{\rm X}-M$ normalisation, and about 10% for the $Y-M$ and $S-M$ normalisations at redshift zero. On the other hand, we find that dust has almost no impact on the "dark matter driven" $T_{\rm mw}-M$ scaling relation. The effects are found to be dependent in equal parts on both dust abundances and grain sizes distributions for the scalings investigated in this paper. Higher dust abundances and smaller grain sizes cause larger departures from the radiative cooling (i.e. with no dust) model. 
0808.02314	Capacity of Symmetric K-User Gaussian Very Strong Interference Channels	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Sriram Sridharan, Amin Jafarian, Sriram Vishwanath, Syed A. Jafar	Abstract:  This paper studies a symmetric K user Gaussian interference channel with K transmitters and K receivers. A "very strong" interference regime is derived for this channel setup. A "very strong" interference regime is one where the capacity region of the interference channel is the same as the capacity region of the channel with no interference. In this regime, the interference can be perfectly canceled by all the receivers without incurring any rate penalties. A "very strong" interference condition for an example symmetric K user deterministic interference channel is also presented. 
0808.02315	Frequency-domain calculation of the self force: the high-frequency problem and its resolution	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Leor Barack, Amos Ori, Norichika Sago	Abstract:  The mode-sum method provides a practical means for calculating the self force acting on a small particle orbiting a larger black hole. In this method, one first computes the spherical-harmonic $l$-mode contributions $F^μ_l$ of the "full force" field $F^μ$, evaluated at the particle's location, and then sums over $l$ subject to a certain regularization procedure. In the frequency-domain variant of this scheme the quantities $F^μ_l$ are obtained by fully decomposing the particle's self field into Fourier-harmonic modes $l m ω$, calculating the contribution of each such mode to $F^μ_l$, and then summing over $ω$ and $m$ for given $l$. This procedure has the advantage that one only encounters {\it ordinary} differential equations. However, for eccentric orbits, the sum over $ω$ is found to converge badly at the particle's location. This problem (reminiscent of the familiar Gibbs phenomenon) results from the discontinuity of the time-domain $F^μ_l$ field at the particle's worldline. Here we propose a simple and practical method to resolve this problem. The method utilizes the {\it homogeneous} modes $l m ω$ of the self field to construct $F^μ_l$ (rather than the inhomogeneous modes, as in the standard method), which guarantees an exponentially-fast convergence to the correct value of $F^μ_l$, even at the particle's location. We illustrate the application of the method with the example of the monopole scalar-field perturbation from a scalar charge in an eccentric orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. Our method, however, should be applicable to a wider range of problems, including the calculation of the gravitational self-force using either Teukolsky's formalism, or a direct integration of the metric perturbation equations. 
0808.02316	A new secant method for unconstrained optimization	Optimization and Control (math.OC)	Authors:Stephen A. Vavasis	Abstract:  We present a gradient-based algorithm for unconstrained minimization derived from iterated linear change of basis. The new method is equivalent to linear conjugate gradient in the case of a quadratic objective function. In the case of exact line search it is a secant method. In practice, it performs comparably to BFGS and DFP and is sometimes more robust. 
0808.02317	Evidence of convective rolls in a sunspot penumbra	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:V. Zakharov, J. Hirzberger, T. L. Riethmueller, S. K. Solanki, P. Kobel	Abstract:  aims: We study the recently discovered twisting motion of bright penumbral filaments with the aim of constraining their geometry and the associated magnetic field. methods: A large sunspot located $40\degr$ from disk center was observed at high resolution with the 1-m Swedish Solar Telescope. Inversions of multi-wavelength polarimetric data and speckle reconstructed time series of continuum images were used to determine proper motions, as well as the velocity and magnetic structure in penumbral filaments. results: The continuum movie reveals apparent lateral motions of bright and dark structures inside bright filaments oriented parallel to the limb, confirming recent Hinode results. In these filaments we measure upflows of $\approx 1.1 \mathrm{km/s}$ on their limbward side and weak downflows on their centerward side. The magnetic field in them is significantly weaker and more horizontal than in the adjacent dark filaments. conclusions: The data indicate the presence of vigorous convective rolls in filaments with a nearly horizontal magnetic field. These are separated by filaments harbouring stronger, more vertical fields. Because of reduced gas pressure, we see deeper into the latter. When observed near the limb, the disk-centerward side of the horizontal-field filaments appear bright due to the \textit{hot wall} effect known from faculae. We estimate that the convective rolls transport most of the energy needed to explain the penumbral radiative flux. 
0808.02318	Thermal Relics in Hidden Sectors	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Jonathan L. Feng, Huitzu Tu, Hai-Bo Yu	Abstract:  Dark matter may be hidden, with no standard model gauge interactions. At the same time, in WIMPless models with hidden matter masses proportional to hidden gauge couplings squared, the hidden dark matter's thermal relic density may naturally be in the right range, preserving the key quantitative virtue of WIMPs. We consider this possibility in detail. We first determine model-independent constraints on hidden sectors from Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background. Contrary to conventional wisdom, large hidden sectors are easily accommodated. A flavour-free version of the standard model is allowed if the hidden sector is just 30% colder than the observable sector after reheating. Alternatively, if the hidden sector contains a 1-generation version of the standard model with characteristic mass scale below 1 MeV, even identical reheating temperatures are allowed. We then analyze hidden sector freezeout in detail for a concrete model, solving the Boltzmann equation numerically and understanding the results from both observable and hidden sector points of view. We find that WIMPless dark matter indeed obtains the correct relic density for masses in the range keV < m_X < TeV. The upper bound results from the requirement of perturbativity, and the lower bound assumes that the observable and hidden sectors reheat to the same temperature and is raised to the MeV scale if the hidden sector is 10 times colder. WIMPless dark matter therefore generalizes the WIMP paradigm to the largest mass range possible for viable thermal relics and provides a unified framework for exploring dark matter signals across nine orders of magnitude in dark matter mass. 
0808.02319	Fitting Martingales To Given Marginals	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:George Lowther	Abstract:  We consider the problem of finding a real valued martingale fitting specified marginal distributions. For this to be possible, the marginals must be increasing in the convex order and have constant mean. We show that, under the extra condition that they are weakly continuous, the marginals can always be fitted in a unique way by a martingale which lies in a particular class of strong Markov processes. It is also shown that the map that this gives from the sets of marginal distributions to the martingale measures is continuous. Furthermore, we prove that it is the unique continuous method of fitting martingale measures to the marginal distributions. 
0808.02320	Creation of high-quality long-distance entanglement with flexible resources	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Bing He, Yu-Hang Ren, Janos A. Bergou	Abstract:  We present a quantum repeater protocol that generates the elementary segments of entangled photons through the communication of qubus in coherent states. The input photons at the repeater stations can be in arbitrary states to save the local state preparation time for the operations. The flexibility of the scheme accelerates the generation of the elementary segments (close to the exact Bell states) to a high rate for practical quantum communications. The entanglement connection to long distances is simplified and sped up, possibly realizing an entangled pair of high quality within the time in the order of that for classical communication between two far-away locations.

0808.02322	A multi-etiology model of systemic degeneration in schizophrenia	Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)	Authors:Anca Radulescu	Abstract:  We discuss the possibility of multiple underlying etiologies of the condition currently labeled as schizophrenia. We support this hypothesis with a theoretical model of the prefrontal-limbic system. We show how the dynamical behavior of this model depends on an entire set of physiological parameters, representing synaptic strengths, vulnerability to stress-induced cortisol, dopamine regulation and rates of autoantibody production. Malfunction of different such parameters produces similar outward dysregulation of the system, which may readily lead to diagnosis difficulties in a clinician's office. We further place this paradigm within the contexts of pathophysiology and of antipsychotic pharmacology. We finally propose brain profiling as the future quantitative diagnostic toolbox that agrees with a multiple etiologies hypothesis of schizophrenia. 
0808.02323	The 21cm Power Spectrum After Reionization	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Stuart Wyithe, Abraham Loeb	Abstract:  We discuss the 21cm power spectrum (PS) following the completion of reionization. In contrast to the reionization era, this PS is proportional to the PS of mass density fluctuations, with only a small modulation due to fluctuations in the ionization field on scales larger than the mean-free-path of ionizing photons. We derive the form of this modulation, and demonstrate that its effect on the 21cm PS will be smaller than 1% for physically plausible models of damped Ly-alpha systems. In contrast to the 21cm PS observed prior to reionization, in which HII regions dominate the ionization structure, the simplicity of the 21cm PS after reionization will enhance its utility as a cosmological probe by removing the need to separate the PS into physical and astrophysical components. As a demonstration, we consider the Alcock-Paczynski test and show that the next generation of low-frequency arrays could measure the angular distortion of the PS at the percent level for z~3-5. 
0808.02324	On Stability of Pseudo-Conformal Blowup for L^2-critical Hartree NLS	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Joachim Krieger, Enno Lenzmann, Pierre Raphael	Abstract:  We consider $L^2$-critical focusing nonlinear Schroedinger equations with Hartree type nonlinearity $$i \pr_t u = -\DD u - \big (Φ\ast |u|^2 \big) u \quad {in $\RR^4$},$$ where $Φ(x)$ is a perturbation of the convolution kernel $|x|^{-2}$. Despite the lack of pseudo conformal invariance for this equation, we prove the existence of critical mass finite-time blowup solutions $u(t,x)$ that exhibit the pseudo-conformal blowup rate $$ \| \nabla u(t) \|_{L^2_x} \sim \frac{1}{|t|} \quad {as} \quad t \nearrow 0 . $$ Furthermore, we prove the finite-codimensional stability of this conformal blow up, by extending the nonlinear wave operator construction by Bourgain and Wang (see \cite{Bourgain+Wang1997}) to $L^2$-critical Hartree NLS. 
0808.02325	Networking in the Physical World	Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)	Authors:Michael Neufeld, Craig Partridge	Abstract:  In this work we propose a network meta-architecture based on fundamental laws of physics and a physical model of computation. This meta-architecture may be used to frame discussions about novel network architectures as well as cross-layer alterations to the canonical network stack. 
0808.02326	Electromagnetic Transition Form Factors of Nucleon Resonances	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:Volker D. Burkert	Abstract:  Recent measurements of nucleon resonance transition form factors with CLAS at Jefferson Lab are discussed. The new data resolve a long-standing puzzle of the nature of the Roper resonance, and confirm the assertion of the symmetric constituent quark model of the Roper as the first radial excitation of the nucleon. The data on $nπ^+$ production at high $Q^2$ confirm the slow fall off of the $S_{11}(1535)$ transition form factor with $Q^2$, and better constrain the branching ratios $β_{Nπ}=0.50$ and $β_{Nη}=0.45$. Also, new results on the transition amplitudes for the $D_{13}(1520)$ resonance are presented showing a rapid change from helicity 3/2 dominance seen at the real photon point to helicty 1/2 dominance at higher $Q^2$. 
0808.02327	Deformed boson-fermion correspondence, Q-bosons, and topological strings on the conifold	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Piotr Sułkowski	Abstract:  We consider two different physical systems for which the basis of the Hilbert space can be parametrized by Young diagrams: free complex fermions and the phase model of strongly correlated bosons. Both systems have natural, well-known deformations parametrized by a parameter Q: the former one is related to the deformed boson-fermion correspondence introduced by N. Jing, while the latter is the so-called Q-boson, arising also in the context of quantum groups. These deformations are equivalent and can be realized in the same way in the algebra of Hall-Littlewood symmetric functions. Without a deformation, these reduce to Schur functions, which can be used to construct a generating function of plane partitions, reproducing a topological string partition function on $C^3$. We show that a deformation of both systems leads then to a deformed generating function, which reproduces topological string partition function of the conifold, with the deformation parameter Q identified with the size of $P^1$. Similarly, a deformation of the fermion one-point function results in the A-brane partition function on the conifold. 
0808.02328	Parent Phases of Doped Mott Insulators: A Cluster DMFT Study	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Jean-Christophe Domenge, Gabriel Kotliar	Abstract:  We investigate the insulating phases of a frustrated Hubbard model in its strong coupling regime at half-filling. We pay special attention to all the symmetry breaking instabilities that can be described by Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) on a square plaquette. We identify several mean-field solutions, two Neel states breaking the SU(2) symmetry, a dimer phase and a Mott insulator which doesn't break any symmetry. The singlet to singlet fluctuations soften dramatically in the latter phase, giving rise to dimerization fluctuations as well as chiral fluctuations that are both low-lying. We present a simple picture of the different DMFT states and their evolution with frustration. 
0808.02329	Local Coarse-grained Approximation to Path Integral Monte Carlo Integration for Fermion Systems	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:D. Y. Sun	Abstract:  An approximate treatment of exchange in finite-temperature path integral Monte Carlo simulations for fermions has been proposed. In this method, some of the fine details of density matrix due to permutations have been smoothed over or averaged out by using the coarse-grained approximation. The practical usefulness of the method is tested for interacting fermions in a three dimensional harmonic well. The results show that, the present method not only reduces the sign fluctuation of the density matrix, but also avoid the fermion system collapsing into boson system at low temperatures. The method is substantiated to be exact when applied to free particles. 
0808.02330	Noncommutative BTZ Black Hole in Polar Coordinates	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Ee Chang-Young, Daeho Lee, Youngone Lee	Abstract:  Based on the equivalence between the three dimensional gravity and the Chern-Simons theory, we obtain a noncommutative BTZ black hole solution as a solution of $U(1,1)\times U(1,1)$ noncommutative Chern-Simons theory using the Seiberg-Witten map. The Seiberg-Witten map is carried out in a noncommutative polar coordinates whose commutation relation is equivalent to the usual canonical commutation relation in the rectangular coordinates up to first order in the noncommutativity parameter $θ$. The solution exhibits a characteristic of noncommutative polar coordinates in such a way that the apparent horizon and the Killing horizon coincide only in the non-rotating limit showing the effect of noncommutativity between the radial and angular coordinates. 
0808.02331	Magnetic and charge transport properties of the Na-based Os oxide pyrochlore	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Y.G. Shi, A.A. Belik, M. Tachibana, M. Tanaka, Y. Katsuya, K. Kobayashi, K. Yamaura, E. Takayama-Muromachi	Abstract:  Na-based osmium oxide pyrochlore was synthesized for the first time by an ion-exchange method. KOs2O6 was used as a host compound. Elelectron probe micro-analysis, synchrotron x-ray diffraction analysis, and thermo-gravimetric analysis confirmed its structure not as the beta-type but as the defect-type pyrochlore. The composition was identified as Na1.4Os2O6.H2O. Electrical resistivity, heat capacity, and magnetization measurements of the polycrystalline Na1.4Os2O6.H2O clarified absence of superconductivity above 2 K, being in contrast to what were found for the beta-pyrochlore AOs2O6 (A = Cs, Rb, K). Sommerfeld coefficient of 22 mJ K-2 mol-1 of Na1.4Os2O6.H2O was smallest among those of AOs2O6. A magnetic anomaly at ~57 K and possible associated magnetoresistance (+3.7 % at 2 K in 70 kOe) were found. 
0808.02332	Reducing the Variance of Likelihood Ratio Greeks with Monte Carlo	Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)	Authors:Luca Capriotti	Abstract:  We investigate the use of Antithetic Variables, Control Variates and Importance Sampling to reduce the statistical errors of option sensitivities calculated with the Likelihood Ratio Method in Monte Carlo. We show how Antithetic Variables solve the well-known problem of the divergence of the variance of Delta for short maturities and small volatilities. With numerical examples within a Gaussian Copula framework, we show how simple Control Variates and Importance Sampling strategies provide computational savings up to several orders of magnitude. 
0808.02333	Equivalence Classes of Boundary Conditions in Gauge Theory on $Z_3$ Orbifold	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Yoshiharu Kawamura, Teppei Kinami, Takeshi Miura	Abstract:  We study equivalence classes of boundary conditions in gauge theory on the orbifold $T^2/Z_3$. Orbifold conditions and those gauge transformation properties are given and the gauge equivalence is understood by the Hosotani mechanism. Mode expansions are carried out for six-dimensional $Z_3$ singlet fields and a $Z_3$ triplet field, and the one-loop effective potential for Wilson line phases is calculated. 
0808.02334	Distortion elements in $Diff^\infty(R/Z)$	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Artur Avila	Abstract:  We consider the group of smooth diffeomorphisms of the circle. We show that any recurrent $f$ (in the sense that $\{f^n\}_{n \in Z}$ is not discrete) is in fact a distortion element (in the sense that its iterates can be written as short compositions involving finitely many smooth diffeomorphisms). Thus rotations are distortion elements. 
0808.02335	Can local bulk effects explain the galactic dark matter?	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Malihe Heydari-Fard, Hamid R. Sepangi	Abstract:  We obtain the virial theorem within the context of a brane-world model without mirror symmetry or any form of junction condition. Taking a constant curvature bulk (neglecting non-local bulk effects), the local bulk effects generate a geometrical mass, contributing to the gravitational energy which may be used to explain the virial mass discrepancy in clusters of galaxies. We fix the parameter of this model in agreement with observational data. 
0808.02336	Khovanov homology, open books, and tight contact structures	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:John A. Baldwin, Olga Plamenevskaya	Abstract:  We define the reduced Khovanov homology of an open book (S,h), and we identify a distinguished "contact element" in this group which may be used to establish the tightness or non-fillability of contact structures compatible with (S,h). Our construction generalizes the relationship between the reduced Khovanov homology of a link and the Heegaard Floer homology of its branched double cover. As an application, we give combinatorial proofs of tightness for several contact structures which are not Stein-fillable. Lastly, we investigate a comultiplication structure on the reduced Khovanov homology of an open book which parallels the comultiplication on Heegaard Floer homology defined previously by the first author. 
0808.02337	Decomposable Principal Component Analysis	Machine Learning (stat.ML)	Authors:Ami Wiesel, Alfred O. Hero III	Abstract:  We consider principal component analysis (PCA) in decomposable Gaussian graphical models. We exploit the prior information in these models in order to distribute its computation. For this purpose, we reformulate the problem in the sparse inverse covariance (concentration) domain and solve the global eigenvalue problem using a sequence of local eigenvalue problems in each of the cliques of the decomposable graph. We demonstrate the application of our methodology in the context of decentralized anomaly detection in the Abilene backbone network. Based on the topology of the network, we propose an approximate statistical graphical model and distribute the computation of PCA. 
0808.02338	Axisymmetric Magnetorotational Instability in Viscous Accretion Disks	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Youhei Masada (1), Takayoshi Sano (2) ((1) Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, (2) Institute of Laser Enginnering Osaka University)    	Abstract:  Axisymmetric magnetorotational instability (MRI) in viscous accretion disks is investigated by linear analysis and two-dimensional nonlinear simulations. The linear growth of the viscous MRI is characterized by the Reynolds number defined as $R_{\rm MRI} \equiv v_A^2/νΩ$, where $v_A$ is the Alfv{é}n velocity, $ν$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $Ω$ is the angular velocity of the disk. Although the linear growth rate is suppressed considerably as the Reynolds number decreases, the nonlinear behavior is found to be almost independent of $R_{\rm MRI}$. At the nonlinear evolutionary stage, a two-channel flow continues growing and the Maxwell stress increases until the end of calculations even though the Reynolds number is much smaller than unity. A large portion of the injected energy to the system is converted to the magnetic energy. The gain rate of the thermal energy, on the other hand, is found to be much larger than the viscous heating rate. Nonlinear behavior of the MRI in the viscous regime and its difference from that in the highly resistive regime can be explained schematically by using the characteristics of the linear dispersion relation. Applying our results to the case with both the viscosity and resistivity, it is anticipated that the critical value of the Lundquist number $S_{\rm MRI} \equiv v_A^2/ηΩ$ for active turbulence depends on the magnetic Prandtl number $S_{{\rm MRI},c} \propto Pm^{1/2}$ in the regime of $Pm \gg 1$ and remains constant when $Pm \ll 1$, where $Pm \equiv S_{\rm MRI}/R_{\rm MRI} = ν/η$ and $η$ is the magnetic diffusivity. 
0808.02339	The Nature of a Cosmic-Ray Accelerator, CTB37 B, Observed with Suzaku and Chandra	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ryoko Nakamura, Aya Bamba, Manabu Ishida, Hiroshi Nakajima, Ryo Yamazaki, Yukikatsu Terada, Gerd Puhlhofer, Stefan J. Wagner	Abstract:  We report on Suzaku and Chandra observations of the young supernova remnant CTB37B, from which TeV gamma-rays were detected by the H.E.S.S. Cherenkov telescope. The 80 ks Suzaku observation provided us with a clear image of diffuse emission and high-quality spectra. The spectra revealed that the diffuse emission is comprised of thermal and non-thermal components. The thermal component can be represented by an NEI model with a temperature, a pre-shock electron density and an age of 0.9(0.7-1.1) keV, 0.4(0.3-0.5) cm^{-3} and 650(350-3150) yr, respectively. This suggests that the explosion of CTB37B occurred in a low-density space. A non-thermal power-law component was found from the southern region of CTB37B. Its photon index of ~1.5 and a high roll-off energy (>15 keV) indicate efficient cosmic-ray acceleration. A comparison of this X-ray spectrum with the TeV gamma-ray spectrum leads us to conclude that the TeV gamma-ray emission seems to be powered by either multi-zone Inverse Compton scattering or the decay of neutral pions. The point source resolved by Chandra near the shell is probably associated with CTB37B, because of the common hydrogen column density with the diffuse thermal emission. Spectral and temporal characteristics suggest that this source is a new anomalous X-ray pulsar. 
0808.02340	Le problème des diviseurs pour des formes binaires de degré 4	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:R. de la Bretèche, T.D. Browning	Abstract:  We study the average order of the divisor function, as it ranges over the values of binary quartic forms that are reducible over the rationals. 
0808.02341	A Moving Bump in a Continuous Manifold: A Comprehensive Study of the Tracking Dynamics of Continuous Attractor Neural Networks	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:C. C. Alan Fung, K. Y. Michael Wong, Si Wu	Abstract:  Understanding how the dynamics of a neural network is shaped by the network structure, and consequently how the network structure facilitates the functions implemented by the neural system, is at the core of using mathematical models to elucidate brain functions. This study investigates the tracking dynamics of continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs). Due to the translational invariance of neuronal recurrent interactions, CANNs can hold a continuous family of stationary states. They form a continuous manifold in which the neural system is neutrally stable. We systematically explore how this property facilitates the tracking performance of a CANN, which is believed to have clear correspondence with brain functions. By using the wave functions of the quantum harmonic oscillator as the basis, we demonstrate how the dynamics of a CANN is decomposed into different motion modes, corresponding to distortions in the amplitude, position, width or skewness of the network state. We then develop a perturbative approach that utilizes the dominating movement of the network's stationary states in the state space. This method allows us to approximate the network dynamics up to an arbitrary accuracy depending on the order of perturbation used. We quantify the distortions of a Gaussian bump during tracking, and study their effects on the tracking performance. Results are obtained on the maximum speed for a moving stimulus to be trackable and the reaction time for the network to catch up with an abrupt change in the stimulus. 
0808.02342	The evolution of the phase space density of particle beams in external fields	Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)	Authors:E.G.Bessonov	Abstract:  The evolution of the phase space density of particle beams in external fields is found proceeding from the continuity equation in the six-dimensional (6D) phase space (mu-space). The Robinson theorem, which includes the Liouville theorem as a special case, was proved in a more simple and consistent alternative way valid for arbitrary external fields, averaged fields of the beam (self-generated electro-magnetic fields except intrabeam scattering) and arbitrary frictional forces (linear, nonlinear). It includes particle accelerators as a special case. The limits of the applicability of the Robinson theorem in case of cooling of excited ions having a finite living time are presented. 
0808.02343	A Rejoinder to Mackintosh and some Remarks on the Concept of General Intelligence	Applications (stat.AP)	Authors:Moritz Heene	Abstract:  In 2000 Nicholas J. Mackintosh (2000) published an article in "Nature" referring to the concept of general intelligence ("g") claiming that there is clear empirical evidence for the existence of the g factor and psychologists are "united in their support of g". Surprisingly, his view remained yet unchallenged although this issue is by no means as clear-cut as Mackintosh argues. Let us therefore attempt to clarify some common but unfortunately major misconceptions about g, which Mackintosh, following Jensen's (1998) precedent, recounted in his "Nature" article. The bottom line is that Spearman's g does not exist, that this has been known and acknowledged by leading scholars (Guttman, 1992; Thurstone, 1947) of factor analysis for decades so that the task of objectively defining human intelligence remains unfinished. 
0808.02344	The I^G J^{PC}=0^+ 1^{-+} Tetraquark State	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Hua-Xing Chen, Atsushi Hosaka, Shi-Lin Zhu	Abstract:  We study the tetraquark state with I^G J^{PC} = 0^+ 1^{-+} in the QCD sum rule. We exhaust all possible flavor structures by using a diquark-antidiquark construction and find that the flavor structure 3*6+6*3 is preferred. There are altogether four independent currents which have the quark contents q s \bar q \bar s. By using both the Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (SVZ) sum rule and the finite energy sum rule, these currents lead to mass estimates around 1.8 - 2.1 GeV, where the uncertainty is due to the mixing of two single currents. Its possible decay modes are S-wave b_1(1235) ηand b_1(1235) η^\prime, and P-wave KK, ηη, ηη^\prime and η^\prime η^\prime, etc. The decay width is around 150 MeV through a rough estimation. 
0808.02345	Diffusion in confined geometries	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:P. Sekhar Burada, Peter Hanggi, Fabio Marchesoni, Gerhard Schmid, Peter Talkner	Abstract:  Diffusive transport of particles or, more generally, small objects is a ubiquitous feature of physical and chemical reaction systems. In configurations containing confining walls or constrictions transport is controlled both by the fluctuation statistics of the jittering objects and the phase space available to their dynamics. Consequently, the study of transport at the macro- and nanoscales must address both Brownian motion and entropic effects. With this survey we report on recent advances in the theoretical and numerical investigation of stochastic transport occurring either in micro-sized geometries of varying cross section or in narrow channels wherein the diffusing particles are hindered from passing each other (single file diffusion). For particles undergoing biased diffusion in static suspension media enclosed by confining geometries, transport exhibits intriguing features such as (i) a decrease of nonlinear mobility with increasing temperature or, also, (ii) a broad excess peak of the effective diffusion above the free diffusion limit. These paradoxical aspects can be understood in terms of entropic contributions resulting from the restricted dynamics in phase space. If, in addition, the suspension medium is subjected to external, time-dependent forcing, rectification or segregation of the diffusing Brownian particles becomes possible. Likewise, the diffusion in very narrow, spatially modulated channels gets modified via contact particle-particle interactions, which induce anomalous sub-diffusion. The effective sub-diffusion constant for a driven single file also develops a resonance-like structure as a function of the confining coupling constant. 
0808.02346	The dynamics of internal working surfaces in MHD jets	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Fabio De Colle, Alejandro Raga, Alejandro Esquivel	Abstract:  The dynamical effects of magnetic fields in models of radiative, Herbig-Haro (HH) jets have been studied in a number of papers. For example, magnetized, radiative jets from variable sources have been studied with axisymmetric and 3D numerical simulations. In this paper, we present an analytic model describing the effect of a toroidal magnetic field on the internal working surfaces that result from a variability in the ejection velocity. We find that for parameters appropriate for HH jets the forces associated with the magnetic field dominate over the gas pressure force within the working surfaces. Depending on the ram pressure radial cross section of the jet, the magnetic field can produce a strong axial pinch, or, alternatively, a broadening of the internal working surfaces. We check the validity of the analytic model with axisymmetric numerical simulations of variable, magnetized jets. 
0808.02347	Rotating Black Branes in Brans-Dicke-Born-Infeld Theory	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:S. H. Hendi	Abstract:  In this paper, we present a new class of charged rotating black brane solutions in the higher dimensional Brans-Dicke-Born-Infeld theory and investigate their properties. Solving the field equations directly is a non-trivial task because they include the second derivatives of the scalar field. We remove this difficulty through a conformal transformation. Also, we find that the suitable Lagrangian of Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton gravity is not the same as presented in \cite{DHSR}. We show that the given solutions can present black brane, with inner and outer event horizons, an extreme black brane or a naked singularity provided the parameters of the solutions are chosen suitably. These black brane solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor (anti)-de Sitter. Then we calculate finite Euclidean action, the conserved and thermodynamic quantities through the use of counterterm method. Finally, we argue that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics, and the entropy does not follow the area law. 
0808.02348	Spin Bath Decoherence Mediated by Phonons	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:O. Bozat, Z. Gedik	Abstract:  We introduce an exactly solvable model to study decoherence of a central spin interacting with a spin bath where the coupling is mediated by phonons which we assume to be in a coherent state or thermal distribution. For the coherent state case, we find that the decoherence factor decays in a Gaussian fashion and it becomes independent of the phonon frequencies at short times. If the phonon energies are much larger than spin-phonon coupling or bath spins are fully polarized, decoherence time becomes independent of the initial phonon state. For the thermal state case, phonons play more important role in decoherence with increasing temperature. We also discuss possible effects of the temperature on spin bath contribution to decoherence. 
0808.02349	A spline interpretation of Eulerian numbers	Numerical Analysis (math.NA)	Authors:Renhong Wang, Yan Xu, Zhiqiang Xu	Abstract:  In this paper, we explore the interrelationship between Eulerian numbers and B splines. Specifically, using B splines, we give the explicit formulas of the refined Eulerian numbers, and descents polynomials. Moreover, we prove that the coefficients of descent polynomials $D_d^n(t)$ are log-concave. This paper also provides a new approach to study Eulerian numbers and descent polynomials. 
0808.02350	Dynamically Generated Double Occupancy as a Probe of Cold Atom Systems	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:S.D. Huber, A. Rüegg	Abstract:  The experimental investigation of quantum phases in optical lattice systems provides major challenges. Recently, dynamical generation of double occupancy via modulation of the hopping amplitude t has been used to characterize the strongly correlated phase of fermionic atoms. Here, we want to validate this experimental technique with a theoretical study of the driven Hubbard model using analytic methods. We find that conclusive evidence for a Mott phase can be inferred from such a measurement, provided that sufficiently low temperatures kT<<t can be reached. 
0808.02351	Ricci flow, quantum mechanics and gravity	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:J.M. Isidro, J.L.G. Santander, P. Fernandez de Cordoba	Abstract:  It has been argued that, underlying any given quantum-mechanical model, there exists at least one deterministic system that reproduces, after prequantisation, the given quantum dynamics. For a quantum mechanics with a complex d-dimensional Hilbert space, the Lie group SU(d) represents classical canonical transformations on the projective space CP^{d-1} of quantum states. Let R stand for the Ricci flow of the manifold SU(d-1) down to one point, and let P denote the projection from the Hopf bundle onto its base CP^{d-1}. Then the underlying deterministic model we propose here is the Lie group SU(d), acted on by the operation PR. Finally we comment on some possible consequences that our model may have on a quantum theory of gravity. 
0808.02352	Cluster-tilted algebras and their intermediate coverings	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Bin Zhu	Abstract:  We construct the intermediate coverings of cluster-tilted algebras by defining the generalized cluster categories. These generalized cluster categories are Calabi-Yau triangulated categories with fraction CY-dimension and have also cluster tilting objects (subcategories). Furthermore we study the representations of these intermediate coverings of cluster-tilted algebras. 
0808.02353	Spin squeezing of a cold atomic ensemble with the nuclear spin of one-half	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:T. Takano, M. Fuyama, R. Namiki, Y. Takahashi	Abstract:  To establish an applicable system for advanced quantum information processing between light and atoms, we have demonstrated the quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement with a collective spin of cold ytterbium atoms (171Yb), and observed 1.8 (-1.5, +2.4) dB spin squeezing. Since a 171Yb atom has only a nuclear spin of 1/2 in the ground state, the system is the simplest spin ensemble and robust against decoherence. We used very short pulses with the width of 100 ns, so the interaction time became much shorter than the decoherence time, which is important for multi-step quantum information processing. 
0808.02354	Viscosity Bound, Causality Violation and Instability with Stringy Correction and Charge	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Xian-Hui Ge, Yoshinori Matsuo, Fu-Wen Shu, Sang-Jin Sin, Takuya Tsukioka	Abstract:  Recently, it has been shown that if we consider the higher derivative correction, the viscosity bound conjectured to be $η/s=1/4π$ is violated and so is the causality. In this paper, we consider medium effect and the higher derivative correction simultaneously by adding charge and Gauss-Bonnet terms. We find that the viscosity bound violation is not changed by the charge. However, we find that two effects together create another instability for large momentum regime. We argue the presence of tachyonic modes and show it numerically. The stability of the black brane requires the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $λ$($=2α'/l^2$) to be smaller than 1/24. We draw a phase diagram relevant to the instability in charge-coupling space. 
0808.02355	Processes in Resonant Domains of Metal Nanoparticle Aggregates and Optical Nonlinearity of Aggregates in Pulsed Laser Fields	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Anatoliy P. Gavrilyuk, Sergei V. Karpov	Abstract:  The specific optical nonlinearities inherent in aggregates of metal nanoparticles under pico- and nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation are studied in nanoparticle aggregates formed in silver hydrosols. The results of experimental studies of the correlation between the degree of aggregation of silver hydrosols and their nonlinear refraction index at the wavelengths 0.532 and 1.064 microns are discussed. The experiments revealed that nonlinear refraction index changes its sign at 1.064 microns as the degree of the hydrosol aggregation grows. The role of various processes occurring in resonant domains of aggregates and the kinetics of these processes under laser irradiation resulting in dynamic variation of the polarizability of aggregates are analyzed. The areas under study included the kinetics of particles displacement considering dissipative forces, heating of the particles and of the surrounding medium depending on the wavelength, intensity and duration of laser pulses. A theory of interaction of laser radiation with an elementary type domain - two bound silver nanoparticles - was developed to describe the kinetics of resonant domains photomodification in aggregates. This theory takes into account thermal, elastic, electrostatic and light induced effects. The experimental results on laser photomodification of silver particle aggregates are discussed in the context of our model. These results include photochromic and nonlinear optical effects, in particular, the nonlinear refraction and nonlinear absorption. 
0808.02356	A Ni-based Superconductor: the Heusler Compound ZrNi$_2$Ga	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Juergen Winterlik, Gerhard H.Fecher, Claudia Felser*, Martin Jourdan, Kai Grube, Frederic Hardy, Hilbert von Loehneysen, K. L. Holman, R. J. Cava	Abstract:  This work reports on the novel Heusler superconductor ZrNi2Ga. Compared to other nickel-based superconductors with Heusler structure, ZrNi2Ga exhibits a relatively high superconducting transition temperature of Tc=2.9 K and an upper critical field of 1.5 T. Electronic structure calculations show that this relatively high transition temperature is caused by a van Hove singularity, which leads to an enhanced density of states at the Fermi energy. The van Hove singularity originates from a higher order valence instability at the L-point in the electronic structure. The enhanced density of states at the Fermi level was confirmed by specific heat and susceptibility measurements. Although many Heusler compounds are ferromagnetic, our measurements of ZrNi2Ga indicate a paramagnetic state above Tc and could not reveal any traces of magnetic order down to temperatures of at least 0.35 K. We investigated in detail the superconducting state with specific heat, magnetization, and resistivity measurements. The resulting data show the typical behavior of a conventional, weakly coupled BCS (s-wave) superconductor. 
0808.02357	Single crystal growth and characterizations of Cu0.03TaS2 superconductors	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:X. D. Zhu, Y. P. Sun, X. B. Zhu, X. Luo, B. S. Wang, G. Li, Z. R. Yang, W. H. Song, J. M. Dai	Abstract:  Single crystal of Cu0.03TaS2 with low copper intercalated content was successfully grown via chemical iodine-vapor transport. The structural characterization results show that the copper intercalated 2H-Cu0.03TaS2 single crystal has the same structure of the CdI2-type structure as the parent 2H-TaS2 crystal. Electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements reveal that 2H-Cu0.03TaS2 becomes a superconductor below 4.2 K. Besides, electrical resistivity and Hall effects results show that a charge density wave transition occurs at TCDW = 50 K. 
0808.02358	Canted Magnetization Texture in Ferromagnetic Tunnel Junctions	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Igor Kuzmenko, Vladimir Fal'ko	Abstract:  We study the formation of inhomogeneous magnetization texture in the vicinity of a tunnel junction between two ferromagnetic wires nominally in the antiparallel configuration and its influence on the magnetoresistance of such a device. The texture, dependent on magnetization rigidity and crystalline anisotropy energy in the ferromagnet, appears upon an increase of ferromagnetic inter-wire coupling above a critical value and it varies with an external magnetic field. 
0808.02359	Integral and Rxte/Asm Observations on Igr J17098-3628	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yu-Peng Chen, Shu Zhang, Nick Schurch, Jian-Min Wang, Werner Collmar, Ti-Pei Li, Jin-Lu Qu, Cheng-Min Zhang	Abstract:  To probe further the possible nature of the unidentified source IGR J17098-3628, we have carried out a detailed analysis of its long-term time variability as monitored by RXTE/ASM, and of its hard X-ray properties as observed by INTEGRAL. INTEGRAL has monitored this sky region over years and significantly detected IGR J17098-3628 only when the source was in this dubbed active state. In particular, at $\ge$ 20 keV, IBIS/ISGRI caught an outburst in March 2005, lasting for $\sim$5 days with detection significance of 73$σ$ (20-40 keV) and with the emission at $< $200 keV. The ASM observations reveal that the soft X-ray lightcurve shows a similar outburst to that detected by INTEGRAL, however the peak of the soft X-ray lightcurve either lags, or is preceded by, the hard X-ray ($>$20 keV) outburst by $\sim$2 days. This resembles the behavior of X-ray novae like XN 1124-683, hence it further suggests a LMXB nature for IGR J17098-3628. While the quality of the ASM data prevents us from drawing any definite conclusions, these discoveries are important clues that, coupled with future observations, will help to resolve the as yet unknown nature of IGR J17098-3628. 
0808.02360	Hawking Fluxes, $W_\infty$ Algebra and Anomalies	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:L.Bonora, M.Cvitan, S.Pallua, I.Smolic	Abstract:  We complete the analysis started in [arXiv:0804.0198] of the Hawking radiation calculated by means of anomaly techniques. We concentrate on a static radially symmetric BH, reduced to two dimensions. We compare the two methods used to derive the integrated Hawking radiation, based on the trace and diffeomorphism anomaly, respectively, and show that they can be reduced to the same basic elements. We then concentrate on higher moments of the Hawking radiation and on higher spin currents, and show that, similarly to trace anomalies, also diffeomorphism anomalies are absent from the conservation laws of higher spin currents. We show that the predictivity of the method is due to the $W_\infty$ current algebra underlying the effective model that describes matter around the black hole. 
0808.02361	Gradient theory for plasticity via homogenization of discrete dislocations	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Adriana Garroni, Giovanni Leoni, Marcello Ponsiglione	Abstract:  In this paper, we deduce a macroscopic strain gradient theory for plasticity from a model of discrete dislocations. We restrict our analysis to the case of a cylindrical symmetry for the crystal in exam, so that the mathematical formulation will involve a two dimensional variational problem. The dislocations are introduced as point topological defects of the strain fields, for which we compute the elastic energy stored outside the so called core region. We show that the Gamma-limit as the core radius tends to zero and the number of dislocations tends to infinity of this energy (suitably rescaled), takes the form $$ E= \int_{\Om} (W(β^e) + \f (\Curl β^e)) dx, $$ where $β^e$ represents the elastic part of the macroscopic strain, and $\Curl β^e$ represents the geometrically necessary dislocation density. The plastic energy density $\f$ is defined explicitly through an asymptotic cell formula, depending only on the elastic tensor and the class of the admissible Burgers vectors, accounting for the crystalline structure. It turns out to be positively 1-homogeneous, so that concentration on lines is permitted, accounting for the presence of pattern formations observed in crystals such as dislocation walls. 
0808.02362	Something about Z-penguins I want to tell	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Ulrich Haisch	Abstract:  We stress that in models with constrained minimal flavor violation large negative corrections to the flavor-changing Z-penguin amplitudes are excluded by the precision measurements of the Z -> b anti-b pseudo observables performed at LEP and SLC. The derived stringent range for the non-standard contribution to the universal Inami-Lim function C leads to tight two-sided limits for the branching ratios of all Z-penguin dominated flavor-changing K- and B-decays. 
0808.02363	Complete minimal surfaces in R3 with a prescribed coordinate function	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Antonio Alarcon, Isabel Fernandez	Abstract:  In this paper we construct complete simply connected minimal surfaces with a prescribed coordinate function. Moreover, we prove that these surfaces are dense in the space of all minimal surfaces with this coordinate function (with the topology of the smooth convergence on compact sets). 
0808.02364	First order Mott transition at zero temperature in two dimensions: Variational plaquette study	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Matthias Balzer, Bumsoo Kyung, David Sénéchal, A.-M. S. Tremblay, Michael Potthoff	Abstract:  The nature of the metal-insulator Mott transition at zero temperature has been discussed for a number of years. Whether it occurs through a quantum critical point or through a first order transition is expected to profoundly influence the nature of the finite temperature phase diagram. In this paper, we study the zero temperature Mott transition in the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice with the variational cluster approximation. This takes into account the influence of antiferromagnetic short-range correlations. By contrast to single-site dynamical mean-field theory, the transition turns out to be first order even at zero temperature. 
0808.02365	Reexamining Black-Body Shifts for Hydrogenlike Ions	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:U. D. Jentschura, M. Haas	Abstract:  We investigate black-body induced energy shifts for low-lying levels of atomic systems, with a special emphasis on transitions used in current and planned high-precision experiments on atomic hydrogen and ionized helium. Fine-structure and Lamb-shift induced black-body shifts are found to increase with the square of the nuclear charge number, whereas black-body shifts due to virtual transitions decrease with increasing nuclear charge as the fourth power of the nuclear charge. We also investigate the decay width acquired by the ground state of atomic hydrogen, due to interaction with black-body photons. The corresponding width is due to an instability against excitation to higher excited atomic levels, and due to black-body induced ionization. These effects limit the lifetime of even the most fundamental, a priori absolutely stable, "asymptotic" state of atomic theory, namely the ground state of atomic hydrogen. 
0808.02366	A variational model for quasistatic crack growth in nonlinear elasticity: some qualitative properties of the solutions	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Gianni Dal Maso, Alessandro Giacomini, Marcello Ponsiglione	Abstract:  We present the main existence result for quasistatic crack growth in the model proposed by Dal Maso, Francfort, and Toader, and prove some qualitative properties of the solutions. 
0808.02367	Extreme multiplex spectroscopy at wide-field 4-m telescopes	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Robert Content, Tom Shanks	Abstract:  We describe the design and science case for a spectrograph for the prime focus of classical 4-m wide-field telescopes that can deliver at least 4000 MOS slits over a 1 degree field. This extreme multiplex capability means that 25000 galaxy redshifts can be measured in a single night, opening up the possibilities for large galaxy redshift surveys out to z~0.7 and beyond for the purpose of measuring the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale and for many other science goals. The design features four cloned spectrographs and exploits the exclusive possibility of tiling the focal plane of wide-field 4-m telescopes with CCDs for multi-object spectroscopic purposes. In ~200 night projects, such spectrographs have the potential to make galaxy redshift surveys of ~6 million galaxies over a wide redshift range and thus may provide a low-cost alternative to other survey routes such as WFMOS and SKA. Two of these extreme multiplex spectrographs are currently being designed for the AAT (NG1dF) and Calar Alto (XMS) 4-m class telescopes. NG2dF, a larger version for the AAT 2 degree field, would have 12 clones and at least 12000 slits. The clones use a transparent design including a grism in which all optics are smaller than the clone square subfield so that the clones can be tightly packed with little gaps between the contiguous fields. Only low cost glasses are used; the variations in chromatic aberrations between bands are compensated by changing one or two of the lenses adjacent to the grism. The total weight and length is smaller with a few clones than a unique spectrograph which makes it feasible to place the spectrograph at the prime focus. 
0808.02368	Strong Spectral Gaps for Compact Quotients of Products of $\PSL(2,\bbR)$	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Dubi Kelmer, Peter Sarnak	Abstract:  The existence of a strong spectral gap for quotients $Γ\bs G$ of noncompact connected semisimple Lie groups is crucial in many applications. For congruence lattices there are uniform and very good bounds for the spectral gap coming from the known bounds towards the Ramanujan-Selberg Conjectures. If $G$ has no compact factors then for general lattices a strong spectral gap can still be established, however, there is no uniformity and no effective bounds are known. This note is concerned with the strong spectral gap for an irreducible co-compact lattice $Γ$ in $G=\PSL(2,\bbR)^d$ for $d\geq 2$ which is the simplest and most basic case where the congruence subgroup property is not known. The method used here gives effective bounds for the spectral gap in this setting. 
0808.02369	Collisional energy transfer in two-component plasmas	Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)	Authors:J. Vranjes, M. Kono, S. Poedts, M. Y. Tanaka	Abstract:  The friction in plasmas consisting of two species with different temperatures is discussed together with the consequent energy transfer. It is shown that the friction between the two species has no effect on the ion acoustic mode in a quasi-neutral plasma. Using the Poisson equation instead of the quasi-neutrality reveals the possibility for an instability driven by the collisional energy transfer. However, the different starting temperatures of the two species imply an evolving equilibrium. It is shown that the relaxation time of the equilibrium electron-ion plasma is, in fact, always shorter than the growth rate time, and the instability can thus never effectively take place. The results obtained here should contribute to the definite clarification of some contradictory results obtained in the past. 
0808.02370	Driving Weiss oscillations to Zero Resistance States by Microwave Radiation	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Jesus Inarrea, Gloria Platero	Abstract:  In this work we present a theoretical model to study the effect of microwave radiation on Weiss oscillations. In our proposal Weiss oscillations, produced by an spatial periodic potential, are modulated by microwave radiation due to an interference effect between both, space and time-dependent, potentials. The final magnetoresistance depends mainly on the spatial period of the spatial potential and the frequency of radiation. Depending on the values of these parameters, we predict that Weiss oscillations can reach zero resistance states. On the other hand, these dissipationless transport states, created just by radiation, can be destroyed by the additional presence of a periodic space-dependent potential. Then by tuning the spatial period or the radiation frequency, the magnetoresistance can be strongly modified. 
0808.02371	Direct X-ray Spectral Deprojection of Galaxy Clusters	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:H. R. Russell, J. S. Sanders, A. C. Fabian (Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge)    	Abstract:  Temperature, density and abundance profiles of the hot intracluster medium (ICM) are important diagnostics of the complex interactions of gravitational and feedback processes in the cores of galaxy clusters. Deprojection of X-ray data by methods such as projct, which are model dependent, can produce large and unphysical oscillating temperature profiles. Here we validate a deprojection routine, Direct Spectral Deprojection (DSDeproj; Sanders & Fabian 2007), showing that it solves some of the issues inherent to model-dependent deprojection routines. DSDeproj is a model-independent approach, assuming only spherical symmetry, which subtracts projected spectra from each successive annulus to produce a set of deprojected spectra. 
0808.02372	Dilution effect in correlated electron system with orbital degeneracy	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Takayoshi Tanaka, Sumio Ishihara	Abstract:  Theory of dilution effect in orbital ordered system is presented. The $e_g$ orbital model without spin degree of freedom and the spin-orbital coupled model in a three-dimensional simple-cubic lattice are analyzed by the Monte-Carlo simulation and the cluster expansion method. In the $e_g$ orbital model without spin degree of freedom, reduction of the orbital ordering temperature due to dilution is steeper than that in the dilute magnet. This is attributed to a modification of the orbital wave-function around vacant sites. In the spin-orbital coupled model, it is found that magnetic structure is changed from the A-type antiferromagnetic order into the ferromagnetic one. Orbital dependent exchange interaction and a sign change of this interaction around vacant sites bring about this novel phenomena. Present results explain the recent experiments in transition-metal compounds with orbital dilution. 
0808.02373	Tests of multimode quantum non-locality with homodyne measurements	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Antonio Acín, Nicolas J. Cerf, Alessandro Ferraro, Julien Niset	Abstract:  We investigate the violation of local realism in Bell tests involving homodyne measurements performed on multimode continuous-variable states. By binning the measurement outcomes in an appropriate way, we prove that the Mermin-Klyshko inequality can be violated by an amount that grows exponentially with the number of modes. Furthermore, the maximum violation allowed by quantum mechanics can be attained for any number of modes, albeit requiring a quantum state that is rather unrealistic. Interestingly, this exponential increase of the violation holds true even for simpler states, such as multipartite GHZ states. The resulting benefit of using more modes is shown to be significant in practical multipartite Bell tests by analyzing the increase of the robustness to noise with the number of modes. In view of the high efficiency achievable with homodyne detection, our results thus open a possible way to feasible loophole-free Bell tests that are robust to experimental imperfections. We provide an explicit example of a three-mode state (a superposition of coherent states) which results in a significantly high violation of the Mermin-Klyshko inequality (around 10%) with homodyne measurements. 
0808.02374	Gluonic Pole Matrix Elements in Spectator Models	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:A.Mukherjee, L. Gamberg, P. J. Mulders	Abstract:  We investigate the gluonic pole matrix element contributing to the first $p_T$ moment of the distribution and fragmentation functions in a spectator model. By performing a spectral analysis, we find that for a large class of spectator models, the contribution of gluonic pole matrix elements is non-zero for the distribution correlators, whereas in fragmentation correlators they vanish. This outcome is important in the study of universality for fragmentation functions. 
0808.02375	Molecular Emission Line Formation in Prestellar Cores	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ya. Pavlyuchenkov, D. Wiebe, B. Shustov, Th. Henning, R. Launhardt, D. Semenov	Abstract:  We investigate general aspects of molecular line formation under conditions which are typical of prestellar cores. Focusing on simple linear molecules, we study formation of their rotational lines by radiative transfer simulations. We present a thermalization diagram to show the effects of collisions and radiation on the level excitation. We construct a detailed scheme (contribution chart) to illustrate the formation of emission line profiles. This chart can be used as an efficient tool to identify which parts of the cloud contribute to a specific line profile. We show how molecular line characteristics for uniform model clouds depend on hydrogen density, molecular column density, and kinetic temperature. The results are presented in a 2D plane to illustrate cooperative effects of the physical factors. We also use a core model with a non-uniform density distribution and chemical stratification to study the effects of cloud contraction and rotation on spectral line maps. We discuss the main issues that should be taken into account when dealing with interpretation and simulation of observed molecular lines. 
0808.02376	Liouville Theory and Elliptic Genera	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Anne Taormina	Abstract:  The structure and modular properties of N=4 superconformal characters are reviewed and exploited, in an attempt to construct elliptic genera-like functions by decompactifying K3. The construction is tested against expressions obtained in the context of strings propagating in background ALE spaces of type A(n-1), using the underlying superconformal theory, i.e the tensor product of N=2 minimal with N=2 Liouville theory. 
0808.02377	The precursor state to superconductivity in CeIrIn${_5}$: Unusual scaling of magnetotransport	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Sunil Nair, M. Nicklas, F. Steglich, J.L. Sarrao, J.D. Thompson, A.J. Schofield, S. Wirth	Abstract:  We present an analysis of the normal-state Hall effect and magnetoresistance in the heavy fermion superconductor CeIrIn${_5}$. It is demonstrated that the modified Kohler's scaling--which relates the magnetoresistance to the Hall angle--breaks down prior to the onset of superconductivity due to the presence of a precursor state to superconductivity in this system. A model-independent, single-parameter scaling of the Hall angle governed solely by this precursor state is observed. Neither the Hall coefficient nor the resistivity exhibit this scaling implying that this precursor state preferentially influences the Hall channel. 
0808.02378	Synchrotron radiation from a charge moving along a helix around a dielectric cylinder	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:A. A. Saharian, A. S. Kotanjyan	Abstract:  In this paper we investigate the radiation emitted by a charged particle moving along a helical orbit around a dielectric cylinder immersed into a homogeneous medium. Formulae are derived for the electromagnetic potentials, electric and magnetic fields, and for the spectral-angular distribution of the radiation in the exterior medium. It is shown that under the Cherenkov condition for dielectric permittivity of the cylinder and the velocity of the particle image on the cylinder surface, strong narrow peaks appear in the angular distribution for the number of quanta radiated on a given harmonic. At these peaks the radiated energy exceeds the corresponding quantity for a homogeneous medium by several dozens of times. Simple analytic estimates are given for the heights and widths of these peaks. The results of numerical calculations for the angular distribution of the radiated quanta are presented and they are compared with the corresponding quantities for the radiation from a charge moving along a helical trajectory inside a dielectric cylinder. 
0808.02379	Emergent Universe and Phantom Tachyon Model	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Ujjal Debnath	Abstract:  In this work, I have considered that the universe is filled with normal matter and phantom field (or tachyonic field). If the universe is filled with scalar field, Ellis et al have shown that emergent scenario is possible only for $k=+1$ i.e. for closed universe and here I have shown that the emergent scenario is possible for closed universe if the universe contains normal tachyonic field. But for phantom field (or tachyonic field), the negative kinetic term can generate the emergent scenario for all values of $k ~(=0,\pm 1)$. From recently developed statefinder parameters, the behaviour of different stages of the evolution of the emergent universe have been studied. The static Einstein universe and the stability analysis have been briefly discussed for both phantom and tachyon models. 
0808.02380	Hamiltonian statistical mechanics	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Dorje C. Brody, David C.P. Ellis, Darryl D. Holm	Abstract:  A framework for statistical-mechanical analysis of quantum Hamiltonians is introduced. The approach is based upon a gradient flow equation in the space of Hamiltonians such that the eigenvectors of the initial Hamiltonian evolve toward those of the reference Hamiltonian. The nonlinear double-bracket equation governing the flow is such that the eigenvalues of the initial Hamiltonian remain unperturbed. The space of Hamiltonians is foliated by compact invariant subspaces, which permits the construction of statistical distributions over the Hamiltonians. In two dimensions, an explicit dynamical model is introduced, wherein the density function on the space of Hamiltonians approaches an equilibrium state characterised by the canonical ensemble. This is used to compute quenched and annealed averages of quantum observables. 
0808.02381	On finite-index extensions of subgroups of free groups	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Pedro Silva (CMUP), Pascal Weil (LaBRI)    	Abstract:  We study the lattice of finite-index extensions of a given finitely generated subgroup $H$ of a free group $F$. This lattice is finite and we give a combinatorial characterization of its greatest element, which is the commensurator of $H$. This characterization leads to a fast algorithm to compute the commensurator, which is based on a standard algorithm from automata theory. We also give a sub-exponential and super-polynomial upper bound for the number of finite-index extensions of $H$, and we give a language-theoretic characterization of the lattice of finite-index subgroups of $H$. Finally, we give a polynomial time algorithm to compute the malnormal closure of $H$. 
0808.02382	Mixing of Quantum Walks on Generalized Hypercubes	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Ana Best, Markus Kliegl, Shawn Mead-Gluchacki, Christino Tamon	Abstract:  We study continuous-time quantum walks on graphs which generalize the hypercube. The only known family of graphs whose quantum walk instantaneously mixes to uniform is the Hamming graphs with small arities. We show that quantum uniform mixing on the hypercube is robust under the addition of perfect matchings but not much else. Our specific results include: (1) The graph obtained by augmenting the hypercube with an additive matching is instantaneous uniform mixing whenever the parity of the matching is even, but with a slower mixing time. This strictly includes Moore-Russell's result on the hypercube. (2) The class of Hamming graphs is not uniform mixing if and only if its arity is greater than 5. This is a tight characterization of quantum uniform mixing on Hamming graphs; previously, only the status of arity less than 5 was known. (3) The bunkbed graph B(A[f]), defined by a hypercube-circulant matrix A and a Boolean function f, is not uniform mixing if the Fourier transform of f has small support. This explains why the hypercube is uniform mixing and why the join of two hypercubes is not. 
0808.02383	How to Draw Tropical Planes	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Sven Herrmann, Anders Jensen, Michael Joswig, Bernd Sturmfels	Abstract:  The tropical Grassmannian parameterizes tropicalizations of linear spaces, while the Dressian parameterizes all planes in $\TP^{n-1}$. We study these parameter spaces and we compute them explicitly for $n \leq 7$. Planes are identified with matroid subdivisions and with arrangements of trees. These representations are used to draw pictures. 
0808.02384	Sound waves in the intracluster medium of the Centaurus cluster	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J.S Sanders, A.C. Fabian (Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge)    	Abstract:  We report the discovery of ripple-like X-ray surface brightness oscillations in the core of the Centaurus cluster of galaxies, found with 200 ks of Chandra observations. The features are between 3 to 5 per cent variations in surface brightness with a wavelength of around 9 kpc. If, as has been conjectured for the Perseus cluster, these are sound waves generated by the repetitive inflation of central radio bubbles, they represent around 5x10^42 erg/s of spherical sound-wave power at a radius of 30 kpc. The period of the waves would be 10^7 yr. If their power is dissipated in the core of the cluster, it would balance much of the radiative cooling by X-ray emission, which is around 1.3x10^43 erg/s within the inner 30 kpc. The power of the sound waves would be a factor of four smaller that the heating power of the central radio bubbles, which means that energy is converted into sound waves efficiently. 
0808.02385	On the nature of unabsorbed Seyfert 2 galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Murray Brightman, Kirpal Nandra	Abstract:  We present an analysis of six 12 um selected Seyfert 2 galaxies that have been reported to be unabsorbed in the X-ray. By comparing the luminosities of these galaxies in the mid-IR (12um), optical ([O III]) and hard X-ray (2-10 keV), we show that they are all under-luminous in the 2-10 keV X-ray band. Four of the objects exhibit X-ray spectra indicative of a hard excess, consistent with a heavily obscured X-ray component and hence a hidden nucleus. In these objects the softer X-rays may be dominated by a strong soft scattered continuum or contamination from the host galaxy, which is responsible for the unabsorbed X-ray spectra observed, and accounts for the anomalously low 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity. We confirm this assertion in NGC4501 with a Chandra observation, which shows hard X-ray emission coincident with the nucleus, consistent with heavy absorption, and a number of contaminating softer sources which account for the bulk of the softer emission. We point out that such 'Compton thick' sources need not necessarily present iron Ka emission of high EW. An example in our sample is IRASF01475-0740, which we know must host an obscured AGN as it hosts a HBLR seen in scattered light (Tran 2003). The X-ray spectrum is nonetheless relatively unobscured and the iron Ka line only moderate in strength. These observations can be reconciled if the hidden nuclear emission is dominated by transmitted, rather than reflected X-rays, which can then be weak compared to the soft scattered light or galactic emission. Despite these considerations, we conclude that NGC3147 & 3660 may intrinsically lack a BLR, confirming the recent results of Bianchi et al. (2008) for NGC3147. Neither X-ray spectrum shows signs of hidden hard emission and both sources exhibit X-ray variability leading us to believe we are viewing the nucleus directly. 
0808.02386	TW Hydrae: evidence of stellar spots instead of a Hot Jupiter	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:N. Huelamo, P. Figueira, X. Bonfils, N.C. Santos, F. Pepe, M. Guillon, R. Azevedo, T. Barman, M. Fernandez, E. di Folco, E.W. Guenther, C. Lovis, C.H.F. Melo, D. Queloz, S. Udry	Abstract:  TW Hydrae shows significant radial-velocity variations in the optical regime. They have been attributed to a 10 Jupiter Mass planet orbiting the star at 0.04 AU. In this work, we have tested whether the observed RV variations can be caused by stellar spots. We have also analyzed new optical and infrared data to confirm the signal of the planet companion. We fitted the RV variations of TW Hya using a cool spot model. Our model shows that a cold spot covering 7% of the stellar surface and located at a latitude of 54 deg can reproduce the reported RV variations. The model also predicts a bisector semi-amplitude variation <10 m/s, which is less than the errors of the RV measurements discussed in an earlier publication. The analysis of new optical RV data, with typical errors of 10 m/s, shows a larger RV amplitude that varies depending on the correlation mask used. A slight correlation between the RV variation and the bisector is also observed, although not at a very significant level. The infrared H-band RV curve is almost flat, showing a small variation (<35 m/s) that is not consistent with the optical orbit. All these results support the spot scenario rather than the presence of a hot Jupiter around TW Hya. 
0808.02387	Simulations of a supersymmetry inspired model on a fuzzy sphere	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Wolfgang Bietenholz	Abstract:  We present a numerical study of a two dimensional model of the Wess-Zumino type. We formulate this model on a sphere, where the fields are expanded in spherical harmonics. The sphere becomes fuzzy by a truncation in the angular momenta. This leads to a finite set of degrees of freedom without explicitly breaking the space symmetries. The corresponding field theory is expressed in terms of a matrix model, which can be simulated. We present first numerical results for the phase structure of a variant of this model on a fuzzy sphere. The prospect to restore exact supersymmetry in certain limits is under investigation. 
0808.02388	Signatures of Universal Characteristics of Fractal Fluctuations in Global Mean Monthly Temperature Anomalies	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:A.M.Selvam	Abstract:  Selfsimilar space-time fractal fluctuations are generic to dynamical systems in nature such as atmospheric flows, heartbeat patterns, population dynamics, etc. The physics of the long-range correlations intrinsic to fractal fluctuations is not yet identified. It is important to quantify the physics underlying the irregular fractal fluctuations for predictability studies. A general systems theory for fractals visualizes the emergence of successively larger scale fluctuations to result from the space-time integration of enclosed smaller scale fluctuations. The model predictions are as follows. The probability distribution and the power spectrum for fractal fluctuations is the same inverse power law function incorporating the golden mean. The predicted distribution is close to the Gaussian distribution for small-scale fluctuations but exhibits fat long tail for large-scale fluctuations with higher probability of occurrence than predicted by Gaussian distribution. Since the power (variance i.e. square of eddy amplitude) spectrum also represents the probability densities as in the case of quantum systems such as the electron or photon, fractal fluctuations exhibit quantumlike chaos. The fine structure constant for spectrum of fractal fluctuations is a function of the golden mean and is analogous to atomic spectra equal to about 1/137. Global gridded time series data sets of monthly mean temperatures for the period 1880 - 2007/2008 are analysed to show that data sets and corresponding power spectra exhibit distributions close to the model predicted inverse power law distribution. The model predicted and observed universal spectrum for interannual variability rules out linear secular trends in global monthly mean temperatures. Global warming results in intensification of fluctuations of all scales and manifested immediately in high frequency fluctuations. 
0808.02389	The GSI anomaly	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Hendrik Kienert, Joachim Kopp, Manfred Lindner, Alexander Merle	Abstract:  Recently, an experiment at GSI Darmstadt has observed oscillating decay rates of heavy ions. Several controversial attempts have been made to explain this effect in terms of neutrino mixing. We briefly describe the experimental results, give an overview of the literature, and show that the effect cannot be due to neutrino mixing. If the effect survives, it could, however, be explained by hypothetical internal excitations of the mother ions (~ 10^(-15) eV). 
0808.02390	Weighted Hardy and singular operators in Morrey spaces	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Natasha Samko	Abstract:  We study the weighted boundedness of the Cauchy singular integral operator $S_\Gm$ in Morrey spaces $L^{p,λ}(\Gm)$ on curves satisfying the arc-chord condition, for a class of "radial type" almost monotonic weights. The non-weighted boundedness is shown to hold on an arbitrary Carleson curve. We show that the weighted boundedness is reduced to the boundedness of weighted Hardy operators in Morrey spaces $L^{p,λ}(0,\ell), \ell>0$. We find conditions for weighted Hardy operators to be bounded in Morrey spaces. To cover the case of curves we also extend the boundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator in Morrey spaces, known in the Euclidean setting, to the case of Carleson curves. Key words and phrases: Morrey space, singular operator, Hardy operator, Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator, weighted estimate. 
0808.02391	Star formation rates in Lyman break galaxies: radio stacking of LBGs in the COSMOS field and the sub-$μ$Jy radio source population	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:C.L. Carilli (NRAO), Nicholas Lee (NRAO), P. Capak (CIT), E. Schinnerer (MPIA), K.-S. Lee (Yale), H. McCraken (IAP), M.S. Yun (UMass), N. Scoville (CIT), V. Smolcic (CIT), M. Giavalisco (UMass), A. Datta (NRAO), Y. Taniguchi (Ehime Univ)C. Megan Urry (Yale)    	Abstract:  We present an analysis of the radio properties of large samples of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at $z \sim 3$, 4, and 5 from the COSMOS field. The median stacking analysis yields a statistical detection of the $z \sim 3$ LBGs (U-band drop-outs), with a 1.4 GHz flux density of $0.90 \pm 0.21 μ$Jy. The stacked emission is unresolved, with a size $< 1"$, or a physical size $< 8$kpc. The total star formation rate implied by this radio luminosity is $31\pm 7$ $M_\odot$ year$^{-1}$, based on the radio-FIR correlation in low redshift star forming galaxies. The star formation rate derived from a similar analysis of the UV luminosities is 17 $M_\odot$ year$^{-1}$, without any correction for UV dust attenuation. The simplest conclusion is that the dust attenuation factor is 1.8 at UV wavelengths. However, this factor is considerably smaller than the standard attenuation factor $\sim 5$, normally assumed for LBGs. We discuss potential reasons for this discrepancy, including the possibility that the dust attenuation factor at $z \ge 3$ is smaller than at lower redshifts. Conversely, the radio luminosity for a given star formation rate may be systematically lower at very high redshift. Two possible causes for a suppressed radio luminosity are: (i) increased inverse Compton cooling of the relativistic electron population due to scattering off the increasing CMB at high redshift, or (ii) cosmic ray diffusion from systematically smaller galaxies. The radio detections of individual sources are consistent with a radio-loud AGN fraction of 0.3%. One source is identified as a very dusty, extreme starburst galaxy (a 'submm galaxy'). 
0808.02392	Upper critical field, anisotropy, and superconducting properties of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Zhao-Sheng Wang, Hui-Qian Luo, Cong Ren, Hai-Hu Wen	Abstract:  The temperature dependent resistivity of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ (x = 0.23, 0.25, 0.28 and 0.4) single crystals and the angle dependent resistivity of superconducting Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals were measured in magnetic fields up to 9 T. The measurements of temperature dependent resistivity for samples with different doping levels revealed very high upper critical fields which increase with the transition temperature monotonously, and a very low superconducting anisotropy ratio $Γ=H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^c \approx$ 2. By scaling the resistivity in the frame of the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau theory, the angle dependent resistivity of the Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ single crystal measured with different magnetic fields at a certain temperature collapsed onto one curve. As the only scaling parameter, the anisotropy $Γ$ was determined alternatively for each temperature and was found to be between two and three. 
0808.02393	Fat-Tailed Distributions and Levy Processes	Applications (stat.AP)	Authors:Louis Mello	Abstract:  The notion that natural disasters can be controlled is, of course, farcical; history is permeated with examples of countless failed attempts at this pointless task; it is synonymous with trying to build a perpetual motion machine. Nonetheless, there are ways to reduce their impact on human communities, particularly by looking away from the normal hypothesis. 
0808.02394	Electronic Structure of Noncentrosymmetric Superconductor Li$_2$(Pd$_x$Pt$_{1-x}$3)B Studied by Photoemission Spectroscopy	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Rikiya Yoshida, Hiroyuki Okazaki, Mitsutoshi Tajima, Takayuki Muro, Izumi Hase, Kozo Okada, Hiroyuki Takeya, Kazuto Hirata, Masaaki Hirai, Yuji Muraoka, Takayoshi Yokoya	Abstract:  We have performed x-ray photoemission spectroscopy on the system of noncentrosymmetric superconductor, Li$_2$(Pd$_x$Pt$_{1-x}$3)B. For Li$_2$Pt$_3$B, we found 2 major peaks with 2 other weak components, and the band calculations were in agreement with the observation. The assignment of valence band features using the calculated partial density of states determined that Pt 5d and B 2p contribute to the density of states at the Fermi level. The effect of antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling on the band structure might have been probed, and the analysis on the effect of Pt incorporation into the system indicates the smooth evolution of electronic structures. We presented the measurements of core levels (Pd 3d, Pt 4f, and B 1s) and discussed the chemical bonding states and electronic structures from them. 
0808.02395	Rankin's method and Jacobi forms of several variables	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:B. Ramakrishnan, Brundaban Sahu	Abstract:  Following Rankin's method, D. Zagier computed the $n$-th Rankin-Cohen bracket of a modular form $g$ of weight $k_1$ with the Eisenstein series of weight $k_2$ and then computed the inner product of this Rankin-Cohen bracket with a cusp form $f$ of weight $k = k_1+k_2+2n$ and showed that this inner product gives, upto a constant, the special value of the Rankin-Selberg convolution of $f$ and $g$. This result was generalized to Jacobi forms of degree 1 by Y. Choie and W. Kohnen. In this paper, we generalize this result to Jacobi forms defined over ${\mathcal H} \times {\mathbb C}^{(g, 1)}$. 
0808.02396	Non Abelian Vortices as Instantons on Noncommutative Discrete Space	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Hitoshi Ikemori, Shinsaku Kitakado, Hideharu Otsu, Toshiro Sato	Abstract:  There seems to be close relationship between the moduli space of vortices and the moduli space of instantons, which is not yet clearly understood from a standpoint of the field theory. We clarify the reasons why many similarities are found in the methods for constructing the moduli of instanton and vortex, viewed in the light of the notion of the self-duality. We show that the non-Abelian vortex is nothing but the instanton in $R^{2} \times Z_{2}$ from a viewpoint of the noncommutative differential geometry and the gauge theory in discrete space. The action for pure Yang-Mills theory in $R^{2} \times Z_{2}$ is equivalent to that for Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in $R^{2} $. 
0808.02397	Target mass corrections for spin-dependent structure functions in collinear factorization	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:A. Accardi, W. Melnitchouk	Abstract:  We derive target mass corrections (TMC) for the spin-dependent nucleon structure function g1 and polarization asymmetry A1 in collinear factorization at leading twist. The TMCs are found to be significant for g1 at large xB, even at relatively high Q^2 values, but largely cancel in A1. A comparison of TMCs obtained from collinear factorization and from the operator product expansion shows that at low Q^2 the corrections drive the proton A1 in opposite directions. 
0808.02398	Morphological Phases of Crumpled Wire	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:N. Stoop, F.K. Wittel, H.J. Herrmann	Abstract:  We find that in two dimensions wires can crumple into different morphologies and present the associated morphological phase diagram. Our results are based on experiments with different metallic wires and confirmed by numerical simulations using a discrete element model. We show that during crumpling, the number of loops increases according to a power-law with different exponents in each morphology. Furthermore, we observe a power-law divergence of the structure's bulk stiffness similar to what is observed in forced crumpling of membranes. 
0808.02399	Gluelump model with transverse constituent gluons	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:F. Buisseret	Abstract:  We show that C-odd gluelumps can be successfully described as bound states of a single transverse constituent gluon evolving in the flux-tube-like potential generated by a static color-octet source. The use of a helicity degree of freedom rather than a spin one for the constituent gluon forbids the states that are not observed in lattice QCD. Our model leads to a gluelump mass spectrum in remarkable agreement with the available lattice data provided that an additional parity-splitting mass term is introduced. We argue that such a term is due to instanton-induced interactions in gluelumps. 
0808.02400	Phonon distributions of a single bath mode coupled to a quantum dot	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:F. Cavaliere, G. Piovano, E. Paladino, M. Sassetti	Abstract:  The properties of an unconventional, single mode phonon bath coupled to a quantum dot, are investigated within the rotating wave approximation. The electron current through the dot induces an out of equilibrium bath, with a phonon distribution qualitatively different from the thermal one. In selected transport regimes, such a distribution is characterized by a peculiar selective population of few phonon modes and can exhibit a sub-Poissonian behavior. It is shown that such a sub-Poissonian behavior is favored by a double occupancy of the dot. The crossover from a unequilibrated to a conventional thermal bath is explored, and the limitations of the rotating wave approximation are discussed. 
0808.02401	The puzzle of magnetic resonance effect on the magnetic compass of migratory birds	Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)	Authors:K.V.Kavokin	Abstract:  Experiments on the effect of radio-frequency (RF) magnetic fields on the magnetic compass orientation of migratory birds are analyzed using the theory of magnetic resonance. The results of these experiments were earlier interpreted within the radical-pair model of magnetoreception. However, the consistent analysis shows that the amplitudes of the RF fields used are far too small to noticeably influence electron spins in organic radicals. Other possible agents that could mediate the birds' response to the RF fields are discussed, but apparently no known physical system can be responsible for this effect. 
0808.02402	Spin transport of indirect excitons in GaAs coupled quantum wells	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:J.R. Leonard, Sen Yang, L.V. Butov, A.C. Gossard	Abstract:  Spin transport of indirect excitons in GaAs/AlGaAs coupled quantum wells was observed by measuring the spatially resolved circular polarization of the exciton emission. The exciton spin transport originates from the long spin relaxation time and long lifetime of the indirect excitons. 
0808.02403	Phase Shift Sequences for an Adding Interferometer	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Peter Hyland, Brent Follin, Emory F. Bunn	Abstract:  Cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarimetry has the potential to provide revolutionary advances in cosmology. Future experiments to detect the very weak B mode signal in CMB polarization maps will require unprecedented sensitivity and control of systematic errors. Bolometric interferometry may provide a way to achieve these goals. In a bolometric interferometer (or other adding interferometer), phase shift sequences are applied to the inputs in order to recover the visibilities. Noise is minimized when the phase shift sequences corresponding to all visibilities are orthogonal. We present a systematic method for finding sequences that produce this orthogonality, approximately minimizing both the length of the time sequence and the number of discrete phase shift values required. When some baselines are geometrically equivalent, we can choose sequences that read out those baselines simultaneously, which has been shown to improve signal to noise ratio. 
0808.02404	The Infrared Luminosity of Galaxy Clusters	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Martin Giard (1), Ludovic Montier (1), Etienne Pointecouteau (1), Ellen Simmat (1 and 2) ((1) CESR, CNRS-Universit\'e de Toulouse, (2) MPI Heidelberg)    	Abstract:  The aim of this study is to quantify the infrared luminosity of clusters as a function of redshift and compare this with the X-ray luminosity. This can potentially constrain the origin of the infrared emission to be intracluster dust and/or dust heated by star formation in the cluster galaxies. We perform a statistical analysis of a large sample of galaxy clusters selected from existing databases and catalogues.We coadd the infrared IRAS and X-ray RASS images in the direction of the selected clusters within successive redshift intervals up to z = 1. We find that the total infrared luminosity is very high and on average 20 times higher than the X-ray luminosity. If all the infrared luminosity is to be attributed to emission from diffuse intracluster dust, then the IR to X-ray ratio implies a dust-to-gas mass abundance of 5e-4. However, the infrared luminosity shows a strong enhancement for 0.1 < z < 1, which cannot be attributed to cluster selection effects. We show that this enhancement is compatible with a star formation rate in the member galaxies that is typical of the central Mpc of the Coma cluster at z = 0 and evolves with the redshift as (1+z)^5. It is likely that most of the infrared luminosity that we measure is generated by the ongoing star formation in the member galaxies. From theoretical predictions calibrated on extinction measurements (dust mass abundance equal to 1e-5), we expect only a minor contribution, of a few percent, from intracluster dust. 
0808.02405	Alpha-Cluster States Populated in 24Mg+12C	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:C. Beck (IPHC Strasbourg), et al    	Abstract:  Charged particle and gamma decays in light alpha-like nuclei are investigated for 24Mg+12C. Various theoretical predictions for the occurence of superdeformed and hyperdeformed bands associated with resonance structures with low spin are presented. The inverse kinematics reaction 24Mg+12C is studied at Elab(24Mg) = 130 MeV. Exclusive data were collected with the Binary Reaction Spectrometer in coincidence with EUROBALL IV installed at the VIVITRON Tandem facility at Strasbourg. Specific structures with large deformation were selectively populated in binary reactions and their associated gamma decays studied. Coincident events from $α$-transfer channels were selected by choosing the excitation energy or the entry point via the two-body Q-values. The analysis of the binary reaction channels is presented with a particular emphasis on 20Ne-gamma and 16O-gamma coincidences. 
0808.02406	Quantum teleportation via a two-qubit Heisenberg XXZ chain-effects of anisotropy and magnetic field	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Yue Zhou, Guofeng Zhang	Abstract:  We study quantum teleportation via a two-qubit Heisenberg XXZ chain under an inhomogeneous magnetic field. We first consider entanglement teleportation, and then focus on the teleportation fidelity under different conditions. The effects of anisotropy and the magnetic field, both uniform and inhomogeneous, are discussed. We also find that, though entanglement teleportation does require an entangled quantum channel, a nonzero critical value of minimum entanglement is not always necessary. 
0808.02407	Geometric phase of a bipartite system with Dzyaloshinski-Moriya interaction	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Yue Zhou, Guo-Feng Zhang	Abstract:  The Berry phase of a bipartite system described by a Heisenberg XXZ model driven by a one-site magnetic field is investigated. The effect of the Dzyaloshinski-Moriya (DM) anisotropic interaction on the Berry phase is discussed. It is found that the DM interaction affects the Berry phase monotonously, and can also cause sudden change of the Berry phase for some weak magnetic field cases. 
0808.02408	Detecting Sound-Wave-Like Surface Brightness Ripples in Cluster Cores	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. Graham, A.C. Fabian, J.S. Sanders	Abstract:  We investigate the observational requirements for the detection of sound-wave-like features in galaxy cluster cores. We calculate the effect of projection on the observed wave amplitude, and find that the projection factor depends only weakly on the underlying cluster properties but strongly on the wavelength of the sound waves, with the observed amplitude being reduced by a factor ~5 for 5 kpc waves but only by a factor ~ 2 for 25 kpc waves. We go on to estimate the time needed to detect ripples similar to those previously detected in the Perseus cluster in other clusters. We find that the detection time scales most strongly with the flux of the cluster and the amplitude of the ripples. By connecting the ripple amplitude to the heating power in the system, we estimate detection times for a selection of local clusters and find that several may have ripples detected with ~1Ms Chandra time. 
0808.02409	Entangled quantum heat engines based on two two-spin systems with Dzyaloshinski-Moriya anisotropic antisymmetric interaction	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Guo-Feng Zhang	Abstract:  We construct an entangled quantum heat engine (EQHE) based on two two-spin systems with Dzyaloshinski-Moriya (DM) anisotropic antisymmetric interaction. By applying the explanations of heat transferred and work performed at the quantum level in Kieu's work [PRL, 93, 140403 (2004)], the basic thermodynamic quantities, i.e., heat transferred, net work done in a cycle and efficiency of EQHE are investigated in terms of DM interaction and concurrence. The validity of the second law of thermodynamics is confirmed in the entangled system. It is found that there is a same efficiency for both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic cases, and the efficiency can be controlled in two manners: 1. only by spin-spin interaction J and DM interaction D; 2. only by the temperature T and concurrence C. In order to obtain a positive net work, we need not entangle all qubits in two two-spin systems and we only require the entanglement between qubits in a two-spin system not be zero. As the ratio of entanglement between qubits in two two-spin systems increases, the efficiency will approach infinitely the classical Carnot one. An interesting phenomenon is an abrupt transition of the efficiency when the entanglements between qubits in two two-spin systems are equal. 
0808.02410	Testing the Majorana Nature of Gluinos and Neutralinos	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:S.Y. Choi, M. Drees, A. Freitas, P.M. Zerwas	Abstract:  Gluinos and neutralinos, supersymmetric partners of gluons and neutral electroweak gauge and Higgs bosons, are Majorana particles in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model [MSSM]. Decays of such self-conjugate particles generate charge symmetric ensembles of final states. Moreover, production channels of supersymmetric particles at colliders are characteristically affected by the Majorana nature of particles exchanged in the production processes. The sensitivity to the Majorana character of the particles can be quantified by comparing the predictions with Dirac exchange mechanisms. A consistent framework for introducing gluino and neutralino Dirac fields can be designed by extending the N=1 supersymmetry of the MSSM to N=2 in the gauge sector. We examine to which extent like-sign dilepton production in the processes q q -> ~q ~q and e- e- -> ~e- ~e- is affected by the exchange of either Majorana or Dirac gluinos and neutralinos, respectively, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and in the prospective e- e- mode of a lepton linear collider. 
0808.02411	Tropical R maps and Affine Geometric Crystals	Quantum Algebra (math.QA)	Authors:Masaki Kashiwara, Toshiki Nakashima, Masato Okado	Abstract:  By modifying the method in [KNO], certain affine geometric crystals are realized in affinization of the fundamental representation $W(\varpi_1)_l$ and the tropical R maps for the affine geometric crystals are described explicitly. We also define prehomogeneous geometric crystals and show that for a positive geometric crystal, the connectedness of the corresponding ultra-discretized crystal is the sufficient condition for prehomogeneity of the positive geometric crystal. Moreover, the uniqueness of tropical R maps is discussed. 
0808.02412	Relationship between vibrations and dynamical heterogeneity in a model glass former: extended soft modes but local relaxation	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Douglas J. Ashton, Juan P. Garrahan	Abstract:  We study the relation between short-time vibrational modes and long-time relaxational dynamics in a kinetically constrained lattice gas with harmonic interactions between neighbouring particles. We find a correlation between the location of the low (high) frequency vibrational modes and regions of high (low) propensity for motion. This is similar to what was observed in continuous force systems, but our interpretation is different: in our case relaxation is due to localised excitations which propagate through the system; these localised excitations act as background disorder for the elastic network, giving rise to anomalous vibrational modes. Our results show that a correlation between spatially extended low frequency modes and high propensity regions does not imply that relaxational dynamics originates in extended soft modes. We consider other measures of elastic heterogeneity, such as non-affine displacement fields and mode localisation lengths, and discuss implications of our results to interpretations of dynamic heterogeneity more generally. 
0808.02413	Imaging of granular sources in high energy heavy ion collisions	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Zhi-Tao Yang, Wei-Ning Zhang, Lei Huo, Jing-Bo Zhang	Abstract:  We investigate the source imaging for a granular pion-emitting source model in high energy heavy ion collisions. The two-pion source functions of the granular sources exhibit a two-tiered structure. Using a parametrized formula of granular two-pion source function, we examine the two-tiered structure of the source functions for the imaging data of Au+Au collisions at Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) and Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). We find that the imaging technique introduced by Brown and Danielewicz is suitable for probing the granular structure of the sources. Our data-fitting results indicate that there is not visible granularity for the sources at AGS energies. However, the data for the RHIC collisions with the selections of $40 < {\rm centrality} < 90%$ and $0.20<k_{\rm T}<0.36$ GeV/c are better described by the model with granular emission than that of one Gaussian. The model with granular source has more parameters than the simple Gaussian, hence can describe more complicated shapes. 
0808.02414	Properties of X-ray selected Broad Absorption Line Quasars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. J. Blustin, T. Dwelly, M. J. Page, I. M. McHardy, N. Seymour, J. A. Kennea, N. S. Loaring, K. O. Mason, K. Sekiguchi	Abstract:  Broad absorption line quasars (commonly termed BALQSOs) contain the most dramatic examples of AGN-driven winds. The high absorbing columns in these winds, ~10^24 cm^-2, ensure that BALQSOs are generally X-ray faint. This high X-ray absorption means that almost all BALQSOs have been discovered through optical surveys, and so what little we know about their X-ray properties is derived from very bright optically-selected sources. A small number of X-ray selected BALQSOs (XBALQSOs) have, however, recently been found in deep X-ray survey fields. In this paper we investigate the X-ray and rest-frame UV properties of five XBALQSOs for which we have obtained XMM-Newton EPIC X-ray spectra and deep optical imaging and spectroscopy. We find that, although the XBALQSOs have an alpha_ox steeper by ~0.5 than normal QSOs, their median alpha_ox is nevertheless flatter by 0.30 than that of a comparable sample of optically selected BALQSOs (OBALQSOs). We rule out the possibility that the higher X-ray to optical flux ratio is due to intrinsic optical extinction. We find that the amount of X-ray and UV absorption due to the wind in XBALQSOs is similar, or perhaps greater than, the corresponding wind absorption in OBALQSOs, so the flatter alpha_ox cannot be a result of weaker wind absorption. We conclude that these XBALQSOs have intrinsically higher X-ray to optical flux ratios than the OBALQSO sample with which we compare them. 
0808.02415	Decision Theory is a Red Herring for the Many Worlds Interpretation	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Jacques Mallah	Abstract:  There have been many attempts over the years to derive the Born Rule from the wave equation since Everett's Many Worlds Interpretation was proposed; however, none of these have been satisfactory as shown when critics pointed out loopholes and unsupported assumptions. In this paper the case is made that the currently fashionable decision-theoretic approach founded by David Deutsch and explicated by David Wallace is likewise unsatisfactory. A more fundamental computationalist approach is advocated. 
0808.02416	Highly-flexible wide angle of incidence terahertz metamaterial absorber	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Hu Tao, C. M. Bingham, A. C. Strikwerda, D. Pilon, D. Shrekenhamer, N. I. Landy, K. Fan, X. Zhang, W. J. Padilla, R. D. Averitt	Abstract:  We present the design, fabrication, and characterization of a metamaterial absorber which is resonant at terahertz frequencies. We experimentally demonstrate an absorptivity of 0.97 at 1.6 terahertz. Importantly, this free-standing absorber is only 16 microns thick resulting in a highly flexible material that, further, operates over a wide range of angles of incidence for both transverse electric and transverse magnetic radiation. 
0808.02417	On NFAs Where All States are Final, Initial, or Both	Computational Complexity (cs.CC)	Authors:Jui-Yi Kao, Narad Rampersad, Jeffrey Shallit	Abstract:  We examine questions involving nondeterministic finite automata where all states are final, initial, or both initial and final. First, we prove hardness results for the nonuniversality and inequivalence problems for these NFAs. Next, we characterize the languages accepted. Finally, we discuss some state complexity problems involving such automata. 
0808.02418	Superstring and Superstring Field Theory: a new solution using Ultradistributions of Exponential Type	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:C. G. Bollini, M. C. Rocca	Abstract:  In this paper we show that Ultradistributions of Exponential Type (UET) are appropriate for the description in a consistent way superstring and superstring field theories. A new Lagrangian for the closed superstring is given. We show that the superstring field is a linear superposition of UET of compact support, and give the notion of anti-superstring. We evaluate the propagator for the superstring field, and calculate the convolution of two of them. 
0808.02419	Embedding operators into strongly continuous semigroups	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Tanja Eisner	Abstract:  We study linear operators $T$ on Banach spaces for which there exists a $C_0$-semigroup $(T(t))_{t\geq 0}$ such that $T=T(1)$. We present a necessary condition in terms of the spectral value 0 and give classes of examples where this can or cannot be achieved. 
0808.02420	A local scheme accounting for EPR quantum correlations	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:A. Matzkin	Abstract:  A model for two entangled systems in an EPR setting is shown to reproduce the quantum-mechanical outcomes and expectation values. Each system is represented by a small sphere containing a point-like particle embedded in a field. A quantum state appears as an equivalence class of several possible particle-field configurations. Contrarily to Bell-type hidden variables models, the fields account for the non-commutative aspects of the measurements and deny the simultaneous reality of incompatible physical quantities, thereby allowing to escape EPR's "completeness or locality" dilemma. 
0808.02421	Dynamics of driven vortex-antivortex matter in superconducting films with a magnetic dipole array	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Cléssio L. S. Lima (1 and 2), Clécio C. de Souza Silva (1). ((1) Departamento de F\'isica, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, (2) Instituto de F\'isica, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro)    	Abstract:  We investigate theoretically vortex-antivortex (v-av) matter moving in thin superconducting films with a regular array of in-plane magnetic dipoles. Our model considers v-av pair creation induced by the local current density generated by the magnetic texture and the transport current and simulates the dynamics of vortices and antivortices by numerical integration of the Langevin equation of motion. Calculations of the transport properties at zero applied field show a strong dependence of the v-av dynamics on the current intensity and direction. The dynamics of the v-av matter is characterized by a series of creation and annihilation processes, which reflect on the time dependence of the electrical field, and by guided motion, resulting in a zero-field transverse resistance. 
0808.02422	A study of the electromagnetic fluctuation induced forces on thin metallic films	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Andrea Benassi, Carlo Calandra	Abstract:  Using the plasma model for the metal dielectric function we have calculated the electromagnetic fluctuation induced forces on a free standing metallic film in vacuum as a function of the film size and the plasma frequency. The force for unit area is attractive and for a given film thickness it shows an intensity maximum at a specific plasma value, which cannot be predicted on the basis of a non retarded description of the electromagnetic interaction. If the film is deposited on a substrate or interacts with a plate, both the sign and the value of the force are modified. It is shown that the force can change sign from attraction to repulsion upon changing the substrate plasma frequency. A detailed comparison between the force on the film boundaries and the force between film and substrate indicates that, for 50-100 nm thick films, they are comparable when film-substrate distance is of the order of the film thickness. 
0808.02423	Graphs, Frobenius functionals, and the classical Yang-Baxter equation	Quantum Algebra (math.QA)	Authors:Murray Gerstenhaber, Anthony Giaquinto	Abstract:  A Lie algebra is Frobenius if it admits a linear functional F such that the Kirillov form F([x,y]) is non-degenerate. If g is the m-th maximal parabolic subalgebra P(n,m) of sl(n) this occurs precisely when (n,m) = 1. We define a "cyclic" functional F on P(n,m) and prove it is non-degenerate using properties of certain graphs associated to F. These graphs also provide in some cases readily computable associated solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation. We also define a local ring associated to each connected loopless graph from which we show that the graph can be reconstructed. Finally, we examine the seaweed Lie algebras of Dergachev and Kirillov from our perspective. 
0808.02424	The age incidence of any cancer can be explained by a one-mutation model	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Rinaldo B. Schinazi	Abstract:  We propose a one mutation model for cancer with a mutation rate that increases with time. Under rather general hypotheses the number of mutations is necessarily a (non homogeneous) Poisson process with the prescribed mutation rate. We show that the cumulative probability of cancer up to time $t$ is, up to a multiplicative constant, an antiderivative of the mutation rate. 
0808.02425	Solving the $η$-Problem in Hybrid Inflation with Heisenberg Symmetry and Stabilized Modulus	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Stefan Antusch, Mar Bastero-Gil, Koushik Dutta, Steve F. King, Philipp M. Kostka	Abstract:  We propose a class of models in which the $η$-problem of supersymmetric hybrid inflation is resolved using a Heisenberg symmetry, where the associated modulus field is stabilized and made heavy with the help of the large vacuum energy during inflation without any fine-tuning. The proposed class of models is well motivated both from string theory considerations, since it includes the commonly encountered case of no-scale supergravity Kaehler potential, and from the perspective of particle physics since a natural candidate for the inflaton in this class of models is the right-handed sneutrino which is massless during the inflationary epoch, and subsequently acquires a large mass at the end of inflation. We study a specific example motivated by sneutrino hybrid inflation with no-scale supergravity in some detail, and show that the spectral index may lie within the latest WMAP range, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio is very small. 
0808.02426	Experiments on propagating and branching positive streamers in air	Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)	Authors:T.M.P. Briels, E.M. van Veldhuizen, Ute Ebert	Abstract:  This proceedings paper from 2004 contains figures of discharges in different gap lengths at the same potential that are not available elsewhere. The 2004 abstract: The evolution of streamers is known to depend on gas composition and electrode geometry, on polarity and size of the voltage and also on the electric circuit that produces the high voltage pulse. To characterize the phenomena better and to compare with theory, a new larger experimental setup with vacuum enclosure has been built. We here present first results in this setup on positive streamers in air at fixed voltage and varying electrode distance. While next to the emitting anode tip, a similar number of streamers seems to emerge due to multiple branching, more streamers seem to survive over a fixed distance, when the gap is shorter. When lowering the voltage, streamers branch less at all distances from the anode tip or do not branch at all beyond a certain distance. 
0808.02427	On the genuine bound states of a non-relativistic particle in a linear finite range potential	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Nagalakshmi A Rao, B. A. Kagali	Abstract:  We explore the energy spectrum of a non-relativistic particle bound in a linear finite range, attractive potential, envisaged as a quark-confining potential. The intricate transcendental eigenvalue equation is solved numerically to obtain the explicit eigen-energies. The linear potential, which resembles the triangular well, has potential significance in particle physics and exciting applications in electronics. 
0808.02428	Author-choice open access publishing in the biological and medical literature: a citation analysis	Digital Libraries (cs.DL)	Authors:Philip M. Davis	Abstract:  In this article, we analyze the citations to articles published in 11 biological and medical journals from 2003 to 2007 that employ author-choice open access models. Controlling for known explanatory predictors of citations, only 2 of the 11 journals show positive and significant open access effects. Analyzing all journals together, we report a small but significant increase in article citations of 17%. In addition, there is strong evidence to suggest that the open access advantage is declining by about 7% per year, from 32% in 2004 to 11% in 2007. 
0808.02429	Role of vacuum fluctuation forces in thin metal film stability	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Andrea Benassi, Carlo Calandra	Abstract:  Thin metal films are subject to the pressure caused by the zero point oscillations of the electromagnetic field, which depends upon the film optical properties and, in case of deposition onto a substrate, upon the substrate reflectivity. It has been suggested that this force may be relevant in determining the stability of deposited pseudomorphic films with respect to buckling or island formation. We present a detailed analysis of its behaviour as a function of the optical parameters and of the film thickness and we illustrate the conditions under which it may play some role. For free standing films it turns out that the film stabilization is basically due to the surface stress, which largely overwhelms the vacuum force. For epilayers on metal substrate the vacuum force may be important, and we give stability diagrams and critical thicknesses for several cases, illustrating how the flat surface growth may depend upon the film parameters. The importance of including retardation effects into the theory for a realistic determination of the stability conditions is also discussed. 
0808.02430	Hopping conduction in strong electric fields: Negative differential conductivity	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:A. V. Nenashev, F. Jansson, S. D. Baranovskii, R. Österbacka, A. V. Dvurechenskii, F. Gebhard	Abstract:  Effects of strong electric fields on hopping conductivity are studied theoretically. Monte-Carlo computer simulations show that the analytical theory of Nguyen and Shklovskii [Solid State Commun. 38, 99 (1981)] provides an accurate description of hopping transport in the limit of very high electric fields and low concentrations of charge carriers as compared to the concentration of localization sites and also at the relative concentration of carriers equal to 0.5. At intermediate concentrations of carriers between 0.1 and 0.5 computer simulations evidence essential deviations from the results of the existing analytical theories. The theory of Nguyen and Shklovskii also predicts a negative differential hopping conductivity at high electric fields. Our numerical calculations confirm this prediction qualitatively. However the field dependence of the drift velocity of charge carriers obtained numerically differs essentially from the one predicted so far. Analytical theory is further developed so that its agreement with numerical results is essentially improved. 
0808.02431	A Simple E-Voting Protocol	Computers and Society (cs.CY)	Authors:Frederic Connes	Abstract:  We propose an e-voting protocol that seems to allow citizens to verify that their vote has been accurately taken into account while preserving its secrecy, without requiring the use of a complex process. The main idea is to give each voter a receipt on which her choice is mixed with the choices of other voters. 
0808.02432	The construction of non-spherical models of quasi-relaxed stellar systems	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:G. Bertin, A.L. Varri (Universit\`a degli Studi di Milano, Dipartimento di Fisica)    	Abstract:  Spherical models of collisionless but quasi-relaxed stellar systems have long been studied as a natural framework for the description of globular clusters. Here we consider the construction of self-consistent models under the same physical conditions, but including explicitly the ingredients that lead to departures from spherical symmetry. In particular, we focus on the effects of the tidal field associated with the hosting galaxy. We then take a stellar system on a circular orbit inside a galaxy represented as a "frozen" external field. The equilibrium distribution function is obtained from the one describing the spherical case by replacing the energy integral with the relevant Jacobi integral in the presence of the external tidal field. Then the construction of the model requires the investigation of a singular perturbation problem for an elliptic partial differential equation with a free boundary, for which we provide a method of solution to any desired order, with explicit solutions to two orders. We outline the relevant parameter space, thus opening the way to a systematic study of the properties of a two-parameter family of physically justified non-spherical models of quasi-relaxed stellar systems. The general method developed here can also be used to construct models for which the non-spherical shape is due to internal rotation. Eventually, the models will be a useful tool to investigate whether the shapes of globular clusters are primarily determined by internal rotation, by external tides, or by pressure anisotropy. 
0808.02433	Maximal regularity for parabolic partial differential equations on manifolds with cylindrical ends	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Thomas Krainer	Abstract:  We give a short, simple proof of maximal regularity for linear parabolic evolution equations on manifolds with cylindrical ends by making use of pseudodifferential parametrices and the concept of R-boundedness for the resolvent. 
0808.02434	Deformations of the Tracy-Widom distribution	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:O. Bohigas, J. X. de Carvalho, M. P. Pato	Abstract:  In random matrix theory (RMT), the Tracy-Widom (TW) distribution describes the behavior of the largest eigenvalue. We consider here two models in which TW undergoes transformations. In the first one disorder is introduced in the Gaussian ensembles by superimposing an external source of randomness. A competition between TW and a normal (Gaussian) distribution results, depending on the spreading of the disorder. The second model consists in removing at random a fraction of (correlated) eigenvalues of a random matrix. The usual formalism of Fredholm determinants extends naturally. A continuous transition from TW to the Weilbull distribution, characteristc of extreme values of an uncorrelated sequence, is obtained. 
0808.02435	A Study of H2 Emission in Three Bipolar Proto-Planetary Nebulae: IRAS 16594-4656, Hen 3-401, and Rob 22	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Bruce J. Hrivnak, Nathan Smith, Kate Y. L. Su, Raghvendra Sahai	Abstract:  We have carried out a spatial-kinematical study of three proto-planetary nebulae, IRAS 16594-4656, Hen 3-401, and Rob 22. High-resolution H2 images were obtained with NICMOS on the HST and high-resolution spectra were obtained with the Phoenix spectrograph on Gemini-South. IRAS 16594-4656 shows a "peanut-shaped" bipolar structure with H2 emission from the walls and from two pairs of more distant, point-symmetric faint blobs. The velocity structure shows the polar axis to be in the plane of the sky, contrary to the impression given by the more complex visual image and the visibility of the central star, with an ellipsoidal velocity structure. Hen 3-401 shows the H2 emission coming from the walls of the very elongated, open-ended lobes seen in visible light, along with a possible small disk around the star. The bipolar lobes appear to be tilted 10-15 deg with respect to the plane of the sky and their kinematics display a Hubble-like flow. In Rob 22, the H2 appears in the form of an "S" shape, approximately tracing out the similar pattern seen in the visible. H2 is especially seen at the ends of the lobes and at two opposite regions close to the unseen central star. The axis of the lobes is nearly in the plane of the sky. Expansion ages of the lobes are calculated to be approximately 1600 yr (IRAS 16594-4656), 1100 yr (Hen 3-401), and 640 yr (Rob 22), based upon approximate distances. 
0808.02436	Resolving temporal Gribov copies in Coulomb gauge Yang-Mills theory	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Hugo Reinhardt, Peter Watson	Abstract:  The continuum Yang-Mills functional integral within the first order formalism and in Coulomb gauge is studied. In particular, the temporal zero-modes of the Faddeev-Popov operator are explicitly accounted for. It is shown that the treatment of these zero-modes results in the constraint that the total color charge of the system vanishes at all times. Further, it is argued that the functional integral is effectively fully gauge-fixed once Gauss' law has been resolved in Coulomb gauge. 
0808.02437	A Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Galactic Cosmic Ray physics: I. Method and results for the Leaky Box Model	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Putze, L. Derome, D. Maurin, L. Perotto, R. Taillet	Abstract:  Propagation of charged cosmic-rays in the Galaxy depends on the transport parameters, whose number can be large depending on the propagation model under scrutiny. A standard approach for determining these parameters is a manual scan, leading to an inefficient and incomplete coverage of the parameter space. We implement a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which is well suited to multi-parameter determination. Its specificities (burn-in length, acceptance, and correlation length) are discussed in the phenomenologically well-understood Leaky-Box Model. From a technical point of view, a trial function based on binary-space partitioning is found to be extremely efficient, allowing a simultaneous determination of up to nine parameters, including transport and source parameters, such as slope and abundances. Our best-fit model includes both a low energy cut-off and reacceleration, whose values are consistent with those found in diffusion models. A Kolmogorov spectrum for the diffusion slope (delta=1/3) is excluded. The marginalised probability-density function for delta and alpha (the slope of the source spectra) are delta~0.55-0.60 and alpha~2.14-2.17, depending on the dataset used and the number of free parameters in the fit. All source-spectrum parameters (slope and abundances) are positively correlated among themselves and with the reacceleration strength, but are negatively correlated with the other propagation parameters. A forthcoming study will extend our analysis to more physical diffusion models. 
0808.02438	Vacuum fluctuation forces between ultra-thin films	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Andrea Benassi, Carlo Calandra	Abstract:  We have investigated the role of the quantum size effects in the evaluation of the force caused by electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations between ultra-thin films, using the dielectric tensor derived from the particle in a box model. Comparison with the results obtained by adopting a continuum dielectric model shows that, for film thicknesses of 1-10 nm, the electron confinement causes changes in the force intensity with respect to the isotropic plasma model which range from 40% to few percent depending upon the film electron density and the film separation. The calculated force shows quantum size oscillations, which can be significant for film separation distances of several nanometers. The role of electron confinement in reducing the large distance Casimir force is discussed.

0808.02441	Extremely red stellar objects revealed by IPHAS	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:N.J. Wright, R. Greimel, M.J. Barlow, J.E. Drew, M.-R.L. Cioni, A.A. Zijlstra, R.L.M. Corradi, E.A. González-Solares, P. Groot, J. Irwin, M.J. Irwin, A. Mampaso, R.A.H. Morris, D. Steeghs, Y.C. Unruh, N. Walton	Abstract:  We present photometric analysis and follow-up spectroscopy for a population of extremely red stellar objects extracted from the point-source catalogue of the INT Photometric H-Alpha Survey (IPHAS) of the northern galactic plane. The vast majority of these objects have no previous identification. Analysis of optical, near- and mid-infrared photometry reveals that they are mostly highly-reddened asymptotic giant branch stars, with significant levels of circumstellar material. We show that the distribution of these objects traces galactic extinction, their highly reddened colours being a product of both interstellar and circumstellar reddening. This is the first time that such a large sample of evolved low-mass stars has been detected in the visual and allows optical counterparts to be associated with sources from recent infrared surveys. Follow-up spectroscopy on some of the most interesting objects in the sample has found significant numbers of S-type stars which can be clearly separated from oxygen-rich objects in the IPHAS colour-colour diagram. We show that this is due to the positions of different molecular bands relative to the narrow-band H-alpha filter used for IPHAS observations. The IPHAS (r' - H-alpha) colour offers a valuable diagnostic for identifying S-type stars. A selection method for identifying S-type stars in the galactic plane is briefly discussed and we estimate that over a thousand new objects of this type may be discovered, potentially doubling the number of known objects in this short but important evolutionary phase. 
0808.02442	d- and f-orbital correlations in the REFeAsO compounds	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:T. Miyake, L. Pourovskii, V. Vildosola, S. Biermann, A. Georges	Abstract:  We estimate theoretically the strength of the local Coulomb interaction for the Fe 3d and Ce 4f shells in the REFeAsO compunds. In LaFeAsO and CeFeAsO we obtain values of the local Coulomb interaction parameter U for both Fe and Ce which are larger than those of elemental Fe and Ce metals. The Fe 3d bandwidth of REFeAsO is found to increase slightly as one moves along the RE-series. Using a combined local density approximation and dynamical mean-field theory (LDA+DMFT) approach, we study the behaviour of the localized 4f states along the rare-earth oxyarsenides REFeAsO series (RE=Ce,Pr,Nd). In CeFeAsO the occupied Ce 4f band is located just below the Fe 3d band leading possibly to a Kondo screening of the 4f local moment under applied pressure, while the unscreened local moment behaviour is expected for the Pr and Nd compounds. 
0808.02443	The Schrödinger equation with piercings	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Paolo Amore	Abstract:  We show that the spectrum of the Schrödinger equation in two or higher dimensions does not change when Dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced on a number of isolated points inside the original domain (piercings). We have obtained the analytical solution for spherically symmetric state of the $d$-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator pierced at the origin. Results for the case with multiple piercings are obtained numerically and agree with the theoretical prediction. In the case of a two dimensional parabolic quantum dot with two electrons and a single piercing in the origin we show that the energy of the ground state calculated to first order in perturbation theory goes over to the equivalent result in absence of piercing as the radius of the piercing becomes infinitesimal. Interestingly, we find that the leading finite size correction to the interaction energy is negative while the corresponding correction to the single particle energies is (as expected) positive. For a finite radius of the piercing and above a critical coupling, the first term dominates the second and the total energy of the dot with piercing is lower. Unfortunately the critical coupling found for this example is nonperturbative. Finally we study configurations allowing bound states in the continuum, showing that bound states survive to the insertion of piercings and that their energy is unchanged when the radius of the piercing vanishes. 
0808.02444	Strong generic vanishing and a higher dimensional Castelnuovo-de Franchis inequality	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Giuseppe Pareschi, Mihnea Popa	Abstract:  We extend to manifolds of arbitrary dimension the Castelnuovo-de Franchis inequality for surfaces. The proof is based on the theory of Generic Vanishing and higher regularity, and on the Evans-Griffith Syzygy Theorem in commutative algebra. Along the way we give a positive answer, in the setting of Kähler manifolds, to a question of Green-Lazarsfeld on the vanishing of higher direct images of Poincaré bundles. We indicate generalizations to arbitrary Fourier-Mukai transforms. 
0808.02445	Observation of an enhancement in e+e- to Upsilon(1S)pi+pi-, Upsilon(2S)pi+pi-, and Upsilon(3S)pi+pi- production near sqrt{s}=10.89 GeV at Belle	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The Belle Collaboration: K.-F. Chen, W.-S. Hou, et al    	Abstract:  We measure the production cross sections for e+e- -> Upsilon(1S)pi+pi-, Upsilon(2S)pi+pi-, and Upsilon(3S)pi+pi- as a function of sqrt{s} between 10.83 GeV and 11.02 GeV. The data consists of 8.1 fb^-1 collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB e+e- collider. We observe enhanced production in all three final states that does not agree well with the conventional Upsilon(10860) lineshape. A fit using a Breit-Wigner resonance shape yields a peak mass of [10888.4 +2.7/-2.6 (stat) +- 1.2 (syst)] MeV/c^2 and a width of [30.7 +8.3/-7.0 (stat) +- 3.1 (syst)] MeV/c^2. 
0808.02446	Search for Supersymmetry in ppbar Collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV Using the Trilepton Signature for Chargino-Neutralino Production	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:CDF Collaboration: T. Aaltonen, et al    	Abstract:  We use the three lepton and missing energy "trilepton" signature to search for chargino-neutralino production with 2.0 inverse femtobarns of integrated luminosity collected by the CDF II experiment at the Tevatron ppbar collider. We expect an excess of approximately 11 supersymmetric events for a choice of parameters of the mSUGRA model, but our observation of 7 events is consistent with the standard model expectation of 6.4 events. We constrain the mSUGRA model of supersymmetry and rule out chargino masses up to 145 GeV/c^2 for a specific choice of parameters. 
0808.02447	Quadratic reciprocity and the sign of the Gauss sum via the finite Weil representation	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Shamgar Gurevich (UC Berkeley), Ronny Hadani (U of Chicago), Roger Howe (Yale)    	Abstract:  We give new proofs of two basic results in number theory: The law of quadratic reciprocity and the sign of the Gauss sum. We show that these results are encoded in the relation between the discrete Fourier transform and the action of the Weyl element in the Weil representation modulo p,q and pq. 
0808.02448	Three-point Green function of massless QED in position space to lowest order	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Indrajit Mitra	Abstract:  The transverse part of the three-point Green function of massless QED is determined to the lowest order in position space. Taken together with the evaluation of the longitudinal part in arXiv:0803.2630, this gives a relation for QED which is analogous to the star-triangle relation. We relate our result to conformal-invariant three-point functions. 
0808.02449	Infrared Propagator Corrections for Constant Deceleration	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:T. M. Janssen (Utrecht), S. P. Miao (Utrecht), T. Prokopec (Utrecht), R. P. Woodard (Florida)    	Abstract:  We derive the propagator for a massless, minimally coupled scalar on a $D$-dimensional, spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic background with arbitrary constant deceleration parameter. Our construction uses the operator formalism, by integrating the Fourier mode sum. We give special attention to infrared corrections from the nonzero lower limit associated with working on finite spatial sections. These corrections eliminate infrared divergences that would otherwise be incorrectly treated by dimensional regularization, resulting in off-coincidence divergences for those special values of the deceleration parameter at which the infrared divergence is logarithmic. As an application we compute the expectation value of the scalar stress-energy tensor. 
0808.02450	An Instanton Toolbox for F-Theory Model Building	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Joseph Marsano, Natalia Saulina, Sakura Schafer-Nameki	Abstract:  Several dimensionful parameters needed for model building can be engineered in a certain class of SU(5) F-theory GUTs by adding extra singlet fields which are localized along pairwise intersections of D7-branes. The values of these parameters, however, depend on dynamics external to the GUT which causes the singlets to acquire suitable masses or expectation values. In this note, we demonstrate that D3-instantons which wrap the same 4-cycle as one of the intersecting D7's can provide precisely the needed dynamics to generate several important scales, including the supersymmetry-breaking scale and the right-handed neutrino mass. Furthermore, these instantons seem unable to directly generate the μterm suggesting that, at least in this class of models, it should perhaps be tied to one of the other scales in the problem. More specifically, we study the simple system consisting of a pair of D7-branes wrapping del Pezzo surfaces which intersect along a curve $Σ$ of genus 0 or 1 and classify all instanton configurations which can potentially contribute to the superpotential. This allows one to formulate topological conditions which must be imposed on Σfor various model-building applications. Along the way, we also observe that the construction of arXiv:0808.1286 which engineers a linear superpotential in fact realizes an O'Raifeartaigh model at the KK scale whose 1-loop Coleman-Weinberg potential generically leads to a metastable, long-lived SUSY-breaking vacuum. 
0808.02451	Bergman Kernel from Path Integral	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Michael R. Douglas, Semyon Klevtsov	Abstract:  We rederive the expansion of the Bergman kernel on Kahler manifolds developed by Tian, Yau, Zelditch, Lu and Catlin, using path integral and perturbation theory, and generalize it to supersymmetric quantum mechanics. One physics interpretation of this result is as an expansion of the projector of wave functions on the lowest Landau level, in the special case that the magnetic field is proportional to the Kahler form. This is relevant for the quantum Hall effect in curved space, and for its higher dimensional generalizations. Other applications include the theory of coherent states, the study of balanced metrics, noncommutative field theory, and a conjecture on metrics in black hole backgrounds. We give a short overview of these various topics. From a conceptual point of view, this expansion is noteworthy as it is a geometric expansion, somewhat similar to the DeWitt-Seeley-Gilkey et al short time expansion for the heat kernel, but in this case describing the long time limit, without depending on supersymmetry. 
0808.02452	Observation of Distinct Electron-Phonon Couplings in Gated Bilayer Graphene	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:L. M. Malard, D. C. Elias, E. S. Alves, M. A. Pimenta	Abstract:  A Raman study of a back gated bilayer graphene sample is presented. The changes in the Fermi level induced by charge transfer splits the Raman G-band, hardening its higher component and softening the lower one. These two components are associated with the symmetric (S) and anti-symmetric vibration (AS) of the atoms in the two layers, the later one becoming Raman active due to inversion symmetry breaking. The phonon hardening and softening are explained by considering the selective coupling of the S and AS phonons with interband and intraband electron-hole pairs. 
0808.02453	The Knudsen temperature jump and the Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics of granular gases driven by thermal walls	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Evgeniy Khain, Baruch Meerson, Pavel V. Sasorov	Abstract:  Thermal wall is a convenient idealization of a rapidly vibrating plate used for vibrofluidization of granular materials. The objective of this work is to incorporate the Knudsen temperature jump at thermal wall in the Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic modeling of dilute granular gases of monodisperse particles that collide nearly elastically. The Knudsen temperature jump manifests itself as an additional term, proportional to the temperature gradient, in the boundary condition for the temperature. Up to a numerical pre-factor of order unity, this term is known from kinetic theory of elastic gases. We determine the previously unknown numerical pre-factor by measuring, in a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, steady-state temperature profiles of a gas of elastically colliding hard disks, confined between two thermal walls kept at different temperatures, and comparing the results with the predictions of a hydrodynamic calculation employing the modified boundary condition. The modified boundary condition is then applied, without any adjustable parameters, to a hydrodynamic calculation of the temperature profile of a gas of inelastic hard disks driven by a thermal wall. We find the hydrodynamic prediction to be in very good agreement with MD simulations of the same system. The results of this work pave the way to a more accurate hydrodynamic modeling of driven granular gases. 
0808.02454	(pi,pi)-electronic order in iron arsenide superconductors	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:V. B. Zabolotnyy, D. S. Inosov, D. V. Evtushinsky, A. Koitzsch, A. A. Kordyuk, G. L. Sun, J. T. Park, D. Haug, V. Hinkov, A. V. Boris, C. T. Lin, M. Knupfer, A. N. Yaresko, B. Buechner, A. Varykhalov, R. Follath, S. V. Borisenko	Abstract:  The distribution of valence electrons in metals usually follows the symmetry of an ionic lattice. Modulations of this distribution often occur when those electrons are not stable with respect to a new electronic order, such as spin or charge density waves. Electron density waves have been observed in many families of superconductors[1-3], and are often considered to be essential for superconductivity to exist[4]. Recent measurements[5-9] seem to show that the properties of the iron pnictides[10, 11] are in good agreement with band structure calculations that do not include additional ordering, implying no relation between density waves and superconductivity in those materials[12-15]. Here we report that the electronic structure of Ba1-xKxFe2As2 is in sharp disagreement with those band structure calculations[12-15], instead revealing a reconstruction characterized by a (pi,pi) wave vector. This electronic order coexists with superconductivity and persists up to room temperature. 
0808.02455	Low energy spin waves and magnetic interactions in SrFe$_2$As$_2$	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Jun Zhao, Dao-Xin Yao, Shiliang Li, Tao Hong, Y. Chen, S. Chang, W. Ratcliff II, J. W. Lynn, H. A. Mook, G. F. Chen, J. L. Luo, N. L. Wang, E. W. Carlson, Jiangping Hu, Pengcheng Dai	Abstract:  We report inelastic neutron scattering studies of magnetic excitations in antiferromagnetically ordered SrFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ ($T_{N}=220$ K), the parent compound of the FeAs-based superconductors. At low temperatures (T=7 K), the spectrum of magnetic excitations $S(Q,\hbar ω)$ consists of a Bragg peak at the elastic position ($\hbar ω=0$ meV), a spin gap ($ Δ\leq 6.5$ meV), and sharp spin wave excitations at higher energies. Based on the observed dispersion relation, we estimate the effective magnetic exchange coupling using a Heisenberg model. On warming across $T_{N} $, the low temperature spin gap rapidly closes, with weak critical scattering and spin-spin correlations in the paramagnetic state. The antiferromagnetic order in SrFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ is therefore consistent with a first order phase transition, similar to the structural lattice distortion. 
0808.02456	Experimentally testable state-independent quantum contextuality	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Adan Cabello	Abstract:  We show that there are Bell-type inequalities for noncontextual theories that are violated by any quantum state. One of these inequalities between the correlations of compatible measurements is particularly suitable for testing this state-independent violation in an experiment. 
0808.02457	Multivariable operator-valued Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation: a survey	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:J.A. Ball, S. ter Horst	Abstract:  The theory of Nevanlinna-Pick and Carathéodory-Fejér interpolation for matrix- and operator-valued Schur class functions on the unit disk is now well established. Recent work has produced extensions of the theory to a variety of multivariable settings, including the ball and the polydisk (both commutative and noncommutative versions), as well as a time-varying analogue. Largely independent of this is the recent Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation theorem by P.S. Muhly and B. Solel for an abstract Hardy algebra set in the context of a Fock space built from a $W^*$-correspondence E over a $W^{*}$-algebra $\cA$ and a *-representation $σ$ of $\cA$. In this review we provide an exposition of the Muhly-Solel interpolation theory accessible to operator theorists, and explain more fully the connections with the already existing interpolation literature. The abstract point evaluation first introduced by Muhly-Solel leads to a tensor-product type functional calculus in the main examples. A second kind of point-evaluation for the $W^*$-correspondence Hardy algebra, also introduced by Muhly and Solel, is here further investigated, and a Nevanlinna-Pick theorem in this setting is proved. It turns out that, when specified for examples, this alternative point-evaluation leads to an operator-argument functional calculus and corresponding Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation. We also discuss briefly several Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation results for Schur classes that do not fit into the Muhly-Solel $W^*$-correspondence formalism. 
0808.02458	QCD at complex coupling, large order in perturbation theory and the gluon condensate	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Y. Meurice	Abstract:  We discuss the relationship between the large order behavior of the perturbative series for the average plaquette in pure gauge theory and singularities in the complex coupling plane. We discuss simple extrapolations of the large order for this series. We point out that when these extrapolated series are subtracted from the Monte Carlo data, one obtains (naive) estimates of the gluon condensate that are significantly larger than values commonly used in the continuum for phenomelogical purpose. We present numerical results concerning the zeros of the partition function in the complex coupling plane (Fisher's zeros). We report recent attempts to solve this problem using the density of states. We show that weak and strong coupling expansions for the density of states agree surprisingly well for values of the action relevant for the crossover regime. 
0808.02459	New measurement of the K+ => pi+,nu,nubar branching ratio	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:E949 Collaboration	Abstract:  Three events for the decay K+ => pi+,nu,nubar have been observed in the pion momentum region below the K+ => pi+,pi0 peak, 140 < P_pi < 199 MeV/c, with an estimated background of 0.93+-0.17(stat.)+0.32-0.24(syst.) events. Combining this observation with previously reported results yields a branching ratio of B(K+ => pi+,nu,nubar) = (1.73+1.15-1.05)e-10 consistent with the standard model prediction.

0808.02462	Thermal relic abundances of long-lived staus	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Josef Pradler, Frank Daniel Steffen	Abstract:  In supersymmetric models with a long-lived stau being the lightest Standard Model superpartner, the stau abundance during primordial nucleosynthesis is tightly constrained. Considering the complete set of stau annihilation channels in the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with real parameters for scenarios in which sparticle coannihilations are negligible, we calculate the decoupling of the lighter stau from the primordial plasma and identify processes which are capable to deplete the resulting stau abundance significantly. We find particularly efficient stau annihilation at the resonance of the heavy CP-even Higgs boson and for a lighter stau with a sizeable left-right mixing due to enhanced stau-Higgs couplings. Even within the constrained MSSM, we encounter both effects leading to exceptionally small values of the resulting stau abundance. Prospects for collider phenomenology are discussed and possible implications of our findings are addressed with emphasis on gravitino dark matter scenarios. 
0808.02463	SO(3) quantum invariants are dense	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Helen M. Wong	Abstract:  We show that when $r \geq 5$ is prime, the SO(3) Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev quantum invariants for three-manifolds at the level $r$ form a dense set in the complex plane. This confirms a conjecture of Larsen and Wang. 
0808.02464	The New DAMA Dark-Matter Window and Energetic-Neutrino Searches	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Dan Hooper, Frank Petriello, Kathryn M. Zurek, Marc Kamionkowski	Abstract:  Recently, the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration has repeated and reinforced their claim to have detected an annual modulation in their signal rate, and have interpreted this observation as evidence for dark-matter particles at the 8.2 sigma confidence level. Furthermore, it has also been noted that the effects of channeling may enable a WIMP that scatters elastically via spin-independent interactions from nuclei to produce the signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA without exceeding the limits placed by CDMS, XENON, CRESST, CoGeNT and other direct-detection experiments. To accommodate this signal, however, the mass of the responsible dark-matter particle must be relatively light, m_{DM} \lsim 10 GeV. Such dark-matter particles will become captured by and annihilate in the Sun at very high rates, leading to a potentially large flux of GeV-scale neutrinos. We calculate the neutrino spectrum resulting from WIMP annihilations in the Sun and show that existing limits from Super-Kamiokande can be used to close a significant portion of the DAMA region, especially if the dark-matter particles produce tau leptons or neutrinos in a sizable fraction of their annihilations. We also determine the spin-dependent WIMP-nuclei elastic-scattering parameter space consistent with DAMA. The constraints from Super-Kamiokande on the spin-dependent scenario are even more severe--they exclude any self-annihilating WIMP in the DAMA region that annihilates 1% of the time or more to any combination of neutrinos, tau leptons, or charm or bottom quarks. 
0808.02465	Spitzer Observations of the z=2.73 Lensed Lyman Break Galaxy, MS1512-cB58	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Brian Siana (1), Harry I. Teplitz (2), Ranga-Ram Chary (2), James W. Colbert (2), David T. Frayer (3) ((1) Caltech, (2) Spitzer Science Center, (3) IPAC)    	Abstract:  We present Spitzer infrared (IR) photometry and spectroscopy of the lensed Lyman break galaxy (LBG), MS1512-cB58 at z=2.73. The large (factor ~30) magnification allows for the most detailed infrared study of an L*_UV(z=3) LBG to date. Broadband photometry with IRAC (3-10 micron), IRS (16 micron), and MIPS (24, 70 & 160 micron) was obtained as well as IRS spectroscopy spanning 5.5-35 microns. A fit of stellar population models to the optical/near-IR/IRAC photometry gives a young age (~9 Myr), forming stars at ~98 M_sun/yr, with a total stellar mass of ~10^9 M_sun formed thus far. The existence of an old stellar population with twice the stellar mass can not be ruled out. IR spectral energy distribution fits to the 24 and 70 micron photometry, as well as previously obtained submm/mm, data give an intrinsic IR luminosity L_IR = 1-2 x10^11 L_sun and a star formation rate, SFR ~20-40 M_sun/yr. The UV derived star formation rate (SFR) is ~3-5 times higher than the SFR determined using L_IR or L_Halpha because the red UV spectral slope is significantly over predicting the level of dust extinction. This suggests that the assumed Calzetti starburst obscuration law may not be valid for young LBGs. We detect strong line emission from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) at 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 microns. The line ratios are consistent with ratios observed in both local and high redshift starbursts. Both the PAH and rest-frame 8 micron luminosities predict the total L_IR based on previously measured relations in starbursts. Finally, we do not detect the 3.3 micron PAH feature. This is marginally inconsistent with some PAH emission models, but still consistent with PAH ratios measured in many local star-forming galaxies. 
0808.02466	Discovery of VHE gamma-rays from RGB J0152+017	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J.-P. Lenain, D. Nedbal, M. Raue, S. Kaufmann, L. Gérard, M. Hauser, B. Giebels, for the H.E.S.S. collaboration	Abstract:  The BL Lac object RGB J0152+017 (z = 0.080) was predicted to be a very high-energy (VHE; > 100 GeV) gamma-ray source, due to its high X-ray and radio fluxes. We report recent observations of this source made in late October and November 2007 with the H.E.S.S. array consisting of four imaging atmospheric Cerenkov telescopes. Contemporaneous observations were made in X-rays with the Swift and RXTE satellites, in the optical band with the ATOM telescope, and in the radio band with the Nancay Radio Telescope. As a result, RGB J0152+017 is discovered as a source of VHE gamma-rays by H.E.S.S. A signal of 173 gamma-ray photons corresponding to a statistical significance of 6.6 sigmas was found in the data. The energy spectrum of the source can be described by a powerlaw with a spectral index of = 2.95 +- 0.36stat +- 0.20syst. The integral flux above 300 GeV corresponds to ~2% of the flux of the Crab nebula. The source spectral energy distribution (SED) can be described using a two-component (extended jet and blob in jet) non-thermal synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) leptonic model, plus a thermal host galaxy component. The parameters that are found are very close to those found for TeV blazars in similar SSC studies. The location of its synchrotron peak, as derived from the SED in Swift data, allows clear classification as a high-frequency-peaked BL Lac (HBL). 
0808.02467	Energy conditions bounds and supernovae data	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M.P. Lima, S.D.P. Vitenti, M.J. Reboucas	Abstract:  The energy conditions play an important role in the description of some important properties of the Universe, including the current accelerating expansion phase and the possible recent phase of super-acceleration. In a recent work we have provided a detailed study of the energy conditions for the recent past by deriving bounds from energy conditions and by making the confrontation of the bounds with supernovae data. Here, we extend and update these results in two different ways. First, by carrying out a new statistical analysis for $q(z)$ estimates needed for the confrontation between the bounds and supernovae data. Second, by providing a new picture of the energy conditions fulfillment and violation in the light of the recently compiled Union set of 307 type Ia supernovae and by using two different statistical approaches. 
0808.02468	Distinguishing seesaw models at LHC with multi-lepton signals	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:F. del Aguila, J. A. Aguilar-Saavedra	Abstract:  We investigate the LHC discovery potential for electroweak scale heavy neutrino singlets (seesaw I), scalar triplets (seesaw II) and fermion triplets (seesaw III). For seesaw I we consider a heavy Majorana neutrino coupling to the electron or muon. For seesaw II we concentrate on the likely scenario where the new scalars decay to two leptons. For seesaw III we restrict ourselves to heavy Majorana fermion triplets decaying to light leptons plus gauge or Higgs bosons, which are dominant except for unnaturally small mixings. The possible signals are classified in terms of the charged lepton multiplicity, studying nine different final states ranging from one to six charged leptons. Using a fast detector simulation of signals and backgrounds, it is found that the trilepton channel l+- l+- l-+ is by far the best one for scalar triplet discovery, and for fermion triplets it is as good as the like-sign dilepton channel l+- l+-. For heavy neutrinos with a mass O(100) GeV, this trilepton channel is also better than the usually studied like-sign dilepton mode. In addition to evaluating the discovery potential, we make special emphasis on the discrimination among seesaw models if a positive signal is observed. This could be accomplished not only by searching for signals in different final states, but also by reconstructing the mass and determining the charge of the new resonances, which is possible in several cases. For high luminosities, further evidence is provided by the analysis of the production angular distributions in the cleanest channels with three or four leptons. 
0808.02469	MMT Hypervelocity Star Survey	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Warren R. Brown, Margaret J. Geller, Scott J. Kenyon (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory)    	Abstract:  We describe a new survey for unbound hypervelocity stars (HVSs), stars traveling with such extreme velocities that dynamical ejection from a massive black hole (MBH) is their most likely origin. We investigate the possible contribution of unbound runaway stars, and show that the physical properties of binaries constrain low mass runaways to bound velocities. We measure radial velocities for HVS candidates with the colors of early A-type and late B-type stars. We report the discovery of 6 unbound HVSs with velocities and distances exceeding the conservative escape velocity estimate of Kenyon and collaborators. We additionally report 4 possibly unbound HVSs with velocities and distances exceeding the lower escape velocity estimate of Xue and collaborators. These discoveries increase the number of known HVSs by 60%-100%. Other survey objects include 19 newly identified z~2.4 quasars. One of the HVSs may be a horizontal branch star, consistent with the number of evolved HVSs predicted by Galactic center ejection models. Finding more evolved HVSs will one day allow a probe of the low-mass regime of HVSs and will constrain the mass function of stars in the Galactic center. 
0808.02470	Measurements of CaII absorption, metals, and dust in a sample of z~1 DLAs and subDLAs	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Daniel Nestor, Max Pettini, Paul Hewett, Sandhya Rao, Vivienne Wild	Abstract:  We present observations of CaII, ZnII, and CrII absorption lines in 16 DLAs and 6 subDLAs at 0.6 < z < 1.3, obtained for the dual purposes of: (i) clarifying the relationship between DLAs and absorbers selected via strong CaII lines, and (ii) increasing the still limited sample of Zn and Cr abundances in this redshift range. We find only partial overlap between current samples of intermediate-z DLAs (which are drawn from magnitude limited surveys) and strong CaII absorbers: approximately 25% of known DLAs at these redshifts have an associated CaII 3935 line with REW>0.35A, the threshold of the SDSS sample assembled by Wild and her collaborators. The lack of the strongest systems (with REW>0.5A) is consistent with these authors' conclusion that such absorbers are often missed in current DLA surveys because they redden/dim the light of the background QSOs. We rule out the suggestion that strong CaII absorption is associated exclusively with the highest-N(HI) DLAs. Furthermore, we find no correlation between the strength of the CaII lines and either the metallicity or depletion, although the strongest CaII absorber in our sample is also the most metal-rich DLA yet discovered, with [Zn/H] ~ solar. We conclude that a complex mix of parameters determine the strengths of the CaII lines, including the density of particles and UV photons in the ISM of the galaxies hosting the DLAs. We find tentative evidence (given the small size of our sample) that strong CaII systems may preferentially sample regions of high gas density, perhaps akin to the DLAs exhibiting molecular hydrogen absorption at redshifts z>2. If this connection is confirmed, strong CaII absorbers would trace possibly metal-rich, H2-bearing columns of cool, dense gas at distances up to tens of kpc from normal galaxies. (abridged) 
0808.02471	Environmental Dependence of Dark Matter Halo Growth I: Halo Merger Rates	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Onsi Fakhouri, Chung-Pei Ma	Abstract:  In an earlier paper we quantified the mean merger rate of dark matter haloes as a function of redshift z, descendant halo mass M0, and progenitor halo mass ratio xi using the Millennium simulation of the LCDM cosmology. Here we broaden that study and investigate the dependence of the merger rate of haloes on their surrounding environment. A number of local mass overdensity variables, both including and excluding the halo mass itself, are tested as measures of a halo's environment. The simple functional dependence on z, M0, and xi of the merger rate found in our earlier work is largely preserved in different environments, but we find that the overall amplitude of the merger rate has a strong positive correlation with the environmental densities. For galaxy-mass haloes, we find mergers to occur ~2.5 times more frequently in the densest regions than in voids at both z=0 and higher redshifts. Higher-mass haloes show similar trends. We present a fitting form for this environmental dependence that is a function of both mass and local density and is valid out to z=2. The amplitude of the progenitor (or conditional) mass function shows a similarly strong correlation with local overdensity, suggesting that the extended Press-Schechter model for halo growth needs to be modified to incorporate environmental effects. 
0808.02472	A General Method for Model-Independent Measurements of Particle Spins, Couplings and Mixing Angles in Cascade Decays with Missing Energy at Hadron Colliders	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Michael Burns, Kyoungchul Kong, Konstantin T. Matchev, Myeonghun Park	Abstract:  We outline a general strategy for measuring spins, couplings and mixing angles in the case of a heavy partner decay chain terminating in an invisible particle. We consider the common example of a new scalar or fermion D decaying sequentially to other new particles C, B and A by emitting a quark jet j and two leptons ln and lf. We derive analytic formulas for the dilepton {ln,lf} and the two jet-lepton ({j,ln} and {j,lf}) invariant mass distributions for most general couplings and mixing angles of the new partners. We then consider various spin assignments for the particles A, B, C and D, and derive the relevant functional basis for the invariant mass distributions which contains the intrinsic spin information and does not depend on the couplings and mixing angles. We propose a new method for determining the spins of the new partners, using the three experimentally observable distributions {l+,l-}, {j,l+}+{j,l-} and {j,l+}-{j,l-}. We show that the former two only depend on a single model-dependent parameter alpha, while the latter may depend on two other parameters beta and gamma. By fitting these distributions to our set of basis functions, we are able to do a pure measurement of the spins per se. Our method is also applicable at a pp-bar collider such as the Tevatron, for which the previously proposed lepton charge asymmetry is identically zero and does not contain any spin information. In the process of determining the spins, we also obtain an independent measurement of the parameters alpha, beta and gamma, which represent certain combinations of the couplings and the mixing angles of the heavy partners A, B, C and D. 
0808.02473	Non-linear theory for multiple M2 branes	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Roberto Iengo, Jorge G. Russo	Abstract:  We present a manifestly SO(8) invariant non-linear Lagrangian for describing the non-abelian dynamics of the bosonic degrees of freedom of N coinciding M2 branes in flat spacetime. The theory exhibits a gauge symmetry structure of the BF type (semidirect product of SU(N) and translations) and at low energies it reduces exactly to the bosonic part of the Lorentzian Bagger-Lambert Lagrangian for group SU(N). There are eight scalar fields satisfying a free-scalar equation. When one of them takes a large expectation value, the non-linear Lagrangian gets simplified and the theory can be connected to the non-abelian Lagrangian describing the dynamics of N coinciding D2 branes. As an application, we show that the BPS fuzzy funnel solution describing M2 branes ending into a single M5 brane is an exact solution of the non-linear system. 
0808.02474	Making Almost Commuting Matrices Commute	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:M. B. Hastings	Abstract:  Suppose two Hermitian matrices $A,B$ almost commute ($\Vert [A,B] \Vert \leq δ$). Are they close to a commuting pair of Hermitian matrices, $A',B'$, with $\Vert A-A' \Vert,\Vert B-B'\Vert \leq ε$? A theorem of H. Lin shows that this is uniformly true, in that for every $ε>0$ there exists a $δ>0$, independent of the size $N$ of the matrices, for which almost commuting implies being close to a commuting pair. However, this theorem does not specify how $δ$ depends on $ε$. We give uniform bounds relating $δ$ and $ε$. We provide tighter bounds in the case of block tridiagonal and tridiagonal matrices and a fully constructive method in that case. Within the context of quantum measurement, this implies an algorithm to construct a basis in which we can make a {\it projective} measurement that approximately measures two approximately commuting operators simultaneously. Finally, we comment briefly on the case of approximately measuring three or more approximately commuting operators using POVMs (positive operator-valued measures) instead of projective measurements. 
0808.02475	All tree-level amplitudes in N=4 SYM	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:J. M. Drummond, J. M. Henn	Abstract:  We give an explicit formula for all tree amplitudes in N=4 SYM, derived by solving the recently presented supersymmetric tree-level recursion relations. The result is given in a compact, manifestly supersymmetric form and we show how to extract from it all possible component amplitudes for an arbitrary number of external particles and any arrangement of external particles and helicities. We focus particularly on extracting gluon amplitudes which are valid for any gauge theory. The formula for all tree-level amplitudes is given in terms of nested sums of dual superconformal invariants and it therefore manifestly respects both conventional and dual superconformal symmetry. 
0808.02476	Algebraic points of small height missing a union of varieties	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Lenny Fukshansky	Abstract:  Let $K$ be a number field, $\overline{\mathbb Q}$, or the field of rational functions on a smooth projective curve over a perfect field, and let $V$ be a subspace of $K^N$, $N \geq 2$. Let $Z_K$ be a union of varieties defined over $K$ such that $V \nsubseteq Z_K$. We prove the existence of a point of small height in $V \setminus Z_K$, providing an explicit upper bound on the height of such a point in terms of the height of $V$ and the degree of a hypersurface containing $Z_K$, where dependence on both is optimal. This generalizes and improves upon the previous results of the author. As a part of our argument, we provide a basic extension of the function field version of Siegel's lemma of J. Thunder to an inequality with inhomogeneous heights. As a corollary of the method, we derive an explicit lower bound for the number of algebraic integers of bounded height in a fixed number field. 
0808.02477	Ionizing Photon Escape Fractions from High Redshift Dwarf Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:John H. Wise (NASA/GSFC), Renyue Cen (Princeton)    	Abstract:  It has been argued that low-luminosity dwarf galaxies are the dominant source of ionizing radiation during cosmological reionization. The fraction of ionizing radiation that escapes into the intergalactic medium from dwarf galaxies with masses less than ~10^9.5 solar masses plays a critical role during this epoch. Using an extensive suite of very high resolution (0.1 pc), adaptive mesh refinement, radiation hydrodynamical simulations of idealized and cosmological dwarf galaxies, we characterize the behavior of the escape fraction in galaxies between 3 x 10^6 and 3 x 10^9 solar masses with different spin parameters, amounts of turbulence, and baryon mass fractions. For a given halo mass, escape fractions can vary up to a factor of two, depending on the initial setup of the idealized halo. In a cosmological setting, we find that the time-averaged photon escape fraction always exceeds 25% and reaches up to 80% in halos with masses above 10^8 solar masses with a top-heavy IMF. The instantaneous escape fraction can vary up to an order of magnitude in a few million years and tend to be positively correlated with star formation rate. We find that the mean of the star formation efficiency times ionizing photon escape fraction, averaged over all atomic cooling (T_vir > 8000 K) galaxies, ranges from 0.02 for a normal IMF to 0.03 for a top-heavy IMF, whereas smaller, molecular cooling galaxies in minihalos do not make a significant contribution to reionizing the universe due to a much lower star formation efficiency. These results provide the physical basis for cosmological reionization by stellar sources, predominately atomic cooling dwarf galaxies. 
0808.02478	On the behavior of bosonic systems in the presence of topology fluctuations	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:A.A. Kirillov, E.P. Savelova	Abstract:  The behavior of bosonic systems in the presence of space-time foam is analyzed within the simplistic model of a set of scalar fields on a flat background. We discuss the formula for the path integral which allows to account for the all possible topologies of spacetime. We show that the proper path integral originates from the parastatistics suggested first by H.S. Green and that it defines a cutoff for the field theory. 
0808.02479	Relaxed commutant lifting: existence of a unique solution	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:S. ter Horst	Abstract:  In this paper we present necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a unique solution to the relaxed commutant lifting problem. The obtained conditions are more complicated than those for the classical commutant lifting setting, and earlier obtained sufficient conditions turn out not to be necessary conditions. It is also shown that these conditions simplify in certain special cases. 
0808.02480	Chemical Analysis of Five Red Giants in the Globular Cluster M10 (NGC 6254)	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Sharina Haynes, Geoffrey Burks, Christian I. Johnson, Catherine A. Pilachowski	Abstract:  We have determined Al, $α$, Fe-peak, and neutron capture elemental abundances for five red giant branch (RGB) stars in the Galactic globular cluster M10. Abundances were determined using equivalent width analyses of moderate resolution (R$\sim$15,000) spectra obtained with the Hydra multifiber positioner and bench spectrograph on the WIYN telescope. The data sample the upper RGB from the luminosity level near the horizontal branch to about 0.5 mag below the RGB tip. We find in agreement with previous studies that M10 is moderately metal-poor with [Fe/H]=-1.45 ($σ$=0.04). All stars appear enhanced in Al with $<$[Al/Fe]$>$=+0.33 ($σ$=0.19), but no stars have [Al/Fe]$\ga$+0.55. We find the $α$ elements to be enhanced by +0.20 to +0.40 dex and the Fe--peak elements to have [el/Fe]$\sim$0, which are consistent with predictions from type II SN ejecta. Additionally, the cluster appears to be r-process rich with $<$[Eu/La]$>$=+0.41. 
0808.02481	AdS Wormholes	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:A. Bergman, H. Lu, Jianwei Mei, C.N. Pope	Abstract:  We obtain a large class of smooth Lorentzian p-brane wormholes in supergravities in various dimensions. They connect two asymptotically flat spacetimes. In cases where there is no dilaton involved in the solution, the wormhole can connect an AdS_n\times S^m in one asymptotic region to a flat spacetime in the other. We obtain explicit examples for (n,m)=(4,7), (7,4), (5,5), (3,3), (3,2). These geometries correspond to field theories with UV conformal fixed points, and they undergo decompactification in the IR region. In the case of AdS_3, we compute the central charge of the corresponding conformal field theory.

A. Vinogradov for the bounded Toeplitz operators on the space of functions analytic and bounded in the unit disc is given. 
0808.02483	Correlated Variability in Blazars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Robert Wagner (Max-Planck-Institut f\"ur Physik, Munich and Excellence Cluster Universe, Garching)    	Abstract:  Blazars are thought to emit highly-collimated outflows, so-called jets. By their close alignment to our line of sight, relativistic beaming effects enable us to observe these jets over the whole electromagnetic spectrum up to TeV energies, making them ideal laboratories for studying jet physics. In the last years multiwavelength observations of blazars provided us with detailed data sets which helped to characterize the two main components of the non-relativistic emission, peaking in the optical to X-ray and GeV/TeV energy region, respectively. In leptonic acceleration models, they are explained by synchrotron radiation of electrons and inverse-Compton emission from the same electron population and thus, correlations of both emission regimes are expected. We review recent observational results on the presence and absence of such correlations in blazars, and discuss constraints on emission models by quantitative correlation analyses. 
0808.02484	Non-Hermitian delocalization and the extinction transition	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:David A. Kessler, Nadav M. Shnerb	Abstract:  Logistic growth on a static heterogenous substrate is studied both above and below the drift-induced delocalization transition. Using stochastic, agent-based simulations the delocalization of the highest eigenfunction is connected with the large $N$ limit of the stochastic theory, as the localization length of the deterministic theory controls the divergence of the spatial correlation length at the transition. Any finite colony made of discrete agents is washed away from a heterogeneity with compact support in the presence of strong wind, thus the transition belongs to the directed percolation universality class. Some of the difficulties in the analysis of the extinction transition in the presence of a localized active state are discussed. 
0808.02485	On Yang-Mills Theories with Chiral Matter at Strong Coupling	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:M. Shifman, Mithat Unsal	Abstract:  Strong coupling dynamics of Yang--Mills theories with chiral fermion content remained largely elusive despite much effort over the years. In this work, we propose a dynamical framework in which we can address non-perturbative properties of chiral, non-supersymmetric gauge theories, in particular, chiral quiver theories on $S_1 \times R_3 $. Double-trace deformations are used to stabilize the center-symmetric vacuum. This allows one to smoothly connect small-$r(S_1)$ to large-$r(S_1)$ physics ($R_4$ is the limiting case) where the double-trace deformations are switched off. In particular, occurrence of the mass gap in the gauge sector and linear confinement due to bions are analytically demonstrated. We find the pattern of the chiral symmetry realization which depends on the structure of the ring operators, a novel class of topological excitations. The deformed chiral theory, unlike the undeformed one, satisfies volume independence down to arbitrarily small volumes (a working Eguchi--Kawai reduction) in the large $N$ limit. This equivalence, may open new perspectives on strong coupling chiral gauge theories on $R_4$. 
0808.02486	Wet Paper Coding for Watermarking of Binary Images	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Michail Zubarev, Valery Korzhik, Guillermo Morales-Luna	Abstract:  We propose a new method to embed data in binary images, including scanned text, figures, and signatures. Our method relies on the concept of wet paper codes. The shuffling before embedding is used in order to equalize irregular embedding capacity from diverse areas in the image. The hidden data can be extracted without the original binary image. We illustrate some examples of watermarked binary images after wet paper coding. 
0808.02487	Commuting-Square Subfactors and Central Sequences	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Richard Burstein	Abstract:  Let $M_0 \subset M_1$ be a finite-index infinite-depth hyperfinite $II_1$ subfactor and $ω$ a free ultrafilter of the natural numbers. We show that if this subfactor is constructed from a commuting square then the central sequence inclusion $M_0^ω \cap M_1' \subset (M_0)_ω$ has infinite Pimnser-Popa index. We will also demonstrate this result for certain infinite-depth hyperfinite subfactors coming from groups. 
0808.02488	A Basic Thermodynamic Derivation of the Maximum Overburden Pressure Generated in Frost Heave	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Kenneth G. Libbrecht	Abstract:  I describe a simple heat-engine derivation of the maximum overburden pressure that can be generated in frost heave. The method stems from the fact that useful work can, in principle, be extracted from the forces generated by an advancing solidification front via the frost heave mechanism. Using an idealized frost heave engine, together with the maximum thermodynamic efficiency of any heat engine, one can derive the maximum overburden pressure. A similar argument can also produce the maximum thermodynamic buoyancy force on a foreign object within a solid surrounded by a premelted layer. 
0808.02489	On S-Matrix factorization of the Landau-Lifshitz model	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:A. Melikyan, A. Pinzul, V. O. Rivelles, G. Weber	Abstract:  We consider the three-particle scattering S-matrix for the Landau-Lifshitz model by directly computing the set of the Feynman diagrams up to the second order. We show, following the analogous computations for the non-linear Schrödinger model, that the three-particle S-matrix is factorizable in the first non-trivial order. 
0808.02490	Evolution of a population of random Boolean networks	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:Tamara Mihaljev, Barbara Drossel	Abstract:  We investigate the evolution of populations of random Boolean networks under selection for robustness of the dynamics with respect to the perturbation of the state of a node. The fitness landscape contains a huge plateau of maximum fitness that spans the entire network space. When selection is so strong that it dominates over drift, the evolutionary process is accompanied by a slow increase in the mean connectivity and a slow decrease in the mean fitness. Populations evolved with higher mutation rates show a higher robustness under mutations. This means that even though all the evolved populations exist close to the plateau of maximum fitness, they end up in different regions of network space. 
0808.02491	The Dynamics of the One-Dimensional Delta-Function Bose Gas	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Craig A. Tracy, Harold Widom	Abstract:  We give a method to solve the time-dependent Schroedinger equation for a system of one-dimensional bosons interacting via a repulsive delta function potential. The method uses the ideas of Bethe Ansatz but does not use the spectral theory of the associated Hamiltonian. 
0808.02492	Faranoff-Riley type I jet deceleration at density discontinuities "Relativistic hydrodynamics with realistic equation of state"	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Z. Meliani, R. Keppens, B. Giacomazzo	Abstract:  The deceleration mechanisms for relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei remain an open question, and in this paper we propose a model which could explain sudden jet deceleration, invoking density discontinuities. This is particularly motivated by recent indications from HYMORS. Exploiting high resolution, numerical simulations, we demonstrate that for both high and low energy jets, always at high Lorentz factor, a transition to a higher density environment can cause a significant fraction of the directed jet energy to be lost on reflection. This can explain how one-sided jet deceleration and a transition to FR I type can occur in HYMORS, which start as FR II (and remain so on the other side). For that purpose, we implemented in the relativistic hydrodynamic grid-adaptive AMRVAC code, the Synge-type equation of state introduced in the general polytropic case by Meliani et al. (2004). We present results for 10 model computations, varying the inlet Lorentz factor from 10 to 20, including uniform or decreasing density profiles, and allowing for cylindrical versus conical jet models. As long as the jet propagates through uniform media, we find that the density contrast sets most of the propagation characteristics, fully consistent with previous modeling efforts. When the jet runs into a denser medium, we find a clear distinction in the decelaration of high energy jets depending on the encountered density jump. For fairly high density contrast, the jet becomes destabilised and compressed, decelerates strongly (up to subrelativistic speeds) and can form knots. We point out differences that are found between cylindrical and conical jet models, together with dynamical details like the Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities developing at the original contact interface. 
0808.02493	Galaxy density profiles and shapes -- I. simulation pipeline for lensing by realistic galaxy models	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Glenn van de Ven (IAS, Princeton), Rachel Mandelbaum (IAS, Princeton), Charles R. Keeton (Rutgers Univ.)    	Abstract:  Studies of strong gravitational lensing in current and upcoming wide and deep photometric surveys, and of stellar kinematics from (integral-field) spectroscopy at increasing redshifts, promise to provide valuable constraints on galaxy density profiles and shapes. However, both methods are affected by various selection and modelling biases, whch we aim to investigate in a consistent way. In this first paper in a series we develop a flexible but efficient pipeline to simulate lensing by realistic galaxy models. These galaxy models have separate stellar and dark matter components, each with a range of density profiles and shapes representative of early-type, central galaxies without significant contributions from other nearby galaxies. We use Fourier methods to calculate the lensing properties of galaxies with arbitrary surface density distributions, and Monte Carlo methods to compute lensing statistics such as point-source lensing cross-sections. Incorporating a variety of magnification bias modes lets us examine different survey limitations in image resolution and flux. We rigorously test the numerical methods for systematic errors and sensitivity to basic assumptions. We also determine the minimum number of viewing angles that must be sampled in order to recover accurate orientation-averaged lensing quantities. We find that for a range of non-isothermal stellar and dark matter density profiles typical of elliptical galaxies, the combined density profile and corresponding lensing properties are surprisingly close to isothermal around the Einstein radius. The converse implication is that constraints from strong lensing and/or stellar kinematics, which are indeed consistent with isothermal models near the Einstein radius, cannot trivially be extrapolated to smaller and larger radii. 
0808.02494	Orientational order in two dimensions from competing interactions at different scales	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Daniel G. Barci, Daniel A. Stariolo	Abstract:  We discuss orientational order in two dimensions in the context of systems with competing isotropic interactions at different scales. We consider an extension of the Brazovskii model for stripe phases including explicitly quartic terms with nematic symmetry in the energy. We show that leading fluctuations of the mean field nematic solution drive the isotropic-nematic transition into the Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class, i.e. these systems have a thermodynamic phase with orientational quasi-long-range order. 
0808.02495	Lieb-Robinson bounds and the speed of light from topological order	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Alioscia Hamma, Fotini Markopoulou, Isabeau Premont-Schwarz, Simone Severini	Abstract:  We apply the Lieb-Robinson bounds technique to find the maximum speed of interaction in a spin model with topological order whose low-energy effective theory describes light [see X.-G. Wen, \prb {\bf 68}, 115413 (2003)]. The maximum speed of interactions is found in two dimensions is bounded from above less than $\sqrt{2} e$ times the speed of emerging light, giving a strong indication that light is indeed the maximum speed of interactions. This result does not rely on mean field theoretic methods. In higher spatial dimensions, the Lieb-Robinson speed is conjectured to increase linearly with the dimension itself. Implications for the horizon problem in cosmology are discussed. 
0808.02496	Rotations in the Space of Split Octonions	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Merab Gogberashvili	Abstract:  The geometrical application of split octonions is considered. The modified Fano graphic, which represents products of the basis units of split octonionic, having David's Star shape, is presented. It is shown that active and passive transformations of coordinates in octonionic '8-space' are not equivalent. The group of passive transformations that leave invariant the norm of split octonions is SO(4,4), while active rotations is done by the direct product of O(3,4)-boosts and real non-compact form of the exceptional group $G_2$. In classical limit these transformations reduce to the standard Lorentz group. 
0808.02497	Galaxy density profiles and shapes -- II. selection biases in strong lensing surveys	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Rachel Mandelbaum (IAS, Princeton), Glenn van de Ven (IAS, Princeton), Charles R. Keeton (Rutgers Univ.)    	Abstract:  [Abridged] Many current and future astronomical surveys will rely on samples of strong gravitational lens systems to draw conclusions about galaxy mass distributions. We use a new strong lensing pipeline (presented in Paper I of this series) to explore selection biases that may cause the population of strong lensing systems to differ from the general galaxy population. Our focus is on point-source lensing by early-type galaxies with two mass components (stellar and dark matter) that have a variety of density profiles and shapes motivated by observational and theoretical studies of galaxy properties. We seek not only to quantify but also to understand the physics behind selection biases related to: galaxy mass, orientation and shape; dark matter profile parameters such as inner slope and concentration; and adiabatic contraction. We study how all of these properties affect the lensing Einstein radius, total cross-section, quad/double ratio, and image separation distribution. We find significant (factors of several) selection biases with mass; orientation, for a given galaxy shape at fixed mass; cusped dark matter profile inner slope and concentration; concentration of the stellar and dark matter deprojected Sersic models. Interestingly, the intrinsic shape of a galaxy does not strongly influence its lensing cross-section when we average over viewing angles. Our results are an important first step towards understanding how strong lens systems relate to the general galaxy population. 
0808.02498	Vortex avalanches in the non-centrosymmetric superconductor Li2Pt3B	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:C. F. Miclea, A. C. Mota, M. Sigrist, F. Steglich, T. A. Sayles, B. J. Taylor, C. McElroy, M. B. Maple	Abstract:  We investigated the vortex dynamics in the non-centrosymmetric superconductor Li_2Pt_3B in the temperature range 0.1 K - 2.8 K. Two different logarithmic creep regimes in the decay of the remanent magnetization from the Bean critical state have been observed. In the first regime, the creep rate is extraordinarily small, indicating the existence of a new, very effective pinning mechanism. At a certain time a vortex avalanche occurs that increases the logarithmic creep rate by a factor of about 5 to 10 depending on the temperature. This may indicate that certain barriers against flux motion are present and they can be opened under increased pressure exerted by the vortices. A possible mechanism based on the barrier effect of twin boundaries is briefly discussed. 
0808.02499	Improved lower bound on the size of Kakeya sets over finite fields	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Shubhangi Saraf, Madhu Sudan	Abstract:  In a recent breakthrough, Dvir showed that every Kakeya set in $\F^n$ must be of cardinality at least $c_n |\F|^n$ where $c_n \approx 1/n!$. We improve this lower bound to $β^n |\F|^n$ for a constant $β> 0$. This pins down the growth of the leading constant to the right form as a function of $n$. 
0808.02500	Field Re-entrant Superconductivity Induced by the Enhancement of Effective Mass in URhGe	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Atsushi Miyake, Dai Aoki, Jacques Flouquet	Abstract:  High quality single crystals of a ferromagnetic superconductor URhGe were successfully grown. The electrical resistivity was measured for the field along b-axis in the orthorhombic crystal structure in order to study precisely its field re-entrant superconductivity which occurs in the vicinity of the field $H_{\rm R}$, where the easy magnetization switches from $c$ to b-axis. The field re-entrant superconductivity of URhGe is analyzed with special focus on its dependence with the value of residual resistivity $ρ_0$ and the coefficient $A$ of $T^2$ term of the resistivity. The experimental results are well explained by a crude model related with the field dependence of the effective mass $m^\ast$, where the corresponding critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{sc}}(m^\ast)$ and the upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$ are strongly enhanced. Discussion is made on the interplay between magnetic and superconducting phase diagram as well as the link between $T_{\mathrm{sc}}$ and $A$ in other heavy fermion superconductors. 
0808.02501	Extending Hudson's theorem to mixed quantum states	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:A. Mandilara, E. Karpov, N. J. Cerf	Abstract:  According to Hudson's theorem, any pure quantum state with a positive Wigner function is necessarily a Gaussian state. Here, we make a step towards the extension of this theorem to mixed quantum states by finding upper and lower bounds on the degree of non-Gaussianity of states with positive Wigner functions. The bounds are expressed in the form of parametric functions relating the degree of non-Gaussianity of a state, its purity, and the purity of the Gaussian state characterized by the same covariance matrix. Although our bounds are not tight, they permit us to visualize the set of states with positive Wigner functions. 
0808.02502	The Conjugacy Problem in the Grigorchuk Group is polynomial time decidable	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:I. Lysenok, A. Myasnikov, A. Ushakov	Abstract:  In this paper we prove that the Conjugacy Problem in the Grigorchuk group $Γ$ has polynomial time complexity. 
0808.02503	Three-dimensional N=6 SCFT's and their membrane dynamics	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:David Berenstein, Diego Trancanelli	Abstract:  We analyze several aspects of the recent construction of three-dimensional conformal gauge theories by Aharony et al. in various regimes. We pay special attention to understanding how the M-theory geometry and interpretation can be extracted from the analysis of the field theory. We revisit the calculations of the moduli space of vacua and the complete characterization of chiral ring operators by analyzing the field theory compactified on a 2-sphere. We show that many of the states dual to these operators can be interpreted as D-brane states in the weak coupling limit. Also, various features of the dual AdS geometry can be obtained by performing a strong coupling expansion around moduli space configurations, even though one is not taking the planar expansion. In particular, we show that at strong coupling the corresponding weak coupling D-brane states of the chiral ring localize on particular submanifolds of the dual geometry that match the M-theory interpretation. We also study the massive spectrum of fields in the moduli space. We use this to investigate the dispersion relation of giant magnons from the field theory point of view. Our analysis predicts the exact functional form of the dispersion relation as a function of the world-sheet momentum, independently of integrability assumptions, but not the exact form with respect to the 't Hooft coupling. We also get the dispersion relation of bound states of giant magnons from first principles, providing evidence for the full integrability of the corresponding spin chain model at strong 't Hooft coupling. 
0808.02504	Non-Gaussian continuous-variable teleportation	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Paulina Marian, Tudor A. Marian	Abstract:  We have recently shown that the output field in the Braunstein-Kimble protocol of teleportation is a superposition of two fields: the input one and a field created by Alice's measurement and by displacement of the state at Bob's station by using the classical information provided by Alice. We study here the noise added by teleportation and compare its influence in the Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings. 
0808.02505	Heavy element abundances in giant stars of the globular clusters M4 and M5	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:David Yong (1), Amanda I. Karakas (1), David L. Lambert (2), Alessandro Chieffi (3), Marco Limongi (4) ((1) RSAA, Mt Stromlo Observatory, (2) Univ. of Texas, (3) INAF-IASF, (4) INAF-OAR)    	Abstract:  We present a comprehensive abundance analysis of 27 heavy elements in bright giant stars of the globular clusters M4 and M5 based on high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with the Magellan Clay Telescope. We confirm and expand upon previous results for these clusters by showing that (1) all elements heavier than, and including, Si have constant abundances within each cluster, (2) the elements from Ca to Ni have indistinguishable compositions in M4 and M5, (3) Si, Cu, Zn, and all s-process elements are approximately 0.3 dex overabundant in M4 relative to M5, and (4) the r-process elements Sm, Eu, Gd, and Th are slightly overabundant in M5 relative to M4. The cluster-to-cluster abundance differences for Cu and Zn are intriguing, especially in light of their uncertain nucleosynthetic origins. We confirm that stars other than Type Ia supernovae must produce significant amounts of Cu and Zn at or below the clusters' metallicities. If intermediate-mass AGB stars or massive stars are responsible for the Cu and Zn enhancements in M4, the similar [Rb/Zr] ratios and (preliminary) Mg isotope ratios in both clusters may be problematic for either scenario. For the elements from Ba to Hf, we assume that the s- and r-process contributions are scaled versions of the solar s- and r-process abundances. We quantify the relative fractions of s- and r-process material for each cluster and show that they provide an excellent fit to the observed abundances. 
0808.02506	Telescopes versus Microscopes: the puzzle of Iron-60	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jonathan P. Williams	Abstract:  The discovery that the short-lived radionucleide iron-60 was present in the oldest meteorites suggests that the formation of the Earth closely followed the death of a massive star. I discuss three astrophysical origins: winds from an AGB star, injection of supernova ejecta into circumstellar disks, and induced star formation on the boundaries of HII regions. I show that the first two fail to match the solar system iron-60 abundance in the vast majority of star forming systems. The cores and pillars on the edges of HII regions are spectacular but rare sites of star formation and larger clumps with masses 1e3-1e4 solar masses at tens of parsec from a supernova are a more likely birth environment for our Sun. I also examine gamma-ray observations of iron-60 decay and show that the Galactic background could account for the low end of the range of meteoritic measurements if the massive star formation rate was at least a factor of 2 higher 4.6 Gyr ago. 
0808.02507	Remarks on Chern-Simons Theory	Algebraic Topology (math.AT)	Authors:Daniel S. Freed	Abstract:  In the late 1980s Witten used the Chern-Simons form of a connection to construct new invariants of 3-manifolds and knots, recovering in particular the Jones invariants. Since then the associated topological quantum field theory (TQFT) has served as a key example in understanding the structure of TQFTs in general. We survey some of that structure with a particular focus on the "multi-tier" aspects. We discuss general axioms, generators-and-relations theorems, a priori constructions, dimensional reduction and K-theory, and Chern-Simons as a 0-1-2-3 theory. An appendix gives a lightening treatment of the Chern-Simons-Weil theory of connections. The paper concludes with general remarks about the Geometry-QFT-Strings interaction. 
0808.02508	Infrared behaviour of the fermion propagator in unquenched QED$_3$ with finite threshold effects	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Yuichi Hoshino	Abstract:  To remove the linear infrared divergences in quenched approximation we include the massive fermion loop to the photon spectral function.Spectral function of fermion has no one particle singularity if we fix the anomalous dimension to be unity.In the case of $N$ flavour,$N$ dependence of order parameter is mild which may be due to screening effects. 
0808.02509	A light CP-odd Higgs boson and the muon anomalous magnetic moment	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:John F. Gunion	Abstract:  We amalgamate the many experimental limits on the $ab\anti b$ coupling of a light CP-odd Higgs boson, $a$, including model-dependence coming from the ratio of the $at\anti t$ to the $a b\anti b$ coupling. We then employ these limits to analyze the extent to which a light $a$ can make a significant contribution to the discrepancy, $Δa_μ$, between the experimentally observed $a_μ$ and that predicted by the standard model. In a "model-independent" framework and in the context of a general two-Higgs-doublet model this is a significant possibility. In contrast, the minimal supersymmetric model is too strongly constrained (after combining experimental and theoretical input) to allow a CP-odd-$a$ explanation of $Δa_μ$. The next-to-minimal supersymmetric model allows more freedom and the light $a$ of the model could explain the full $Δa_μ$ if $9.2\gev<\ma<12\gev $, or contribute substantially for larger $\ma$, if $\tanb$ is large. 
0808.02510	Post-Newtonian Approximation in Maxwell-Like Form	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Jeffrey D. Kaplan, David A. Nichols, Kip S. Thorne	Abstract:  The equations of the linearized first post-Newtonian approximation to general relativity are often written in "gravitoelectromagnetic" Maxwell-like form, since that facilitates physical intuition. Damour, Soffel and Xu (DSX) (as a side issue in their complex but elegant papers on relativistic celestial mechanics) have expressed the first post-Newtonian approximation, including all nonlinearities, in Maxwell-like form. This paper summarizes that DSX Maxwell-like formalism (which is not easily extracted from their celestial mechanics papers), and then extends it to include the post-Newtonian (Landau-Lifshitz-based) gravitational momentum density, momentum flux (i.e. gravitational stress tensor) and law of momentum conservation in Maxwell-like form. The authors and their colleagues have found these Maxwell-like momentum tools useful for developing physical intuition into numerical-relativity simulations of compact binaries with spin. 
0808.02511	Adsorbate-limited conductivity of graphene	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:John P. Robinson, Henning Schomerus, Laszlo Oroszlany, Vladimir I. Fal'ko	Abstract:  We present a theory of electronic transport in graphene in the presence of randomly placed adsorbates. Our analysis predicts a marked asymmetry of the conductivity about the Dirac point, as well as a negative weak-localization magnetoresistivity. In the region of strong scattering, renormalization group corrections drive the system further towards insulating behavior. These results explain key features of recent experiments, and are validated by numerical transport computations. 
0808.02512	Study of highly-excited string states at the Large Hadron Collider	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Douglas M. Gingrich, Kevin Martell	Abstract:  In TeV-scale gravity scenarios with large extra dimensions, black holes may be produced at future colliders. Good arguments have been made for why general relativistic black holes may be just out of reach of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, in weakly-coupled string theory, highly excited string states - string balls - could be produced at the LHC with high rates and decay thermally, not unlike general relativistic black holes. In this paper, we simulate and study string ball production and decay at the LHC. We specifically emphasize the experimentally-detectable similarities and differences between string balls and general relativistic black holes at a TeV scale. 
0808.02513	Noise-Sustained Convective Instability in a Magnetized Taylor-Couette Flow	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Wei Liu	Abstract:  The helical magnetorotational instability of the magnetized Taylor-Couette flow is studied numerically in a finite cylinder. A distant upstream insulating boundary is shown to stabilize the convective instability entirely while reducing the growth rate of the absolute instability. The reduction is less severe with larger height. After modeling the boundary conditions properly, the wave patterns observed in the experiment turn out to be a noise-sustained convective instability. After the source of the noise resulted from unstable Ekman and Stewartson layers is switched off, a slowly-decaying inertial oscillation is observed in the simulation. We reach the conclusion that the experiments completed to date have not yet reached the regime of absolute instability. 
0808.02514	Noise-based communication and computing	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:Laszlo B. Kish	Abstract:  We discuss the speed-error-heat triangle and related problems with rapidly increasing energy dissipation and error rate during miniaturization. These and the independently growing need of unconditional data security have provoked non-conventional approaches in the physics of informatics. Noise-based informatics is a potentially promising possibility which is the way how biological brains process the information. Recently, it has been shown that thermal noise and its electronically enhanced versions (Johnson-like noises) can be utilized as information carrier with peculiar properties. Relevant examples are Zero power (stealth) communication, Unconditionally secure communication with Johnson(-like) noise and Kirchhoff loop and Noise-driven computing. The zero power communication utilizes the equilibrium background noise in the channel to transfer information. The unconditionally secure communication is based on the properties of Johnson(-like) noise and those of a simple Kirchhoff's loop. The scheme utilizes on the robustness of classical information and the second law of thermodynamics. It uncovers active eavesdropping within a single clock period (no error statistics is required) and it is naturally protected against the man-in-the-middle attack. Further advantages of the scheme is that the circuitry can easily be integrated on computer chips, unconditionally secure computer processors, memories and other hardware can be realized. 
0808.02515	Provably efficient instanton search algorithm for LP decoding of LDPC codes over the BSC	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Shashi Kiran Chilappagari, Michael Chertkov, Bane Vasic	Abstract:  We consider Linear Programming (LP) decoding of a fixed Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) code over the Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). The LP decoder fails when it outputs a pseudo-codeword which is not a codeword. We design an efficient algorithm termed the Instanton Search Algorithm (ISA) which, given a random input, generates a set of flips called the BSC-instanton. We prove that: (a) the LP decoder fails for any set of flips with support vector including an instanton; (b) for any input, the algorithm outputs an instanton in the number of steps upper-bounded by twice the number of flips in the input. Repeated sufficient number of times, the ISA outcomes the number of unique instantons of different sizes. 
0808.02516	Transmission probabilities and the Miller-Good transformation	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Petarpa Boonserm (Victoria University of Wellington), Matt Visser (Victoria University of Wellington)    	Abstract:  Transmission through a potential barrier, and the related issue of particle production from a parametric resonance, are topics of considerable general interest in quantum physics. The authors have developed a rather general bound on quantum transmission probabilities, and recently applied it to bounding the greybody factors of a Schwarzschild black hole. In the current article we take a different tack -- we use the Miller-Good transformation (which maps an initial Schrodinger equation to a final Schrodinger equation for a different potential) to significantly generalize the previous bound. 
0808.02517	Why it has become more difficult to predict Nobel Prize winners: a bibliometric analysis of Nominees and Winners of the Chemistry and Physics Prizes (1901-2007)	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:Yves Gingras, Matthew L. Wallace	Abstract:  We propose a comprehensive bibliometric study of the profile of Nobel prizewinners in chemistry and physics from 1901 to 2007, based on citation data available over the same period. The data allows us to observe the evolution of the profiles of winners in the years leading up to (and following) nominations and awarding of the Nobel Prize. The degree centrality and citation rankings in these fields confirm that the Prize is awarded at the peak of the winners' careers, despite brief a Halo Effect observable in the years following the attribution of the Prize. Changes in the size and organization of the two fields result in a rapid decline of predictive power of bibliometric data over the century. This can be explained not only by the growing size and fragmentation of the two disciplines, but also, at least in the case of physics, by an implicit hierarchy in the most legitimate topics within the discipline, as well as among the scientists selected for the Prize. Furthermore, the lack of readily-identifiable dominant contemporary physicists suggests that there are few new paradigm shifts within the field, as perceived by the scientific community as a whole. 
0808.02518	Comment on "Black hole constraints on varying fundamental constants"	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:V.V. Flambaum	Abstract:  In the Letter [1] (also [2]) there is a claim that the generalised second law of thermodynamics (entropy increase) for black holes provides some limits on the rate of variation of the fundamental constants of nature (electric charge e, speed of light c, etc.). We have come to a different conclusion. The results in [1,2] are based on assumption that mass of a black hole does not change without radiation and accreation. We present arguments showing that this assumption is incorrect and give an estimate of the black hole mass variation due to alpha=e^2/\hbar c variation using entropy (and quantum energy level) conservation in an adiabatic process. No model-independent limits on the variation of the fundamental constants are derived from the second law of thermodynamics. 
0808.02519	The B -> D* l nu form factor at zero recoil from three-flavor lattice QCD: A model independent determination of |V_cb|	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:C. Bernard, C. DeTar, M. Di Pierro, A.X. El-Khadra, R.T. Evans, E.D. Freeland, E. Gamiz, Steven Gottlieb, U.M. Heller, J.E. Hetrick, A.S. Kronfeld, J. Laiho, L. Levkova, P.B. Mackenzie, M. Okamoto, J. Simone, R. Sugar, D. Toussaint, R.S. Van de Water	Abstract:  We present the first lattice QCD calculation of the form factor for B-> D* l nu with three flavors of sea quarks. We use an improved staggered action for the light valence and sea quarks (the MILC configurations), and the Fermilab action for the heavy quarks. The form factor is computed at zero recoil using a new double ratio method that yields the form factor more directly than the previous Fermilab method. Other improvements over the previous calculation include the use of much lighter light quark masses, and the use of lattice (staggered) chiral perturbation theory in order to control the light quark discretization errors and chiral extrapolation. We obtain for the form factor, F_{B-> D*}(1)=0.921(13)(20), where the first error is statistical and the second is the sum of all systematic errors in quadrature. Applying a 0.7% electromagnetic correction and taking the latest PDG average for F_{B-> D*}(1)|V_cb| leads to |V_cb|=(38.7 +/- 0.9_exp +/- 1.0_theo) x 10^-3. 
0808.02520	SUSY/Non-SUSY Duality in U(N) Gauge Model with Partially Broken N=2 Supersymmetry	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Kazunobu Maruyoshi	Abstract:  We study the vacuum structure of the U(N) gauge model with partially broken N=2 supersymmetry. From the analysis of the classical vacua of this model, we point out that in addition to the ordinary N=1 supersymmetric vacua, there are vacua with negative gauge coupling constants, which preserve another N=1 supersymmetry. These latter vacua can be analyzed by using SUSY/non-SUSY duality which is recently proposed by Aganagic, Beem, Seo and Vafa. A dual description of these in UV is U(N) gauge theory where the supersymmetry is broken by spurion superfields. Following them, we see that there are supersymmetry preserving vacua as well as supersymmetry breaking vacua of low energy effective theory. 
0808.02521	An observation about submatrices	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Sourav Chatterjee, Michel Ledoux	Abstract:  Let M be an arbitrary Hermitian matrix of order n, and k be a positive integer less than or equal to n. We show that if k is large, the distribution of eigenvalues on the real line is almost the same for almost all principal submatrices of M of order k. The proof uses results about random walks on symmetric groups and concentration of measure. In a similar way, we also show that almost all k x n submatrices of M have almost the same distribution of singular values. 
0808.02522	Unification theorems in algebraic geometry	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:E. Daniyarova, A. Myasnikov, V. Remeslennikov	Abstract:  In this paper, for a given finitely generated algebra (an algebraic structure with arbitrary operations and no predicates) A we study finitely generated limit algebras of A, approaching them via model theory and algebraic geometry. Along the way we lay down foundations of algebraic geometry over arbitrary algebraic structures. 
0808.02523	Density functional with full exact exchange, balanced nonlocality of correlation, and constraint satisfaction	Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)	Authors:John P. Perdew, Viktor N. Staroverov, Jianmin Tao, Gustavo E. Scuseria	Abstract:  We construct a nonlocal density functional approximation with full exact exchange, while preserving the constraint-satisfaction approach and justified error cancellations of simpler semilocal functionals. This is achieved by interpolating between different approximations suitable for two extreme regions of the electron density. "Normal" regions are well described by semilocal approximations, because of proper accuracy for a slowly-varying density or because of error cancellation between exchange and correlation. "Abnormal" regions, where nonlocality is unveiled, include those in which exchange can dominate correlation (one-electron, nonuniform high-density, and rapidly-varying limits), and those open subsystems of fluctuating electron number over which the exact exchange-correlation hole integrates to a value greater than -1. Regions between these extremes are described by a hybrid functional mixing exact and semilocal exchange energy densities locally. Because our mixing fraction tends to 1 in the high-density limit, we rigorously employ full exact exchange. However, the nonlocality of exchange also requires balanced nonlocality of correlation, which can demand at least five empirical parameters. Our local hybrid functional is perhaps the first size-consistent fourth-rung density functional or hyper-GGA with full exact exchange, is exact for all one-electron densities, and provides an excellent fit to the 223 molecular enthalpies of formation of the G3/99 set and the 42 reaction barrier heights of the BH42/03 set, improving both (but especially the latter) over most semilocal functionals and global hybrids. 
0808.02524	A Geometrical Approach to Hilbert-Schmidt Operators	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Gabriel Larotonda	Abstract:  We give a Riemannian structure to the set $Σ$ of positive invertible unitized Hilbert-Schmidt operators, by means of the trace inner product. This metric makes of $Σ$ a nonpositively curved, simply connected and metrically complete Hilbert manifold. The manifold $Σ$ is a universal model for symmetric spaces of the noncompact type: any such space can be isometrically embedded into $Σ$. We give an intrinsic algebraic characterization of convex closed submanifolds $M$. We study the group of isometries of such submanifolds: we prove that $G_M$, the Banach-Lie group generated by $M$, acts isometrically and transitively on $M$. Moreover, $G_M$ admits a polar decomposition relative to $M$, namely $G_M\simeq M\times K$ as Hilbert manifolds (here $K$ is the isotropy of $p=1$ for the action $I_g: p\mapsto gpg^*$), and also $G_M/K\simeq M$ so $M$ is an homogeneous space. We obtain several decomposition theorems by means of geodesically convex submanifolds $M$. These decompositions are obtained \textit{via} a nonlinear but analytic orthogonal projection $Π_M:Σ\to M$, a map which is a contraction for the geodesic distance. As a byproduct, we prove the isomorphism $NM\simeqΣ$ (here $NM$ stands for the normal bundle of a convex closed submanifold $M$). Writing down the factorizations for fixed ${\rm e}^a$, we obtain ${\rm e}^a={\rm e}^x{\rm e}^v{\rm e}^x$ with ${\rm e}^x\in M$ and $v$ orthogonal to $M$ at $p=1$. As a corollary we obtain decompositions for the full group of invertible elements $G\simeq M\times \exp(T_1M^{\perp})\times K$. 
0808.02525	Hopf-Rinow Theorem in the Sato Grassmannian	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Esteban Andruchow, Gabriel Larotonda	Abstract:  Let $U_2({\cal H})$ be the Banach-Lie group of unitary operators in the Hilbert space ${\cal H}$ which are Hilbert-Schmidt perturbations of the identity 1. In this paper we study the geometry of the unitary orbit $$\{upu^*: u\in U_2({\cal H})\},$$ of an infinite projection $p$ in ${\cal H}$. This orbit coincides with the connected component of $p$ in the Hilbert-Schmidt restricted Grassmannian $Gr_{res}(p)$ (also known in the literature as the Sato Grassmannian) corresponding to the polarization ${\cal H}=p({\cal H})\oplus p({\cal H})^\perp$. It is known that the components of $Gr_{res}(p)$ are differentiable manifolds. Here we give a simple proof of the fact that $Gr_{res}^0(p)$ is a smooth submanifold of the affine Hilbert space $p+{\cal B}_2({\cal H})$, where ${\cal B}_2({\cal H})$ denotes the space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators of ${\cal H}$. We prove that the geodesics of the natural connection, which are of the form $γ(t)=e^{tz}pe^{-tz}$, for $z$ a $p$-codiagonal anti-hermitic element of ${\cal B}_2({\cal H})$, have minimal length provided that $\|z\|\le π/2$. Note that the condition is given in terms of the usual operator norm, a fact which implies that there exist minimal geodesics of arbitrary length. Also we show that any two points $p_1,p_2\in Gr_{res}^0(p)$ are joined by a minimal geodesic. If moreover $\|p_1-p_2\|<1$, the minimal geodesic is unique. Finally, we replace the 2-norm by the $k$-Schatten norm ($k>2$), and prove that the geodesics are also minimal for these norms, up to a critical value of $t$, which is estimated also in terms of the usual operator norm. In the process, minimality results in the $k$-norms are also obtained for the group $U_2({\cal H})$. 
0808.02526	The subhalo - satellite connection and the fate of disrupted satellite galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Xiaohu Yang (SHAO), H.J. Mo (UMass), Frank C. van den Bosch (MPIA)    	Abstract:  In the standard paradigm, satellite galaxies are believed to be associated with the population of dark matter subhalos. In this paper, we use the conditional stellar mass functions of {\it satellite galaxies} obtained from a large galaxy group catalogue together with models of the subhalo mass functions to explore the fraction and fate of stripped stars from satellites in galaxy groups and clusters of different masses. The majority of the stripped stars in massive halos are predicted to end up as intra-cluster stars, and the predicted amounts of the intra-cluster component as a function of the velocity dispersion of galaxy system match well the observational results obtained by Gonzalez et al. (2007). The fraction of the mass in the stripped stars to that remain bound in the central and satellite galaxies is the highest ($\sim 40%$ of the total stellar mass) in halos with masses $M_h\sim 10^{14}\msunh$. If all these stars end up in the intra-cluster component (Max), or maximum of them are accreted into the central galaxy (Min), then we can predict that a maximum $\sim 19%$ and a minimum $\sim 5%$ of the total stars in the whole universe are in terms of the diffused intra-cluster component. In the former case, in massive halos with $M_h \sim 10^{15} \msunh$, the stellar mass of the intra-cluster component is roughly 6 times as large as that of the central galaxy. This factor decreases to $\sim 2$, 1 and 0.1 in halos with $M_h \sim 10^{14}$, $10^{13}$, and $10^{12} \msunh$, respectively. The total amount of stars stripped from satellite galaxies is insufficient to build up the central galaxies in halos with masses $\la 10^{12.5}\msunh$, and so the quenching of star formation must occur in halos with higher masses. Abridged. 
0808.02527	Weak Riemannian manifolds from finite index subfactors	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Esteban Andruchow, Gabriel Larotonda	Abstract:  Let $N\subset M$ be a finite Jones' index inclusion of II$_1$ factors, and denote by $U_N\subset U_M$ their unitary groups. In this paper we study the homogeneous space $U_M/U_N$, which is a (infinite dimensional) differentiable manifold, diffeomorphic to the orbit $$ {\cal O}(p) =\{u p u^*: u\in U_M\} $$ of the Jones projection $p$ of the inclusion. We endow ${\cal O}(p) $ with a Riemannian metric, by means of the trace on each tangent space. These are pre-Hilbert spaces (the tangent spaces are not complete), therefore ${\cal O}(p)$ is a weak Riemannian manifold. We show that ${\cal O}(p)$ enjoys certain properties similar to classic Hilbert-Riemann manifolds. Among them, metric completeness of the geodesic distance, uniqueness of geodesics of the Levi-Civita connection as minimal curves, and partial results on the existence of minimal geodesics. For instance, around each point $p_1$ of ${\cal O}(p)$, there is a ball $\{q\in {\cal O}(p):\|q-p_1\|<r\}$ (of uniform radius $r$) of the usual norm of $M$, such that any point $p_2$ in the ball is joined to $p_1$ by a unique geodesic, which is shorter than any other piecewise smooth curve lying inside this ball. We also give an intrinsic (algebraic) characterization of the directions of degeneracy of the submanifold inclusion ${\cal O}(p)\subset {\cal P}(M_1)$, where the last set denotes the Grassmann manifold of the von Neumann algebra generated by $M$ and $p$. 
0808.02528	On Integral Operators with Operator Valued Kernels	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Rishad Shahmurov	Abstract:  Here Lq-Lp boundedness of integral operator with operator-valued kernels is studied and the main result is applied to convolution operators. Using these results Besov space regularity for Fourier multiplier operator is established. 
0808.02529	Deep Near-IR Surface Photometry of 57 Galaxies in the Local Sphere of Influence	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Emma Kirby, Helmut Jerjen, Stuart Ryder, Simon Driver	Abstract:  We present H-band surface photometry of 57 galaxies drawn from the Local Sphere of Influence (LSI) with distances of less than 10 Mpc from the Milky Way. The images with a typical surface brightness limit 4 mag fainter than 2MASS (24.5 mag arcsec^-2 < sb_lim < 26 mag arcsec ^-2) have been obtained with IRIS2 on the 3.9 m Anglo-Australian Telescope. A total of 22 galaxies that remained previously undetected in the near-IR and potentially could have been genuinely young galaxies were found to have an old stellar population with a star density 1-2 magnitudes below the 2MASS detection threshold. The cleaned near-IR images reveal the morphology and extent of many of the galaxies for the first time. For all program galaxies, we derive radial luminosity profiles, ellipticities, and position angles, together with global parameters such as total magnitude, mean effective surface brightness and half-light radius. Our results show that 2MASS underestimates the total magnitude of galaxies with <mu_H>_eff between 18-21 mag arcsec^-2 by up to 2.5 mag. The Sersic parameters best describing the observed surface brightness profiles are also presented. Adopting accurate galaxy distances and a H-band mass-to-light ratio of Upsilon_H=1.0 +/- 0.4, the LSI galaxies are found to cover a stellar mass range of 5.6 < log_10 (M_stars) < 11.1. The results are discussed along with previously obtained optical data. Our sample of low luminosity galaxies is found to follow closely the optical-infrared B versus H luminosity relation defined by brighter galaxies with a slope of 1.14 +/- 0.02 and scatter of 0.3 magnitudes. Finally we analyse the luminosity - surface brightness relation to determine an empirical mass-to-light ratio of Upsilon_H=0.78 +/- 0.08 for late-type galaxies in the H-band. 
0808.02530	Fair Scheduling in Networks Through Packet Election	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Srikanth Jagabathula, Devavrat Shah	Abstract:  We consider the problem of designing a fair scheduling algorithm for discrete-time constrained queuing networks. Each queue has dedicated exogenous packet arrivals. There are constraints on which queues can be served simultaneously. This model effectively describes important special instances like network switches, interference in wireless networks, bandwidth sharing for congestion control and traffic scheduling in road roundabouts. Fair scheduling is required because it provides isolation to different traffic flows; isolation makes the system more robust and enables providing quality of service. Existing work on fairness for constrained networks concentrates on flow based fairness. As a main result, we describe a notion of packet based fairness by establishing an analogy with the ranked election problem: packets are voters, schedules are candidates and each packet ranks the schedules based on its priorities. We then obtain a scheduling algorithm that achieves the described notion of fairness by drawing upon the seminal work of Goodman and Markowitz (1952). This yields the familiar Maximum Weight (MW) style algorithm. As another important result we prove that algorithm obtained is throughput optimal. There is no reason a priori why this should be true, and the proof requires non-traditional methods. 
0808.02531	Quantum memory for light using extended atomic ensembles in a tunable cavity	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Alexey Kalachev	Abstract:  Cavity-assisted storage and retrieval of single-photon wave packets in optically thin spatially extended resonant materials are analyzed. It is shown that the use of cavity tuning allows one to store and recall time-symmetric double-sided exponential pulses with near unit efficiency. The optimal regime of the cavity tuning is determined and the effect of time jitter on the storage efficiency is analyzed. 
0808.02532	Sensitivity of PDR Calculations to Microphysical Details	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:N. P. Abel, P. A. M. van Hoof, G. Shaw, G. J. Ferland, T. Elwert	Abstract:  Our understanding of physical processes in Photodissociation regions or Photon Dominated Regions (PDRs) largely depends on the ability of spectral synthesis codes to reproduce the observed infrared emission-line spectrum. In this paper, we explore the sensitivity of a single PDR model to microphysical details. Our calculations use the Cloudy spectral synthesis code, recently modified to include a wealth of PDR physical processes. We show how the chemical/thermal structure of a PDR, along with the calculated spectrum, changes when the treatment of physical processes such as grain physics and atomic/molecular rates are varied. We find a significant variation in the intensities of PDR emission lines, depending on different treatments of the grain physics. We also show how different combinations of the cosmic-ray ionization rate, inclusion of grain-atom/ion charge transfer, and the grain size distribution can lead to very similar results for the chemical structure. Additionally, our results show the utility of Cloudy for the spectral modeling of molecular environments. 
0808.02533	Quantum tetrahedron and its classical limit	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Daniel R. Terno	Abstract:  We present an asymptotically optimal generalized measurement for the Classical information that is retrieved from a quantum tetrahedron is intrinsically fuzzy. We present an asymptotically optimal generalized measurement for the extraction of classical information from a quantum tetrahedron. For a single tetrahedron the optimal uncertainty in dihedral angles is shown to scale as an inverse of the surface area. Having commutative observables allows to show how the clustering of many small tetrahedra leads to a faster convergence to a classical geometry. 
0808.02534	The AAT/WFI survey of the Monoceros Ring and Canis Major Dwarf galaxy: II. from l = (280 - 025)deg	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Blair C. Conn, Richard R. Lane, Geraint F. Lewis, Mike J. Irwin, Rodrigo A. Ibata, Nicolas F. Martin, Michele Bellazzini, Artem V. Tuntsov	Abstract:  This paper concludes a systematic search for evidence of the Monoceros Ring and Canis Major dwarf galaxy around the Galactic Plane. Presented here are the results for the Galactic longitude range of l = (280 - 025)deg. Testing the claim that the Monoceros Ring encircles the entire Galaxy, this survey attempts to document the position of the Monoceros Ring with increasing Galactic longitude. Additionally, with the discovery of the purported Canis Major dwarf galaxy, searching for more evidence of its interaction is imperative to tracing its path through the Galaxy and understanding its role in the evolution of the Milky Way. Two new detections of the Monoceros Ring have been found at (l, b) = (280,+15)deg and (300,+10)deg. Interestingly, in general there seem to be more detections above the Plane than below it; in this survey around 2/3 of the firm Monoceros Ring detections are in the North. This coincides with the Northern detections appearing to be qualitatively denser and broader than their Southern counterparts. The maximum of the Galactic Warp in the South is also probed in this survey. It is found that these fields do not resemble those in the Canis Major region suggesting that the Warp does not change the shape of the CMD as is witnessed around Canis Major. The origins and morphology of the Monoceros Ring is still elusive primarily due to its enormous extent on the sky. Continued probing of the Galactic Outer Disc is needed before a consensus can be reached on its nature. 
0808.02535	High Kondo temperature (TK ~ 80 K) in self-assembled InAs quantum dots laterally coupled to nanogap electrodes	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:K. Shibata, K. Hirakawa	Abstract:  We have fabricated single electron tunneling structures by forming nanogap metallic electrodes directly upon single self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs). The fabricated samples exhibited clear Coulomb blockade effects. Furthermore, a clear Kondo effect was observed when strong coupling between the electrodes and the QDs was realized using a large QD with a diameter of ~ 100 nm. From the temperature dependence of the linear conductance at the Kondo valley, the Kondo temperature TK was determined to be ~ 81 K. This is the highest TK ever reported for artificial quantum nanostructures. 
0808.02536	Lighthouses with two lights: burst oscillations from the accretion-powered millisecond pulsars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Anna L. Watts (University of Amsterdam)    	Abstract:  The key contribution of the discovery of nuclear-powered pulsations from the accretion-powered millisecond pulsars (AMPs) has been the establishment of burst oscillation frequency as a reliable proxy for stellar spin rate. This has doubled the sample of rapidly-rotating accreting neutron stars and revealed the unexpected absence of any stars rotating near the break-up limit. The resulting `braking problem' is now a major concern for theorists, particularly given the possible role of gravitational wave emission in limiting spin. This, however, is not the only area where burst oscillations from the AMPs are having an impact. Burst oscillation timing is developing into a promising technique for verifying the level of spin variability in the AMPs (a topic of considerable debate). These sources also provide unique input to our efforts to understand the still-elusive burst oscillation mechanism. This is because they are the only stars where we can reliably gauge the role of uneven fuel deposition and, of course, the magnetic field. 
0808.02537	Ekedahl-Oort strata and Kottwitz-Rapoport strata	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Ulrich Goertz, Maarten Hoeve	Abstract:  We study the moduli space A_g of g-dimensional principally polarized abelian varieties in positive characteristic, and its variant A_I with Iwahori level structure. Both supersingular Ekedahl-Oort strata and supersingular Kottwitz-Rapoport strata are isomorphic to disjoint unions of Deligne-Lusztig varieties (see [Hoeve 2008] and [Goertz, Yu 2008], resp.). Here we compare these isomorphisms. We also give an explicit description of Kottwitz-Rapoport strata contained in the supersingular locus in the general parahoric case. Finally, we show that every Ekedahl-Oort stratum is isomorphic to a parahoric Kottwitz-Rapoport stratum. 
0808.02538	Vafa-Witten Theory on N=2 and N=4 Twisted Superspace in Four Dimensions	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Junji Kato, Akiko Miyake	Abstract:  We construct a new off-shell twisted hypermultiplet with a scalar and an anti-self-dual tensor superfields. Using the N=2 twisted superspace formalism, we construct a Donaldson-Witten theory coupled to the hypermultiplet. We show that this action possesses the Vafa-Witten type N=4 twisted supersymmetry at the on-shell level. We also reconstruct the action using a N=4 twisted superconnection formalism. 
0808.02539	Microlensing Optical Depth Revisited with Recent Star Counts	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yoon-Hyun Ryu, Heon-Young Chang, Myeong-Gu Park, Ki-Won Lee	Abstract:  More reliable constraints on the microlensing optical depth comes from a better understanding of the Galactic model. Based on well-constrained Galactic bulge and disk models constructed from survey observations, such as, HST, 2MASS, and SDSS, we calculate the microlensing optical depths toward the Galactic bulge fields, and compare them with recent results of microlensing surveys. We test chi^2 statistics of microlensing optical depths expected from those models, as well as previously proposed models, using two types of data: optical depth map in (l, b) and averaged optical depth over the Galactic longitude l as a function of the latitude b. From this analysis, we find that the Galactic bulge models of 2MASS, Han & Gould (2003), and G2 of Stanek et al. (1997) show a good agreement with the microlensing optical depth profiles for all the microlensing observations, compared with E2 of Stanek et al. (1997). We find, on the other hand, that models involving an SDSS disk model produce relatively higher chi^2 values. It should be noted that modeled microlensing optical depths diverge in the low Galactic latitude, |b| < 2 arcdeg. Therefore, we suggest the microlensing observation toward much closer to central regions of the Galaxy to further test the proposed Galactic models, if it is more technically feasible than waiting for large data set of microlensing events. 
0808.02540	Tau sleptons and Tau sneutrino Decays in MSSM under the Cosmological Bounds	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:L. Selbuz, Z. Z. Aydin	Abstract:  We present the numerical investigation of the fermionic two-body decays of tau sleptons $\tilde τ_{1,2}$ and $τ$ sneutrino in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with complex parameters. In the analysis we particularly take into account the cosmological bounds imposed by WMAP data. We plot the CP-phase dependences for each fermionic two-body channel of $\tilde τ_{1,2}$ and $τ$ sneutrino and speculate about the branching ratios and total (two-body) decay widths. We find that the phase dependences of the decay widths of the third family sleptons are quite significant which can provide viable probes of additional CP sources. We also draw attention to the polarization of the final-state tau in the $ \tilde τ_{1,2}$ decays. 
0808.02541	Study of the internal mechanisms of Pixelized Photon Detectors operated in Geiger-mode	Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)	Authors:H.Otono, H.Oide, S.Yamashita, T.Yoshioka, K.Yamamoto, K.Yamamura, K.Sato	Abstract:  In the 1990s, a novel semiconductor photon-sensor operated in Geiger-mode was invented in Russia (Silicon PhotoMultiplier), which consists of many tiny pixels and has a single photon level sensitivity. Since then, various types of the sensor with this scheme, Pixelized Photon Detectors (PPD), have been developed in many places in the world. For instance, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. in Japan produces the PPD as a Multi-Pixel Photon Counter. While the internal mechanisms of the PPD have been intensively studied in recent years, the existing models do not succeeded to fully reproduce the output characteristic, such as waveforms at low temperature. We have developed a new model with the transient multiplication and quenching of the realistic avalanche process and have succeeded in reproducing the output waveform of the PPD at various temperature. In this paper, we discuss our improved model. 
0808.02542	The Variable Stars of the Draco Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy - Revisited	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:K. Kinemuchi, H.C. Harris, Horace A. Smith, N.A. Silbermann, L.A. Snyder, A. P. LaCluyze, C.L. Clark	Abstract:  We present a CCD survey of variable stars in the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. This survey, which has the largest areal coverage since the original variable star survey by Baade & Swope, includes photometry for 270 RR Lyrae stars, 9 anomalous Cepheids, 2 eclipsing binaries, and 12 slow, irregular red variables, as well as 30 background QSOs. Twenty-six probable double-mode RR Lyrae stars were identified. Observed parameters, including mean V and I magnitudes, V amplitudes, and periods, have been derived. Photometric metallicities of the ab-type RR Lyrae stars were calculated according to the method of Jurcsik & Kovacs, yielding a mean metallicity of <[Fe/H]> = -2.19 +/- 0.03. The well known Oosterhoff intermediate nature of the RR Lyrae stars in Draco is reconfirmed, although the double-mode RR Lyrae stars with one exception have properties similar to those found in Oosterhoff type II globular clusters. The period-luminosity relation of the anomalous Cepheids is rediscussed with the addition of the new Draco anomalous Cepheids. 
0808.02543	A Refined Difference Field Theory for Symbolic Summation	Symbolic Computation (cs.SC)	Authors:Carsten Schneider	Abstract:  In this article we present a refined summation theory based on Karr's difference field approach. The resulting algorithms find sum representations with optimal nested depth. For instance, the algorithms have been applied successively to evaluate Feynman integrals from Perturbative Quantum Field Theory. 
0808.02544	Morphic and Automatic Words: Maximal Blocks and Diophantine Approximation	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Yann Bugeaud, Dalia Krieger, Jeffrey Shallit	Abstract:  Let $\mb w$ be a morphic word over a finite alphabet $Σ$, and let $Δ$ be a nonempty subset of $Σ$. We study the behavior of maximal blocks consisting only of letters from $Δ$ in $\mb w$, and prove the following: let $(i_k,j_k)$ denote the starting and ending positions, respectively, of the $k$'th maximal $Δ$-block in $\mb w$. Then $\limsup_{k\to\infty} (j_k/i_k)$ is algebraic if $\mb w$ is morphic, and rational if $\mb w$ is automatic. As a result, we show that the same conclusion holds if $(i_k,j_k)$ are the starting and ending positions of the $k$'th maximal zero block, and, more generally, of the $k$'th maximal $x$-block, where $x$ is an arbitrary word. This enables us to draw conclusions about the irrationality exponent of automatic and morphic numbers. In particular, we show that the irrationality exponent of automatic (resp., morphic) numbers belonging to a certain class that we define is rational (resp., algebraic). 
0808.02545	Vector partition functions and index of transversally elliptic operators	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Corrado De Concini, Claudio C. Procesi, Michele Vergne	Abstract:  Let G be a torus acting linearly on a complex vector space M, and let X be the list of weights of G in M. We determine the equivariant K-theory of the open subset of M consisting of points with finite stabilizers. We identify it to the space DM(X) of functions on the lattice of weights of G, satisfying the cocircuit difference equations associated to X, introduced by Dahmen--Micchelli in the context of the theory of splines in order to study vector partition functions. This allows us to determine the range of the index map from G-transversally elliptic operators on M to generalized functions on G and to prove that the index map is an isomorphism on the image. This is a setting studied by Atiyah-Singer which is in a sense universal for index computations. 
0808.02546	On the basic mechanism of Pixelized Photon Detectors	Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)	Authors:H.Otono, H.Oide, S.Yamashita, T.Yoshioka	Abstract:  A Pixelized Photon Detector (PPD) is a generic name for the semiconductor devices operated in the Geiger-mode, such as Silicon PhotoMultiplier and Multi-Pixel Photon Counter, which has high photon counting capability. While the internal mechanisms of the PPD have been intensively studied in recent years, the existing models do not include the avalanche process. We have simulated the multiplication and quenching of the avalanche process and have succeeded in reproducing the output waveform of the PPD. Furthermore our model predicts the existence of dead-time in the PPD which has never been numerically predicted. For serching the dead-time, we also have developed waveform analysis method using deconvolution which has the potential to distinguish neibouring pulses precisely. In this paper, we discuss our improved model and waveform analysis method. 
0808.02547	Weyl-Titchmarsh functions of vector-valued Sturm-Liouville operators on the unit interval	Spectral Theory (math.SP)	Authors:Dmitry Chelkak, Evgeny Korotyaev	Abstract:  The matrix-valued Weyl-Titchmarsh functions $M(λ)$ of vector-valued Sturm-Liouville operators on the unit interval with the Dirichlet boundary conditions are considered. The collection of the eigenvalues (i.e., poles of $M(λ)$) and the residues of $M(λ)$ is called the spectral data of the operator. The complete characterization of spectral data (or, equivalently, $N\times N$ Weyl-Titchmarsh functions) corresponding to $N\times N$ self-adjoint square-integrable matrix-valued potentials is given, if all $N$ eigenvalues of the averaged potential are distinct. 
0808.02548	Negative Beta Encoder	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Tohru Kohda, Satoshi Hironaka, Kazuyuki Aihara	Abstract:  A new class of analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) converters using a flaky quantiser, called the $β$-encoder, has been shown to have exponential bit rate accuracy while possessing a self-correction property for fluctuations of the amplifier factor $β$ and the quantiser threshold $ν$. The probabilistic behavior of such a flaky quantiser is explained as the deterministic dynamics of the multi-valued Rényi map. That is, a sample $x$ is always confined to a contracted subinterval while successive approximations of $x$ are performed using $β$-expansion even if $ν$ may vary at each iteration. This viewpoint enables us to get the decoded sample, which is equal to the midpoint of the subinterval, and its associated characteristic equation for recovering $β$ which improves the quantisation error by more than $3{dB}$ when $β>1.5$. The invariant subinterval under the Rényi map shows that $ν$ should be set to around the midpoint of its associated greedy and lazy values. %in terms of its quantisation MSE (mean square error). Furthermore, a new A/D converter is introduced called the negative $β$-encoder, which further improves the quantisation error of the $β$-encoder. A two-state Markov chain describing the $β$-encoder suggests that a negative eigenvalue of its associated transition probability matrix reduces the quantisation error. 
0808.02549	The swap operation in the two-qubit Heisenberg XXZ model-effects of anisotropy and magnetic field	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Yue Zhou, Guo-Feng Zhang, Fu-Hua Yang, Song-Lin Feng	Abstract:  In this paper we study the swap operation in a two-qubit anisotropic XXZ model in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field. We establish the range of anisotropic parameter within which the swap operation is feasible. The swap errors caused by the inhomogeneous field are evaluated. 
0808.02550	The Vertical Structure of Warm Ionised Gas in the Milky Way	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:B. M. Gaensler (1), G. J. Madsen (1,2), S. Chatterjee (1), S. A. Mao (3) ((1) U. Sydney, (2) U. Wisconsin, Madison, (3) Harvard-Smithsonian CfA)    	Abstract:  We present a new joint analysis of pulsar dispersion measures and diffuse H-alpha emission in the Milky Way, which we use to derive the density, pressure and filling factor of the thick disk component of the warm ionised medium (WIM) as a function of height above the Galactic disk. By excluding sightlines at low Galactic latitude that are contaminated by HII regions and spiral arms, we find that the exponential scale-height of free electrons in the diffuse WIM is 1830 (+120, -250) pc, a factor of two larger than has been derived in previous studies. The corresponding inconsistent scale heights for dispersion measure and emission measure imply that the vertical profiles of mass and pressure in the WIM are decoupled, and that the filling factor of WIM clouds is a geometric response to the competing environmental influences of thermal and non-thermal processes. Extrapolating the properties of the thick-disk WIM to mid-plane, we infer a volume-averaged electron density 0.014 +- 0.001 cm^-3, produced by clouds of typical electron density 0.34 +- 0.06 cm^-3 with a volume filling factor 0.04 +- 0.01. As one moves off the plane, the filling factor increases to a maximum of ~30% at a height of approximately 1-1.5 kpc, before then declining to accommodate the increasing presence of hot, coronal gas. Since models for the WIM with a ~1 kpc scale-height have been widely used to estimate distances to radio pulsars, our revised parameters suggest that the distances to many high-latitude pulsars have been substantially underestimated. 
0808.02551	Evolution of Metric Perturbations in Quintom Bounce model	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yi-Fu Cai, Xinmin Zhang	Abstract:  We in the paper study the metric perturbations generated in a bouncing universe driven by the Quintom matter. Firstly, we review the background evolution of Quintom Bounce and the power spectrum of scalar perturbations. Secondly, we study the non-Gaussianity of curvature perturbations and then calculate the tensor perturbations of the model. 
0808.02552	BAT - The Bayesian Analysis Toolkit	Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)	Authors:Allen Caldwell, Daniel Kollar, Kevin Kroeninger	Abstract:  We describe the development of a new toolkit for data analysis. The analysis package is based on Bayes' Theorem, and is realized with the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo. This gives access to the full posterior probability distribution. Parameter estimation, limit setting and uncertainty propagation are implemented in a straightforward manner. A goodness-of-fit criterion is presented which is intuitive and of great practical use. 
0808.02553	A bicategorical version of Masuoka's theorem. Applications to bimodules over functor categories and to firm bimodules	Rings and Algebras (math.RA)	Authors:J. Gómez-Torrecillas, B. Mesablishvili	Abstract:  We give a bicategorical version of the main result of A. Masuoka ({Corings and invertible bimodules,} {\em Tsukuba J. Math.} \textbf{13} (1989), 353--362) which proposes a non-commutative version of the fact that for a faithfully flat extension of commutative rings $R \subseteq S$, the relative Picard group $Pic(S/R)$ is isomorphic to the Amitsur 1--cohomology group $H^1(S/R,U)$ with coefficients in the units functor $U$. 
0808.02554	The eSMA: description and first results	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Sandrine Bottinelli (1), Ken H. Young (2), Richard Chamberlin (3), Remo P.J. Tilanus (4,9), Mark A. Gurwell (2), Dave J. Wilner (2), Hiroko Shinnaga (3), Hiroshige Yoshida (3), Per Friberg (4), Huib Jan van Langevelde (5,1), Ewine F. van Dishoeck (1,6), Michiel R. Hogerheijde (1), A. Meredith Hughes (2), Robert D. Christensen (8), Richard E. Hills (7), John S. Richer (7), Emily Curtis (7), the eSMA commissioning team	Abstract:  The eSMA ("extended SMA") combines the SMA, JCMT and CSO into a single facility, providing enhanced sensitivity and spatial resolution owing to the increased collecting area at the longest baselines. Until ALMA early science observing (2011), the eSMA will be the facility capable of the highest angular resolution observations at 345 GHz. The gain in sensitivity and resolution will bring new insights in a variety of fields, such as protoplanetary/transition disks, high-mass star formation, solar system bodies, nearby and high-z galaxies. Therefore the eSMA is an important facility to prepare the grounds for ALMA and train scientists in the techniques. Over the last two years, and especially since November 2006, there has been substantial progress toward making the eSMA into a working interferometer. In particular, (i) new 345-GHz receivers, that match the capabilities of the SMA system, were installed at the JCMT and CSO; (ii) numerous tests have been performed for receiver, correlator and baseline calibrations in order to determine and take into account the effects arising from the differences between the three types of antennas; (iii) first fringes at 345 GHz were obtained on August 30 2007, and the array has entered the science-verification stage. We report on the characteristics of the eSMA and its measured performance at 230 GHz and that expected at 345 GHz. We also present the results of the commissioning and some initial science-verification observations, including the first absorption measurement of the C/CO ratio in a galaxy at z=0.89, located along the line of sight to the lensed quasar PKS1830-211, and on the imaging of the vibrationally excited HCN line towards IRC+10216. 
0808.02555	Semi-numerical power expansion of Feynman integrals	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Volker Pilipp	Abstract:  I present an algorithm based on sector decomposition and Mellin-Barnes techniques to power expand Feynman integrals. The coefficients of this expansion are given in terms of finite integrals that can be calculated numerically. I show in an example the benefit of this method for getting the full analytic power expansion from differential equations by providing the correct ansatz for the solution. For method of regions the presented algorithm provides a numerical check, which is independent from any power counting argument. 
0808.02556	Galois sections for abelianized fundamental groups	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:David Harari, Tamas Szamuely	Abstract:  Given a smooth projective curve $X$ of genus at least 2 over a number field $k$, Grothendieck's Section Conjecture predicts that the canonical projection from the étale fundamental group of $X$ onto the absolute Galois group of $k$ has a section if and only if the curve has a rational point. We show that there exist curves where the above map has a section over each completion of $k$ but not over $k$. In the appendix Victor Flynn gives explicit examples in genus 2. Our result is a consequence of a more general investigation of the existence of sections for the projection of the étale fundamental group `with abelianized geometric part' onto the Galois group. We give a criterion for the existence of sections in arbitrary dimension and over arbitrary perfect fields, and then study the case of curves over local and global fields more closely. We also point out the relation to the elementary obstruction of Colliot-Thélène and Sansuc. 
0808.02557	Quantum Many-Body Phenomena in Coupled Cavity Arrays	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Michael J. Hartmann, Fernando G.S.L. Brandao, Martin B. Plenio	Abstract:  The increasing level of experimental control over atomic and optical systems gained in the past years have paved the way for the exploration of new physical regimes in quantum optics and atomic physics, characterised by the appearance of quantum many-body phenomena, originally encountered only in condensed-matter physics, and the possibility of experimentally accessing them in a more controlled manner. In this review article we survey recent theoretical studies concerning the use of cavity quantum electrodynamics to create quantum many-body systems. Based on recent experimental progress in the fabrication of arrays of interacting micro-cavities and on their coupling to atomic-like structures in several different physical architectures, we review proposals on the realisation of paradigmatic many-body models in such systems, such as the Bose-Hubbard and the anisotropic Heisenberg models. Such arrays of coupled cavities offer interesting properties as simulators of quantum many-body physics, including the full addressability of individual sites and the accessibility of inhomogeneous models.

Szczygiel	Abstract:  We announce the release of the catalog of variable stars in the field of view of Kepler mission found from the analysis of the ASAS3-North VI photometry of about 250,000 stars. 
0808.02559	Density of States for a Short Overlapping-Bead Polymer: Clues to a Mechanism for Helix Formation?	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:James E. Magee, Leo Lue, Robin A. Curtis	Abstract:  The densities of states are evaluated for very short chain molecules made up of overlapping monomers, using a model which has previously been shown to produce helical structure. The results of numerical calculations are presented for tetramers and pentamers. We show that these models demonstrate behaviors relevant to the behaviors seen in longer, helix forming chains, particularly, "magic numbers" of the overlap parameter where the derivatives of the densities of states change discontinuously, and a region of bimodal energy probability distributions, reminiscent of a first order phase transition in a bulk system. 
0808.02560	Mean-field approach to nuclear structure with semi-realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:H. Nakada	Abstract:  Semi-realistic nucleon-nucleon interactions applicable to the self-consistent mean-field (both Hartree-Fock and Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov) calculations are developed, by modifying the M3Y interaction. The modification is made so as to reproduce binding energies and rms matter radii of doubly magic nuclei, single-particle levels in $^{208}$Pb, and even-odd mass differences of the Sn isotopes. We find parameter-sets with and without the tensor force. The new interactions are further checked by the saturation properties of the uniform nuclear matter including the Landau-Migdal parameters. By the mean-field calculations, interaction-dependence of the neutron drip line is investigated for the O, Ca and Ni isotopes, and of the single-particle energies for the N=16, 32, 50, 82 and Z=50 nuclei. Results of the semi-realistic interactions including the tensor force are in fair agreement with available experimental data for all of these properties. 
0808.02561	Quantum Einstein-Rosen waves: Coherent states and n-point functions	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:J. Fernando Barbero G., Iñaki Garay, Eduardo J. S. Villaseñor	Abstract:  We discuss two different types of issues concerning the quantization of Einstein-Rosen waves. First of all we study in detail the possibility of using the coherent states corresponding to the dynamics of the auxiliary, free Hamiltonian appearing in the description of the model to study the full dynamics of the system. For time periods of arbitrary length we show that this is only possible for states that are close, in a precise mathematical sense, to the vacuum. We do this by comparing the quantum evolutions defined by the auxiliary and physical Hamiltonians on the class of coherent states. In the second part of the paper we study the structure of n-point functions. As we will show their detailed behavior differs from the one corresponding to standard perturbative quantum field theories. We take this as a manifestation of the fact that the correct approximation scheme for physically interesting objects in these models does not lead to a power series expansion in the relevant coupling constant but to a more complicated asymptotic behavior. 
0808.02562	Spectrum Sensing Algorithms for Cognitive Radio Based on Statistical Covariances	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Yonghong Zeng, Ying-Chang Liang	Abstract:  Spectrum sensing, i.e., detecting the presence of primary users in a licensed spectrum, is a fundamental problem in cognitive radio. Since the statistical covariances of received signal and noise are usually different, they can be used to differentiate the case where the primary user's signal is present from the case where there is only noise. In this paper, spectrum sensing algorithms are proposed based on the sample covariance matrix calculated from a limited number of received signal samples. Two test statistics are then extracted from the sample covariance matrix. A decision on the signal presence is made by comparing the two test statistics. Theoretical analysis for the proposed algorithms is given. Detection probability and associated threshold are found based on statistical theory. The methods do not need any information of the signal, the channel and noise power a priori. Also, no synchronization is needed. Simulations based on narrowband signals, captured digital television (DTV) signals and multiple antenna signals are presented to verify the methods. 
0808.02563	Quantum scaling in nano-transistors	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:U. Wulf	Abstract:  In our previous papers on ballistic quantum transport in nano-transistors [J. Appl. Phys. 98, 84308 (2005)] it was demonstrated that under certain conditions it is possible to reduce the three-dimensional transport problem to an effectively one-dimensional one. We show that such an effectively one-dimensional description can be cast in a scale-invariant form. We obtain dimensionless variables for the characteristic channel length $l$ and width of the transistor which determine the scale-invariant output characteristic. For $l \gtrsim 10$, in the strong barrier regime, the output characteristics are similar to that of a conventional MOSFET assuming an ideal form for $l \to \infty$. In the weak barrier regime, $l \lesssim 10$, strong source-drain currents lead to i-v characteristics that differ qualitatively from that of a conventional transistor. Comparing with experimental data we find qualitative agreement. 
0808.02564	Pionic transparency in semi-exclusive electroproduction off nuclei	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Murat M. Kaskulov, Kai Gallmeister, Ulrich Mosel (Giessen U.)    	Abstract:  We investigate the early onset of pionic color transparency ($π$CT) observed at Jefferson Laboratory (JLAB) in semi--exclusive pion electroproduction reaction $A(e,e'π^+)$ off nuclei. In the present description the primary $γ^*p \to π^+ n$ interaction is described very well both for the longitudinal and the transverse polarizations. For the final state interactions a coupled--channel treatment of the interactions of transmitted hadrons allows to go beyond the Glauber approximation. We show that a proper distinction between the soft hadronic and hard partonic components of the electroproduction amplitude is essential for a quantitative description of the measured nuclear transparency. The data are well reproduced if one assumes that point--like configurations are produced in the regime of hard deep--inelastic scattering (DIS) off partons and dominate the transverse channel. 
0808.02565	Localized states and interaction induced delocalization in Bose gases with quenched disorder	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:G.M. Falco, T. Nattermann, V.L. Pokrovsky	Abstract:  Very diluted Bose gas placed into a disordered environment falls into a fragmented localized state. At some critical density the repulsion between particles overcomes the disorder. The gas transits into a coherent superfluid state. In this article the geometrical and energetic characteristics of the localized state at zero temperature and the critical density at which the quantum phase transition from the localized to the superfluid state proceeds are found. 
0808.02566	Magnetic properties of PrCu$_2$ at high pressure	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:A. Sacchetti, M. Weller, H.R. Ott, Y. Onuki	Abstract:  We report a study of the low-temperature high-pressure phase diagram of the intermetallic compound PrCu$_2$, by means of molecular-field calculations and $^{63,65}$Cu nuclear-quadrupole-resonance (NQR) measurements under pressure. The pressure-induced magnetically-ordered phase can be accounted for by considering the influence of the crystal electric field on the $4f$ electron orbitals of the Pr$^{3+}$ ions and by introducing a pressure-dependent exchange interaction between the corresponding local magnetic moments. Our experimental data suggest that the order in the induced antiferromagnetic phase is incommensurate. The role of magnetic fluctuations both at high and low pressures is also discussed. 
0808.02567	The Flavour of Inflation	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:I. Zavala	Abstract:  A new class of particle physics models of inflation based on the phase transition associated with the spontaneous breaking of family symmetry is proposed. The Higgs fields responsible for the breaking of family symmetry, the flavons, are natural inflaton candidates or waterfall fields in hybrid inflation. This opens up a rich vein of possible inflation models, all linked to the physics of flavour, with several interesting cosmological implications. 
0808.02568	Study of Systematic Uncertainties of Single Top Production at ATLAS	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Gia Khoriauli	Abstract:  Sytematic uncertainties to the single top production cross section measurement at the ATLAS experiment has been studied. Different sources of systematic uncertainties such as detector luminosity, jet energy calibration, SM background normalization, PDF parameterization and others have been considered. Large scale Monte-Carlo events simulation has been performed to estimate the contribution of each source in the overall uncertainty. The study was done for cut based analysis as well as for multivariate analysis of the single top measurements in ATLAS. The total systematic uncertainties of the single top cross-section measurements in its three production channels have been estimated at 1 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ and 10 $\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity of the LHC. 
0808.02569	Correlation Energy and the Spin Susceptibility of the Two-Valley Two-dimensional Electron Gas	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:M. Marchi, S. De Palo, S. Moroni, Gaetano Senatore	Abstract:  We find that the spin susceptibility of a two-dimensional electron system with valley degeneracy does not grow critically at low densities, at variance with experimental results [A. Shashkin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 036403 (2006)]. We ascribe this apparent discrepancy to the weak disorder present in experimental samples. Our prediction is obtained from accurate correlation energies computed with state of-the-art diffusion Monte Carlo simulations and fitted with an analytical expression which also provides a local spin density functional for the system under investigation. 
0808.02570	Effects of a localized beam on the dynamics of excitable cavity solitons	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Adrian Jacobo, Damia Gomila, Manuel A. Matias, Pere Colet	Abstract:  We study the dynamical behavior of dissipative solitons in an optical cavity filled with a Kerr medium when a localized beam is applied on top of the homogeneous pumping. In particular, we report on the excitability regime that cavity solitons exhibits which is emergent property since the system is not locally excitable. The resulting scenario differs in an important way from the case of a purely homogeneous pump and now two different excitable regimes, both Class I, are shown. The whole scenario is presented and discussed, showing that it is organized by three codimension-2 points. Moreover, the localized beam can be used to control important features, such as the excitable threshold, improving the possibilities for the experimental observation of this phenomenon. 
0808.02571	On the First Order Phase Transitions Signal in Multiple Production Processes	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:J.Manjavidze, A.Sissakian	Abstract:  We offer the parameter, interpreted as the "chemical potential", which is sensitive to the first order phase transition: it must decrease with number of evaporating (produced) particles (hadrons) if the (interacting hadron or/and QCD plasma) medium is boiling and it increase if no phase transition occur. The main part of the paper is devoted to the question: how one can measure the "chemical potential" in the hadron inelastic processes. Our definition of this parameter is quite general but assumes that the hadron multiplicity is sufficiently large. The simple transparent phenomenological lattice gas model is considered for sake of clarity only. 
0808.02572	Axions and Photons In Terms of "Particles" and "Anti-Particles"	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Eduardo I. Guendelman, Idan Shilon	Abstract:  The axion photon system in an external magnetic field, when for example considered with the geometry of the experiments exploring axion photon mixing (which can be represented by a 1+1 effective model) displays a continuous axion-photon duality symmetry in the limit the axion mass is neglected. The conservation law that follows from this symmetry is obtained. The magnetic field interaction is seen to be equivalent to first order to the interaction of a complex charged field with an external electric potential, where this ficticious "electric potential" is proportional to the external magnetic field. This allows one to solve for the scattering amplitudes using already known scalar QED results. Axion photon oscillations can be understood as violations of a charge symmetry in the scalar QED language. Going beyond the linear theory, the axion photon system in a self consistent magnetic field is shown, using this formalism, to have interesting soliton solutions that represent new non gravitational ways of trapping light. Finally, generalizing the scalar QED formalism to 2+1 dimensions makes it clear that a photon and an axion splitt into two components in an inhomogeneous magnetic field, an effect that reminds us of the Stern Gerlach experiment. 
0808.02573	A method for characterization of coherent backgrounds in real time and its application in gravitational wave data analysis	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:E. J. Daw, M. R. Hewitson	Abstract:  Many experiments, and in particular gravitational wave detectors, produce continuous streams of data whose frequency representations contain discrete, relatively narrowband coherent features at high amplitude. We discuss the application of digital Fourier transforms (DFTs) to characterization of these features, hereafter frequently referred to as lines. Application of DFTs to continuously produced time domain data are achieved through an algorithm hereafter referred to as EFC for efficient time-domain determination of the Fourier coefficients of a data set. We first define EFC and discuss parameters relating to the algorithm that determine its properties and action on the data. In gravitational wave interferometers, these lines are commonly due to parasitic sources of coherent background interference coupling into the instrument. Using GEO 600 data, we next demonstrate that time domain subtraction of lines can proceed without detrimental effects either on features at frequencies separated from that of the subtracted line, or on features at the frequency of the line but having different stationarity properties. 
0808.02574	A Better Way to Reconstruct Dark Energy Models ?	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:A. Sil, S. Som	Abstract:  To reconstruct dark energy models the redshift $z_{eq}$, marking the end of radiation era and the beginning of matter-dominated era, can play a role as important as $z_{t}$, the redshift at which deceleration parameter experiences a signature flip. To implement the idea we propose a variable equation of state for matter that can bring a smooth transition from radiation to matter-dominated era in a single model. A popular $Λ\propto ρ$ dark energy model is chosen for demonstration but found to be unacceptable. An alternative $Λ\propto ρa^{3}$ model is proposed and found to be more close to observation. 
0808.02575	Consistent boundary conditions for cosmological topologically massive gravity at the chiral point	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Daniel Grumiller, Niklas Johansson	Abstract:  We show that cosmological topologically massive gravity at the chiral point allows not only Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions as consistent boundary conditions, but slightly more general ones which encompass the logarithmic primary found in 0805.2610 as well as all its descendants. 
0808.02576	Measurement of $B^0\toπ^+π^-π^+π^-$ Decays and Search for $B^0\toρ^0ρ^0$	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The Belle Collaboration: C.-C. Chiang, et al    	Abstract:  We report on a search for the decay $B^0\toρ^0ρ^0$ and other charmless modes with a $π^+π^-π^+π^-$ final state, including $B^0\toρ^0π^+π^-$, non-resonant $B^0\to 4π^{\pm}$, $B^0\toρ^0f_0(980)$, $B^0\to f_0(980)f_0(980)$ and $B^0\to f_0(980)π^+π^-$. These results are obtained from a data sample containing 657 million $B \overline B$ pairs collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider. We set an upper limit on $\mathcal{B}(B^0\toρ^0ρ^0)$ of $1.0\times 10^{-6}$ at the 90% confidence level (C.L.). From our $B^0\toρ^0ρ^0$ measurement and an isospin analysis, we determine the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa phase $φ_2$ to be $91.7 \pm 14.9$ degrees. We find excesses in $B^0\to ρ^0π^+π^-$ and non-resonant $B^0\to 4π^{\pm}$ with 1.3$σ$ and 2.5$σ$ significance, respectively. The corresponding branching fractions are less than $12.0 \times 10^{-6}$ and $19.3 \times 10^{-6}$ at the 90% C.L. In addition, we set 90% C.L. upper limits as follows: $\mathcal{B}(B^0\toρ^0f_0(980))< 0.3 \times 10^{-6}$, $\mathcal{B}(B^0\to f_0(980)f_0(980))< 0.1 \times 10^{-6}$, and $\mathcal{B}(B^0\to f_0(980)π^+π^-)< 3.8 \times 10^{-6}$. 
0808.02577	A random telegraph signal of Mittag-Leffler type	Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)	Authors:Simone Ferraro, Michele Manzini, Aldo Masoero, Enrico Scalas	Abstract:  A general method is presented to explicitly compute autocovariance functions for non-Poisson dichotomous noise based on renewal theory. The method is specialized to a random telegraph signal of Mittag-Leffler type. Analytical predictions are compared to Monte Carlo simulations. Non-Poisson dichotomous noise is non-stationary and standard spectral methods fail to describe it properly as they assume stationarity. 
0808.02578	Equivalence of robust stabilization and robust performance via feedback	Optimization and Control (math.OC)	Authors:J.A. Ball, Q. Fang, G.J. Groenewald, S. ter Horst	Abstract:  One approach to robust control for linear plants with structured uncertainty as well as for linear parameter-varying (LPV) plants (where the controller has on-line access to the varying plant parameters) is through linear-fractional-transformation (LFT) models. Control issues to be addressed by controller design in this formalism include robust stability and robust performance. Here robust performance is defined as the achievement of a uniform specified $L^{2}$-gain tolerance for a disturbance-to-error map combined with robust stability. By setting the disturbance and error channels equal to zero, it is clear that any criterion for robust performance also produces a criterion for robust stability. Counter-intuitively, as a consequence of the so-called Main Loop Theorem, application of a result on robust stability to a feedback configuration with an artificial full-block uncertainty operator added in feedback connection between the error and disturbance signals produces a result on robust performance. The main result here is that this performance-to-stabilization reduction principle must be handled with care for the case of dynamic feedback compensation: casual application of this principle leads to the solution of a physically uninteresting problem, where the controller is assumed to have access to the states in the artificially-added feedback loop. Application of the principle using a known more refined dynamic-control robust stability criterion, where the user is allowed to specify controller partial-state dimensions, leads to correct robust-performance results. These latter results involve rank conditions in addition to Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) conditions. 
0808.02579	Parton Densities at the LHC	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:A. Tricoli, for the ATLAS Collaboration	Abstract:  This contribution to the Italian "Workshop sui Monte Carlo, la Fisica e le Simulazioni a LHC", held at LNF, Frascati, in February, May and October 2006, summarises the status of parton density functions (PDF's) and the impact of their uncertainties on the LHC physics. Emphasis is given to methods of contraining PDF's using LHC data. Moreover, the advantages of the so-called PDF reweighting technique, which enables to quickly estimate PDF uncertainties with Monte Carlo events, are also presented. 
0808.02580	Low-energy magnetic response of the noncentrosymmetric heavy-fermion superconductor CePt3Si studied via inelastic neutron scattering	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:B. Fak, S. Raymond, D. Braithwaite, G. Lapertot, J.-M. Mignot	Abstract:  The low-energy magnetic excitations of the noncentrosymmetric heavy-fermion superconductor CePt3Si have been measured with inelastic neutron scattering on a single crystal. Kondo-type spin fluctuations with an anisotropic wave vector dependence are observed in the paramagnetic state. These fluctuations do not survive in the antiferromagnetically ordered state below TN=2.2 K but are replaced by damped spin waves, whose dispersion is much stronger along the c-axis than in other directions. No change is observed in the excitation spectrum or the magnetic order as the system enters the superconducting state below Tc=0.7 K. 
0808.02581	Separability bounds on multiqubit moments due to positivity under partial transpose	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:A R Usha Devi, A K Rajagopal	Abstract:  Positivity of the density operator reflects itself in terms of sequences of inequalities on observable moments. Uncertainty relations for non-commuting observables form a subset of these inequalities. In addition, criterion of positivity under partial transposition (PPT) imposes distinct bounds on moments, violations of which signal entanglement. We present bounds on some novel sets of composite moments, consequent to positive partial transposition of the density operator and report their violation by entangled multiqubit states. In particular, we derive separability bounds on a multiqubit moment matrix (based on PPT constraints on bipartite divisions of the density matrix) and show that three qubit pure states with non-zero tangle violate these PPT moment constraints. Further, we recover necessary and sufficient condition of separability in a multiqubit Werner state through PPT bounds on moments. 
0808.02582	Muon Charge Ratio of Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Rays	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Bo-Qiang Ma	Abstract:  The muon charge ratio of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays may provide information to detect the composition of the primary cosmic rays. We propose to extract the charge information of high energy muons in very inclined extensive air showers by analyzing their relative lateral positions in the shower transverse plane. 
0808.02583	Colloidal electrophoresis: Scaling analysis, Green-Kubo relation, and numerical results	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:B. Duenweg, V. Lobaskin, K. Seethalakshmy-Hariharan, C. Holm	Abstract:  We consider electrophoresis of a single charged colloidal particle in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions, where added counterions and salt ions ensure charge neutrality. A systematic rescaling of the electrokinetic equations allows us to identify a minimum set of suitable dimensionless parameters, which, within this theoretical framework, determine the reduced electrophoretic mobility. It turns out that the salt-free case can, on the Mean Field level, be described in terms of just three parameters. A fourth parameter, which had previously been identified on the basis of straightforward dimensional analysis, can only be important beyond Mean Field. More complicated behavior is expected to arise when further ionic species are added. However, for a certain parameter regime, we can demonstrate that the salt-free case can be mapped onto a corresponding system containing additional salt. The Green-Kubo formula for the electrophoretic mobility is derived, and its usefulness demonstrated by simulation data. Finally, we report on finite-element solutions of the electrokinetic equations, using the commercial software package COMSOL. 
0808.02584	On Transformations of Load-Store Maurer Instruction Set Architecture	Hardware Architecture (cs.AR)	Authors:Tie Hou	Abstract:  In this paper, we study how certain conditions can affect the transformations on the states of the memory of a strict load-store Maurer ISA, when half of the data memory serves as the part of the operating unit. 
0808.02585	Star cluster evolution in the Magellanic Clouds revisited	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Richard de Grijs (1,2), Simon P. Goodwin (1) ((1) University of Sheffield, UK; (2) NAOC-CAS, Beijing, China)    	Abstract:  The evolution of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds has been the subject of significant recent controversy, particularly regarding the importance and length of the earliest, largely mass-independent disruption phase (referred to as "infant mortality"). Here, we take a fresh approach to the problem, using a large, independent, and homogeneous data set of UBVR imaging observations, from which we obtain the cluster age and mass distributions in both the Large and Small Magelanic Clouds (LMC, SMC) in a self-consistent manner. We conclude that the (optically selected) SMC star cluster population has undergone at most ~30% (1sigma) infant mortality between the age range from about 3-10 Myr, to that of approximately 40-160 Myr. We rule out a 90% cluster mortality rate per decade of age (for the full age range up to 10^9 yr) at a >6sigma level. Using a simple approach, we derive a "characteristic" cluster disruption time-scale for the cluster population in the LMC that implies that we are observing the INITIAL cluster mass function. Preliminary results suggest that the LMC cluster population may be affected by <10% infant mortality. 
0808.02586	Towards Provable Secure Neighbor Discovery in Wireless Networks	Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)	Authors:Marcin Poturalski, Panos Papadimitratos, Jean-Pierre Hubaux	Abstract:  In wireless systems, neighbor discovery (ND) is a fundamental building block: determining which devices are within direct radio communication is an enabler for networking protocols and a wide range of applications. To thwart abuse of ND and the resultant compromise of the dependent functionality of wireless systems, numerous works proposed solutions to secure ND. Nonetheless, until very recently, there has been no formal analysis of secure ND protocols. We close this gap in \cite{asiaccs08}, but we concentrate primarily on the derivation of an impossibility result for a class of protocols. In this paper, we focus on reasoning about specific protocols. First, we contribute a number of extensions and refinements on the framework of [24]. As we are particularly concerned with the practicality of provably secure ND protocols, we investigate availability and redefine accordingly the ND specification, and also consider composability of ND with other protocols. Then, we propose and analyze two secure ND protocols: We revisit one of the protocols analyzed in [24], and introduce and prove correct a more elaborate challenge-response protocol. 
0808.02587	Charm Physics - A Field Full with Challenges and Opportunities	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Xue-Qian Li, Xiang Liu, Zheng-Tao Wei	Abstract:  In this review, we discuss some interesting issues in charm physics which is full with puzzles and challenges. So far in the field there exist many problems which have not obtained satisfactory answers yet and more unexpected phenomena have been observed at the present facilities of high energy physics. Charm physics may become an ideal place for searching new resonances and studying non-perturbative QCD effects, moreover probably is an area to explore new physics beyond the Standard Model. More data will be available at BESIII, B-factories, LHC and even future ILC which may open a wide window to a better understanding of the nature. 
0808.02588	Stickelberger elements and Kolyvagin systems	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Kazim Buyukboduk	Abstract:  In this paper, we construct (many) Kolyvagin systems out of Stickelberger elements, utilizing ideas borrowed from our previous work on Kolyvagin systems of Rubin-Stark elements. We show how to apply this construction to prove results on the odd parts of the ideal class groups of CM fields which are abelian over a totally real field, and deduce the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory for totally real fields (for totally odd characters). Although the main results of this paper have already been established by Wiles, our approach provides another example (which slightly differs from the case of Stark elements) on how to study Kolyvagin systems of core rank r > 1 (in the sense of Mazur and Rubin). Also, by making use of the 'rigidity' of the collection of Kolyvagin systems, we establish a link between the Stickelberger elements and the Rubin-Stark elements. 
0808.02589	Tracking heterogeneous dynamics during the alpha-relaxation of a simple glass-former	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Pinaki Chaudhuri, Srikanth Sastry, Walter Kob	Abstract:  We study the relaxation process in a simple glass-former - the KA lattice gas model. We show that, for this model, structural relaxation is due to slow percolation of regions of co-operatively moving particles, which leads to heterogeneous dynamics of the system. We find that the size distribution of these regions is given by a power-law and that their formation is encoded in the initial structure of the particles, with the memory of initial configuration increasingly retained with increasing density. 
0808.02590	Measuring the Charged Particle Multiplicity with ALICE	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:J. F. Grosse-Oetringhaus	Abstract:  The charged particle multiplicity distribution is one of the first measurements that ALICE will be able to perform. The knowledge of this basic property at a new energy is needed to configure Monte Carlo generators correctly with the aim of understanding the background of other, especially rare, processes including new physics. It allows to study the scaling behaviour and to verify model predictions. The unfolding of the measurement is a non-trivial task due to the finite precision and acceptance of the detector. Solutions are based on chi2 minimization or iteratively using Bayes' theorem. Both approaches to unfold the spectrum are presented. Furthermore, the capabilities of the SPD fast OR trigger are shown that enable physics at very high multiplicities. 
0808.02591	GossiCrypt: Wireless Sensor Network Data Confidentiality Against Parasitic Adversaries	Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)	Authors:Jun Luo, Panos Papadimitratos, Jean-Pierre Hubaux	Abstract:  Resource and cost constraints remain a challenge for wireless sensor network security. In this paper, we propose a new approach to protect confidentiality against a parasitic adversary, which seeks to exploit sensor networks by obtaining measurements in an unauthorized way. Our low-complexity solution, GossiCrypt, leverages on the large scale of sensor networks to protect confidentiality efficiently and effectively. GossiCrypt protects data by symmetric key encryption at their source nodes and re-encryption at a randomly chosen subset of nodes en route to the sink. Furthermore, it employs key refreshing to mitigate the physical compromise of cryptographic keys. We validate GossiCrypt analytically and with simulations, showing it protects data confidentiality with probability almost one. Moreover, compared with a system that uses public-key data encryption, the energy consumption of GossiCrypt is one to three orders of magnitude lower. 
0808.02592	Degree formula for connective K-theory	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:K. Zainoulline	Abstract:  We apply the degree formula for connective $K$-theory to study rational contractions of algebraic varieties. Examples include rationally connected varieties and complete intersections. 
0808.02593	Universal Malliavin Calculus in Fock and Lévy-Itô Spaces	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:David Applebaum	Abstract:  We review and extend Lindsay's work on abstract gradient and divergence operators in Fock space over a general complex Hilbert space. Precise expressions for the domains are given, the $L^2$-equivalence of norms is proved and an abstract version of the Itô-Skorohod isometry is established. We then outline a new proof of Itô's chaos expansion of complex Lévy-Itô space in terms of multiple Wiener-Lévy integrals based on Brownian motion and a compensated Poisson random measure. The duality transform now identifies Lévy-Itô space as a Fock space. We can then easily obtain key properties of the gradient and divergence of a general Lévy process. In particular we establish maximal domains of these operators and obtain the Itô-Skorohod isometry on its maximal domain. 
0808.02594	Faraday waves in elongated superfluid fermionic clouds	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:P. Capuzzi (Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina), P. Vignolo (INLN, Nice, France)    	Abstract:  We use hydrodynamic equations to study the formation of Faraday waves in a superfluid Fermi gas at zero temperature confined in a strongly elongated cigar-shaped trap. First, we treat the role of the radial density profile in the limit of an infinite cylindrical geometry and analytically evaluate the wavelength of the Faraday pattern. The effect of the axial confinement is fully taken into account in the numerical solution of hydrodynamic equations and shows that the infinite cylinder geometry provides a very good description of the phenomena. 
0808.02595	Mirror dark matter discovered?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Z.K. Silagadze	Abstract:  Recent astrophysical data indicates that dark matter shows a controversial behaviour in galaxy cluster collisions. In case of the notorious Bullet cluster, dark matter component of the cluster behaves like a collisionless system. However, its behaviour in the Abell 520 cluster indicates a significant self-interaction cross-section. It is hard for the WIMP based dark matter models to reconcile such a diverse behaviour. Mirror dark matter models, on the contrary, are more flexible and for them diverse behaviour of the dark matter is a natural expectation. 
0808.02596	Parameterized Telescoping Proves Algebraic Independence of Sums	Symbolic Computation (cs.SC)	Authors:Carsten Schneider	Abstract:  Usually creative telescoping is used to derive recurrences for sums. In this article we show that the non-existence of a creative telescoping solution, and more generally, of a parameterized telescoping solution, proves algebraic independence of certain types of sums. Combining this fact with summation-theory shows transcendence of whole classes of sums. Moreover, this result throws new light on the question why, e.g., Zeilberger's algorithm fails to find a recurrence with minimal order. 
0808.02597	IMEX evolution of scalar fields on curved backgrounds	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Stephen R. Lau (1), Harald P. Pfeiffer (2), Jan S. Hesthaven (1) ((1) Brown, (2) Caltech)    	Abstract:  Inspiral of binary black holes occurs over a time-scale of many orbits, far longer than the dynamical time-scale of the individual black holes. Explicit evolutions of a binary system therefore require excessively many time steps to capture interesting dynamics. We present a strategy to overcome the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition in such evolutions, one relying on modern implicit-explicit ODE solvers and multidomain spectral methods for elliptic equations. Our analysis considers the model problem of a forced scalar field propagating on a generic curved background. Nevertheless, we encounter and address a number of issues pertinent to the binary black hole problem in full general relativity. Specializing to the Schwarzschild geometry in Kerr-Schild coordinates, we document the results of several numerical experiments testing our strategy. 
0808.02598	MHV, CSW and BCFW: field theory structures in string theory amplitudes	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Rutger Boels, Kasper J. Larsen, Niels A. Obers, Marcel Vonk	Abstract:  Motivated by recent progress in calculating field theory amplitudes, we study applications of the basic ideas in these developments to the calculation of amplitudes in string theory. We consider in particular both non-Abelian and Abelian open superstring disk amplitudes in a flat space background, focusing mainly on the four-dimensional case. The basic field theory ideas under consideration split into three separate categories. In the first, we argue that the calculation of alpha'-corrections to MHV open string disk amplitudes reduces to the determination of certain classes of polynomials. This line of reasoning is then used to determine the alpha'^3-correction to the MHV amplitude for all multiplicities. A second line of attack concerns the existence of an analog of CSW rules derived from the Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action in four dimensions. We show explicitly that the CSW-like perturbation series of this action is surprisingly trivial: only helicity conserving amplitudes are non-zero. Last but not least, we initiate the study of BCFW on-shell recursion relations in string theory. These should appear very naturally as the UV properties of the string theory are excellent. We show that all open four-point string amplitudes in a flat background at the disk level obey BCFW recursion relations. Based on the naturalness of the proof and some explicit results for the five-point gluon amplitude, it is expected that this pattern persists for all higher point amplitudes and for the closed string. 
0808.02599	Inelastic scattering in a monolayer graphene sheet; a weak-localization study	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Dong-Keun Ki, Dongchan Jeong, Jae-Hyun Choi, Kee-Su Park, Hu-Jong Lee	Abstract:  Charge carriers in a graphene sheet, a single layer of graphite, exhibit much distinctive characteristics to those in other two-dimensional electronic systems because of their chiral nature. In this report, we focus on the observation of weak localization in a graphene sheet exfoliated from a piece of natural graphite and nano-patterned into a Hall-bar geometry. Much stronger chiral-symmetry-breaking elastic intervalley scattering in our graphene sheet restores the conventional weak localization. The resulting carrier-density and temperature dependence of the phase coherence length reveal that the electron-electron interaction including a direct Coulomb interaction is the main inelastic scattering factor while electron-hole puddles enhance the inelastic scattering near the Dirac point. 
0808.02600	Quantum transport through STM-lifted single PTCDA molecules	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Florian Pump, Ruslan Temirov, Olga Neucheva, Serguei Soubatch, Stefan Tautz, Michael Rohlfing, Gianaurelio Cuniberti	Abstract:  Using a scanning tunneling microscope we have measured the quantum conductance through a PTCDA molecule for different configurations of the tip-molecule-surface junction. A peculiar conductance resonance arises at the Fermi level for certain tip to surface distances. We have relaxed the molecular junction coordinates and calculated transport by means of the Landauer/Keldysh approach. The zero bias transmission calculated for fixed tip positions in lateral dimensions but different tip substrate distances show a clear shift and sharpening of the molecular chemisorption level on increasing the STM-surface distance, in agreement with experiment. 
0808.02601	Geodesic Structure of the Schwarzschild Black Hole in Rainbow Gravity	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Carlos Leiva, Joel Saavedra, Jose Villanueva	Abstract:  In this paper we study the geodesic structure of the Schwarzschild black hole in rainbow gravity analyzing the behavior of null and time-like geodesic. We find that the structure of the geodesics essentially does not change when the semi-classical effects are included. However, we can distinguish different scenarios if we take into account the effects of rainbow gravity. Depending on the type of rainbow functions under consideration, inertial and external observers see very different situations in radial and non radial motion of a test particles. 
0808.02602	Easily testable logical networks based on a 'widened long flip-flop'	Hardware Architecture (cs.AR)	Authors:Nick Stukach	Abstract:  The article describes an attempt to solve at once three basic problems arising at testing a complex digital equipment for defects: 1) the problem of an exponential increasing of the complexity of testing the equipment with the complexity of the equipment; 2) the problem of testing of the tester; 3) the problem of a mutual masking of defects. The proposed solution is nothing more than using certain limitations for connections between usual logical gates. Arbitrary multiple stuck-at-faults are supposed as defects. 
0808.02603	Are Optically-Selected Quasars Universally X-Ray Luminous? X-Ray/UV Relations in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Robert R. Gibson, W. N. Brandt, Donald P. Schneider	Abstract:  We analyze archived Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of 536 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5 (DR5) quasars (QSOs) at 1.7 <= z <= 2.7 in order to characterize the relative UV and X-ray spectral properties of QSOs that do not have broad UV absorption lines (BALs). We constrain the fraction of X-ray weak, non-BAL QSOs and find that such objects are rare; for example, sources underluminous by a factor of 10 comprise $\la$2% of optically-selected SDSS QSOs. X-ray luminosities vary with respect to UV emission by a factor of $\la$2 over several years for most sources. UV continuum reddening and the presence of narrow-line absorbing systems are not strongly associated with X-ray weakness in our sample. X-ray brightness is significantly correlated with UV emission line properties, so that relatively X-ray weak, non-BAL QSOs generally have weaker, blueshifted CIV$λ$1549 emission and broader CIII]$λ$1909 lines. The CIV emission line strength depends on both UV and X-ray luminosity, suggesting that the physical mechanism driving the global Baldwin effect is also associated with X-ray emission. 
0808.02604	Quantum groups and quantization of Weyl group symmetries of Painlevé systems	Quantum Algebra (math.QA)	Authors:Gen Kuroki	Abstract:  We shall construct the quantized q-analogues of the birational Weyl group actions arising from nilpotent Poisson algebras, which are conceptual generalizations, proposed by Noumi and Yamada, of the Bäcklund transformations for Painlevé equations. Consider a quotient Ore domain of the lower nilpotent part of a quantized universal enveloping algebra of arbitrary symmetrizable Kac-Moody type. Then non-integral powers of the image of the Chevalley generators generate the quantized q-analogue of the birational Weyl group action. Using the same method, we shall reconstruct the quantized Bäcklund transformations of q-Painlevé equations constructed by Hasegawa. We shall also prove that any subquotient integral domain of a quantized universal enveloping algebra of finite or affine type is an Ore domain. 
0808.02605	Differential Reduction Algorithms for the All-Order Epsilon Expansion of Hypergeometric Functions	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:S.A. Yost, M.Yu. Kalmykov, B.F.L. Ward	Abstract:  Hypergeometric functions provide a useful representation of Feynman diagrams occuring in precision phenomenology. In dimension regularization, the epsilon-expansion of these functions about d=4 is required. We discuss the current status of differential reduction algorithms. As an illustration, we consider the construction of the all-order epsilon-expansion of the Appell hypergeometric function about integer values of the parameters and present an explicit evaluations of the first few terms. 
0808.02606	On the importance of hydrodynamic interactions in polyelectrolyte electrophoresis	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Kai Grass, Christian Holm	Abstract:  The effect of hydrodynamic interactions on the free-solution electrophoresis of polyelectrolytes is investigated with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. By comparing the results to simulations with switched-off hydrodynamic interactions, we demonstrate their importance in modelling the experimentally observed behaviour. In order to quantify the hydrodynamic interactions between the polyelectrolyte and the solution, we present a novel way to estimate its effective charge. We obtain an effective friction that is different from the hydrodynamic friction obtained from diffusion measurements. This effective friction is used to explain the constant electrophoretic mobility for longer chains. To further emphasize the importance of hydrodynamic interactions, we apply the model to end-labeled free-solution electrophoresis. 
0808.02607	Spin-density induced by electromagnetic wave in two-dimensional electron gas with both Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Mikhail Pletyukhov, Alexander Shnirman	Abstract:  We consider the magnetic response of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with both Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling to a microwave excitation. We generalize the results of [A. Shnirman and I. Martin, Europhys. Lett. 78, 27001 (2007).], where pure Rashba coupling was studied. We observe that the microwave with the in-plane electric field and the out-of-plane magnetic field creates an out-of-plane spin polarization. The effect is more prominent in clean systems with resolved spin-orbit-split subbands. Considered as response to the microwave magnetic field, the spin-orbit contribution to the magnetization far exceeds the usual Zeeman contribution in the clean limit. The effect vanishes when the Rashba and the Dresselhaus couplings have equal strength. 
0808.02608	Edge scaling limits for a family of non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Martin Bender	Abstract:  A family of random matrix ensembles interpolating between the GUE and the Ginibre ensemble of $n\times n$ matrices with iid centered complex Gaussian entries is considered. The asymptotic spectral distribution in these models is uniform in an ellipse in the complex plane, which collapses to an interval of the real line as the degree of non-Hermiticity diminishes. Scaling limit theorems are proven for the eigenvalue point process at the rightmost edge of the spectrum, and it is shown that a non-trivial transition occurs between Poisson and Airy point process statistics when the ratio of the axes of the supporting ellipse is of order $n^{-1/3}$. In this regime, the family of limiting probability distributions of the maximum of the real parts of the eigenvalues interpolates between the Gumbel and Tracy-Widom distributions. 
0808.02609	A new line element derived from the variable rest mass in gravitational field	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:N. Ben-Amots	Abstract:  This paper presents a new line element based on the assumption of the variable rest mass in gravitational field, and explores some its implications. This line element is not a vacuum solution of Einstein's equations, yet it is sufficiently close to Schwarzschild's line element to be compatible with all of the experimental and observational measurements made so far to confirm the three Einstein's predictions. The theory allows radiation and fast particles to escape from all massive bodies, even from those that in Einstein's general relativity framework will be black holes. The striking feature of this line element is the non-existence of black holes. 
0808.02610	GRB 070714B - Discovery of the Highest Spectroscopically Confirmed Short Burst Redshift	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. F. Graham (1 and 2), A. S. Fruchter (1), A. J. Levan (3), A. Melandri (4), L. J. Kewley (5), E. M. Levesque (5), M. Nysewander (1), N. R. Tanvir (6), T. Dahlen (1), D. Bersier (4), K. Wiersema (6), D. G. Bonfield (7), A. Martinez-Sansigre (8) ((1) Space Telescope Science Institute, (2) Johns Hopkins University, (3) University of Warwick, (4) Liverpool John Moores University, (5) University of Hawaii, (6) University of Leicester, (7) NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, (8) Max Planck Institute for Astronomy)    	Abstract:  We detect the optical afterglow and host galaxy of GRB 070714B. Our observations of the afterglow show an initial plateau in the lightcurve for approximately the first 5 to 25 minutes, then steepening to a powerlaw decay with index alpha= 0.86 +/- 0.10 for the period between 1 to 24 hours post burst. This is consistent with the X-ray light-curve which shows an initial plateau followed by a similar subsequent decay. At late time, we detect a host galaxy at the location of the optical transient. Gemini Nod & Shuffle spectroscopic observations of the host show a single emission line at 7167 angstroms which, based on a grizJHK photometric redshift, we conclude is the 3727 angstrom [O II] line. We therefore find a redshift of z=0.923. This redshift, as well as a subsequent probable spectroscopic redshift determination of GRB 070429B at z=0.904 by two other groups, significantly exceeds the previous highest spectroscopically confirmed short burst redshift of z=0.546 for GRB 051221. This dramatically moves back the time at which we know short bursts were being formed, and suggests that the present evidence for an old progenitor population may be observationally biased. 
0808.02611	The Evolution of L and T Dwarfs in Color-Magnitude Diagrams	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:D. Saumon (1), M. S. Marley (2) ((1) Lanl, (2) NASA Ames)    	Abstract:  We present new evolution sequences for very low mass stars, brown dwarfs and giant planets and use them to explore a variety of influences on the evolution of these objects. We compare our results with previous work and discuss the causes of the differences and argue for the importance of the surface boundary condition provided by atmosphere models including clouds. The L- to T-type ultracool dwarf transition can be accommodated within the Ackerman & Marley (2001) cloud model by varying the cloud sedimentation parameter. We develop a simple model for the evolution across the L/T transition. By combining the evolution calculation and our atmosphere models, we generate colors and magnitudes of synthetic populations of ultracool dwarfs in the field and in galactic clusters. We focus on near infrared color- magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and on the nature of the ``second parameter'' that is responsible for the scatter of colors along the Teff sequence. Variations in metallicity and cloud parameters, unresolved binaries and possibly a relatively young population all play a role in defining the spread of brown dwarfs along the cooling sequence. We find that the transition from cloudy L dwarfs to cloudless T dwarfs slows down the evolution and causes a pile up of substellar objects in the transition region, in contradiction with previous studies. We apply the same model to the Pleiades brown dwarf sequence. Taken at face value, the Pleiades data suggest that the L/T transition occurs at lower Teff for lower gravity objects. The simulated populations of brown dwarfs also reveal that the phase of deuterium burning produces a distinctive feature in CMDs that should be detectable in ~50-100 Myr old clusters. 
0808.02612	Uniformly Rotating Homogeneous and Polytropic Rings in Newtonian Gravity	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:David Petroff, Stefan Horatschek	Abstract:  An analytical method is presented for treating the problem of a uniformly rotating, self-gravitating ring without a central body in Newtonian gravity. The method is based on an expansion about the thin ring limit, where the cross-section of the ring tends to a circle. The iterative scheme developed here is applied to homogeneous rings up to the 20th order and to polytropes with the index n=1 up to the third order. For other polytropic indices no analytic solutions are obtainable, but one can apply the method numerically. However, it is possible to derive a simple formula relating mass to the integrated pressure to leading order without specifying the equation of state. Our results are compared with those generated by highly accurate numerical methods to test their accuracy. 
0808.02613	Effective particle kinematics from Quantum Gravity	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Jerzy Kowalski-Glikman, Artem Starodubtsev	Abstract:  Particles propagating in de Sitter spacetime can be described by the topological BF $\SO(4,1)$ theory coupled to point charges. Gravitational interaction between them can be introduced by adding to the action a symmetry breaking term, which reduces the local gauge symmetry down to $\SO(3,1)$, and which can be treated as a perturbation. In this paper we focus solely on topological interactions which corresponds to zeroth order in this perturbative expansion. We show that in this approximation the system is effectively described by the $\SO(4,1)$ Chern-Simons theory coupled to particles and living on the 3 dimensional boundary of space-time. Then, using Alekseev--Malkin construction we find the effective theory of particles kinematics. We show that the particles action contains standard kinetic terms and the deformation shows up in the presence of interaction terms. The strength of the interactions is proportional to deformation parameter, identified with Planck mass scale. 
0808.02614	On Bogovski\uı and regularized Poincaré integral operators for de Rham complexes on Lipschitz domains	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Martin Costabel (IRMAR), Alan McIntosh (CMA)    	Abstract:  We study integral operators related to a regularized version of the classical Poincaré path integral and the adjoint class generalizing Bogovski\uı's integral operator, acting on differential forms in $R^n$. We prove that these operators are pseudodifferential operators of order -1. The Poincaré-type operators map polynomials to polynomials and can have applications in finite element analysis. For a domain starlike with respect to a ball, the special support properties of the operators imply regularity for the de Rham complex without boundary conditions (using Poincaré-type operators) and with full Dirichlet boundary conditions (using Bogovski\uı-type operators). For bounded Lipschitz domains, the same regularity results hold, and in addition we show that the cohomology spaces can always be represented by $C^\infty$ functions. 
0808.02615	Dual mapping between the antisymmetric tensor matter field and the Kalb-Ramond field	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:L. Gonzaga Filho, M. S. Cunha, R. R. Landim	Abstract:  In this work we present a dual mapping between the Kalb-Ramond and antisymmetric tensor matter (ATM) field actions. Our procedure shows that the correlation functions associated with both the Noether current and the topological current are equivalent. 
0808.02616	Hadronic Final States and QCD: Summary	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Thomas Gehrmann, Guenter Grindhammer, Vivian O'Dell, Roman Walczak	Abstract:  A summary of new experimental results and recent theoretical developments discussed in the "Hadronic Final States and QCD" working group is presented. 
0808.02617	On the non-integrability of the Popowicz peakon system	Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)	Authors:Andrew N.W. Hone, Michael V. Irle	Abstract:  We consider a coupled system of Hamiltonian partial differential equations introduced by Popowicz, which has the appearance of a two-field coupling between the Camassa-Holm and Degasperis-Procesi equations. The latter equations are both known to be integrable, and admit peaked soliton (peakon) solutions with discontinuous derivatives at the peaks. A combination of a reciprocal transformation with Painlevé analysis provides strong evidence that the Popowicz system is non-integrable. Nevertheless, we are able to construct exact travelling wave solutions in terms of an elliptic integral, together with a degenerate travelling wave corresponding to a single peakon. We also describe the dynamics of N-peakon solutions, which is given in terms of an Hamiltonian system on a phase space of dimension 3N. 
0808.02618	Explicit double shuffle relations and a generalization of Euler's decomposition formula	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Li Guo, Bingyong Xie	Abstract:  We give an explicit formula for the shuffle relation in a general double shuffle framework that specializes to double shuffle relations of multiple zeta values and multiple polylogarithms. As an application, we generalize the well-known decomposition formula of Euler that expresses the product of two Riemann zeta values as a sum of double zeta values to a formula that expresses the product of two multiple polylogarithm values as a sum of other multiple polylogarithm values. 
0808.02619	Characterizations of discrete Sugeno integrals as polynomial functions over distributive lattices	Rings and Algebras (math.RA)	Authors:Miguel Couceiro, Jean-Luc Marichal	Abstract:  We give several characterizations of discrete Sugeno integrals over bounded distributive lattices, as particular cases of lattice polynomial functions, that is, functions which can be represented in the language of bounded lattices using variables and constants. We also consider the subclass of term functions as well as the classes of symmetric polynomial functions and weighted minimum and maximum functions, and present their characterizations, accordingly. Moreover, we discuss normal form representations of these functions. 
0808.02620	Density-matrix renormalization group methods for momentum- and frequency-resolved dynamical correlation functions	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Eric Jeckelmann	Abstract:  Several density-matrix renormalization group methods have been proposed to compute the momentum- and frequency-resolved dynamical correlation functions of low-dimensional strongly correlated systems. The most relevant approaches are discussed in this contribution. Their applications in various studies of quasi-one-dimensional strongly correlated systems (spin chains, itinerant electron systems, electron-phonon systems) are reviewed. 
0808.02621	Magnetization and spin dynamics of a Cr-based magnetic cluster: Cr$_{7}$Ni	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:A. Bianchi, S. Carretta, P. Santini, G. Amoretti, Y. Furukawa, K. Kiuchi, Y. Ajiro, Y. Narumi, K. Kindo, J. Lago, E. Micotti, P. Arosio, A. Lascialfari, F. Borsa, G. Timco, R. E. P. Winpenny	Abstract:  We study the magnetization and the spin dynamics of the Cr$_7$Ni ring-shaped magnetic cluster. Measurements of the magnetization at high pulsed fields and low temperature are compared to calculations and show that the spin Hamiltonian approach provides a good description of Cr$_7$Ni magnetic molecule. In addition, the phonon-induced relaxation dynamics of molecular observables has been investigated. By assuming the spin-phonon coupling to take place through the modulation of the local crystal fields, it is possible to evaluate the decay of fluctuations of two generic molecular observables. The nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ directly probes such fluctuations, and allows to determine the magnetoelastic coupling strength. 
0808.02622	On the photofragmentation of SF$_2^+$: Experimental evidence for a predissociation channel	Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)	Authors:Qun Zhang, Rui Mao, Yang Chen	Abstract:  We report on the first observation of the photofragmentation dynamics of SF$_2^+$. With the aid of state-of-the-art ab initio calculations on the low-lying excited cationic states of SF$_2^+$ performed by Lee et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 125, 104304 (2006)], a predissociation channel of SF$_2^+$ is evidenced by means of resonance-enhanced multilphoton ionization spectroscopy. This work represents a second experimental investigation on the low-lying excited cationic states of SF$_2^+$. [The first one is the He I photoelectron spectrum of SF$_2^+$ reported by de Leeuw et al. three decades ago, see Chem. Phys. 34, 287 (1978).] 
0808.02623	Diffeomorphism Invariance in the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:N. Kiriushcheva, S.V. Kuzmin, C. Racknor, S.R. Valluri	Abstract:  It is shown that when the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian is considered without any non-covariant modifications or change of variables, its Hamiltonian formulation leads to results consistent with principles of General Relativity. The first-class constraints of such a Hamiltonian formulation, with the metric tensor taken as a canonical variable, allow one to derive the generator of gauge transformations, which directly leads to diffeomorphism invariance. The given Hamiltonian formulation preserves general covariance of the transformations derivable from it. This characteristic should be used as the crucial consistency requirement that must be met by any Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity. 
0808.02624	Is there a Supermassive Black Hole at the Center of the Milky Way?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Mark J. Reid (1) ((1)Harvard--Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)    	Abstract:  This review outlines the observations that now provide an overwhelming scientific case that the center of our Milky Way Galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole. Observations at infrared wavelength trace stars that orbit about a common focal position and require a central mass (M) of 4 million solar masses within a radius of 100 Astronomical Units. Orbital speeds have been observed to exceed 5,000 km/s. At the focal position there is an extremely compact radio source (Sgr A*), whose apparent size is near the Schwarzschild radius (2GM/c^2). This radio source is motionless at the ~1 km/s level at the dynamical center of the Galaxy. The mass density required by these observations is now approaching the ultimate limit of a supermassive black hole within the last stable orbit for matter near the event horizon. 
0808.02625	Inclusive inelastic electron scattering from nuclei	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:Nadia Fomin	Abstract:  Inclusive electron scattering from nuclei at large x and $Q^2$ is the result of a reaction mechanism that includes both quasi--elastic scattering from nucleons and deep inelastic scattering from the quark constituents of the nucleons. Data in this regime can be used to study a wide variety of topics, including the extraction of nuclear momentum distributions, the influence of final state interactions and the approach to $y$-scaling, the strength of nucleon-nucleon correlations, and the approach to $x$- scaling, to name a few. Selected results from the recent experiment E02-019 at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility will be shown and their relevance discussed. 
0808.02626	Gromov-Witten theory of orbicurves, the space of tri-polynomials and Symplectic Field Theory of Seifert fibrations	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Paolo Rossi	Abstract:  We compute, with Symplectic Field Theory techniques, the Gromov-Witten theory of the complex projective line with orbifold points. A natural subclass of these orbifolds, the ones with polynomial quantum cohomology, gives rise to a family of (polynomial) Frobenius manifolds and integrable systems of Hamiltonian PDEs, which extend the (dispersionless) bigraded Toda hierarchy. We then define a Frobenius structure on the spaces of polynomials in three complex variables of the form F(x,y,z)= -xyz+P_1(x)+P_2(y)+P_3(z) which contains as special cases the ones constructed on the space of Laurent polynomials. We prove a mirror theorem stating that these Frobenius structures are isomorphic to the ones found before for polynomial P1-orbifolds. Finally we link rational Symplectic Field Theory of Seifert fibrations over S^2 and three singular fibers with orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants of the base, extending a known result valid in the smooth case. 
0808.02627	Subleading and non-holomorphic corrections to N=2 BPS black hole entropy	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:G. L. Cardoso, B. de Wit, S. Mahapatra	Abstract:  BPS black hole degeneracies can be expressed in terms of an inverse Laplace transform of a partition function based on a mixed electric/magnetic ensemble, which involves a non-trivial integration measure. This measure has been evaluated for black holes with various degrees of supersymmetry and for N=4 supersymmetric black holes all results agree. It generally receives contributions from non-holomorphic corrections. An explicit evaluation of these corrections in the context of the effective action of the FHSV model reveals that these are related to, but quantitatively different from, the non-holomorphic corrections to the topological string, indicating that the relation between the twisted partition functions of the latter and the effective action is more subtle than has so far been envisaged. The effective action result leads to a duality invariant BPS free energy and arguments are presented for the existence of consistent non-holomorphic deformations of special geometry that can account for these effects. A prediction is given for the measure based on semiclassical arguments for a class of N=2 black holes. Furthermore an attempt is made to confront some of the results of this paper to a recent proposal for the microstate degeneracies of the STU model. 
0808.02628	Liberation of orthogonal Lie groups	Quantum Algebra (math.QA)	Authors:Teodor Banica, Roland Speicher	Abstract:  We show that under suitable assumptions, we have a one-to-one correspondence between classical groups and free quantum groups, in the compact orthogonal case. We classify the groups under correspondence, with the result that there are exactly 6 of them: $O_n,S_n,H_n,B_n,S_n',B_n'$. We investigate the representation theory aspects of the correspondence, with the result that for $O_n,S_n,H_n,B_n$, this is compatible with the Bercovici-Pata bijection. Finally, we discuss some more general classification problems in the compact orthogonal case, notably with the construction of a new quantum group. 
0808.02629	Open-chain transfer matrices for AdS/CFT	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Rajan Murgan, Rafael I. Nepomechie	Abstract:  We extend Sklyanin's construction of commuting open-chain transfer matrices to the SU(2|2) bulk and boundary S-matrices of AdS/CFT. Using the graded version of the S-matrices leads to a transfer matrix of particularly simple form. We also find an SU(1|1) boundary S-matrix which has one free boundary parameter. 
0808.02630	Identification of the TW Hya Association member 2M1235$-$39: a tertiary component of the HR 4796 system	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Joel H. Kastner (Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Grenoble and Rochester Institute of Technology), B. Zuckerman (University of California, Los Angeles), M. Bessell (Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, The Australian National University)    	Abstract:  The association of the late-type star 2MASS J12354893-3950245 (2M1235-39) with a bright X-ray source detected serendipitously by ROSAT and XMM-Newton, combined with its proximity to the well-studied (A+M binary) system HR 4796, suggests this star is a member of the TW Hya Association (TWA). To test this hypothesis, we used optical spectroscopy to establish the Li and H-alpha line strengths and spectral type of 2M1235-39, and determined its proper motion via optical imaging. The Li absorption and H-alpha emission line strengths of 2M1235-39, its near-IR and X-ray fluxes, and its proper motion all indicate that 2M1235-39 is a TWA member. Most likely this star is a wide (13,500 AU) separation, low-mass (M4.5), tertiary component of the HR 4796 system. 
0808.02631	On the Stability of Black Holes at the LHC	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:M. D. Maia, E. M. Monte	Abstract:  The eventual production of mini black holes by proton-proton collisions at the LHC is predicted by theories with large extra dimensions resolvable at the Tev scale of energies. It is expected that these black holes evaporate shortly after its production as a consequence of the Hawking radiation. We show that for theories based on the ADS/CFT correspondence, the produced black holes may have an unstable horizon, which grows proportionally to the square of the distance to the collision point. 
0808.02632	Quantum-entanglement aspects of polaron systems	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Vladimir M. Stojanovic, Mihajlo Vanevic	Abstract:  We describe quantum entanglement inherent to the polaron ground states of coupled electron-phonon (or, more generally, particle-phonon) systems based on a model comprising both local (Holstein-type) and nonlocal (Peierls-type) coupling. We study this model using a variational method supplemented by the exact numerical diagonalization on a system of finite size. By way of subsequent numerical diagonalization of the reduced density matrix, we determine the particle-phonon entanglement as given by the von Neumann and linear entropies. Our results are strongly indicative of the intimate relationship between the particle localization/delocalization and the particle-phonon entanglement. In particular, we find a compelling evidence for the existence of a nonanalyticity in the entanglement entropies with respect to the Peierls-coupling strength. The occurrence of such nonanalyticity -- not accompanied by an actual quantum phase transition -- reinforces analogous conclusion drawn in several recent studies of entanglement in the realm of quantum-dissipative systems. In addition, we demonstrate that the entanglement entropies saturate inside the self-trapped region where the small-polaron states are nearly maximally mixed. 
0808.02633	Towards real-time community detection in large networks	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:Ian X.Y. Leung, Pan Hui, Pietro Lio', Jon Crowcroft	Abstract:  The recent boom of large-scale Online Social Networks (OSNs) both enables and necessitates the use of parallelisable and scalable computational techniques for their analysis. We examine the problem of real-time community detection and a recently proposed linear time - O(m) on a network with m edges - label propagation or "epidemic" community detection algorithm. We identify characteristics and drawbacks of the algorithm and extend it by incorporating different heuristics to facilitate reliable and multifunctional real-time community detection. With limited computational resources, we employ the algorithm on OSN data with 1 million nodes and about 58 million directed edges. Experiments and benchmarks reveal that the extended algorithm is not only faster but its community detection accuracy is compared favourably over popular modularity-gain optimization algorithms known to suffer from their resolution limits. 
0808.02634	A connection between the stochastic heat equation and fractional Brownian motion, and a simple proof of a result of Talagrand	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Carl Mueller, Zhixin Wu	Abstract:  We give a new representation of fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H<=1/2 using stochastic partial differential equations. This representation allows us to use the Markov property and time reversal, tools which are not usually available for fractional Brownian motion. We then give simple proofs that fractional Brownian motion does not hit points in the critical dimension, and that it does not have double points in the critical dimension. These facts were already known, but our proofs are quite simple and use some ideas of Levy. 
0808.02635	The Laguerre polynomials preserve real-rootedness	History and Overview (math.HO)	Authors:Steve Fisk	Abstract:  The linear transformation that sends $x^n$ to the n'th Laguerre polynomial preserves real-rootedness. 
0808.02636	Basin boundary, edge of chaos, and edge state in a two-dimensional model	Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)	Authors:J. Vollmer, T. M. Schneider, B. Eckhardt	Abstract:  In shear flows like pipe flow and plane Couette flow there is an extended range of parameters where linearly stable laminar flow coexists with a transient turbulent dynamics. When increasing the amplitude of a perturbation on top of the laminar flow, one notes a a qualitative change in its lifetime, from smoothly varying and short one on the laminar side to sensitively dependent on initial conditions and long on the turbulent side. The point of transition defines a point on the edge of chaos. Since it is defined via the lifetimes, the edge of chaos can also be used in situations when the turbulence is not persistent. It then generalises the concept of basin boundaries, which separate two coexisting attractors, to cases where the dynamics on one side shows transient chaos and almost all trajectories eventually end up on the other side. In this paper we analyse a two-dimensional map which captures many of the features identified in laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations of hydrodynamic flows. The analysis of the map shows that different dynamical situations in the edge of chaos can be combined with different dynamical situations in the turbulent region. Consequently, the model can be used to develop and test further characterisations that are also applicable to realistic flows. 
0808.02637	Operator-valued Fourier multipliers in Besov spaces and its applications	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Veli Shakhmurov, Rishad Shahmurov	Abstract:  The present paper, is devoted to investigation of operator--valued Fourier multiplier theorems from $B_{q_{1},r}^{s}$ to $B_{q_{2},r}^{s}$, optimal embedding of Besov spaces, the separability and positivity of differential operators. Here, we show that these differential operators generate analytic semigroup. 
0808.02638	Scanning tunneling microscopy study of the CeTe3 charge density wave	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:A. Tomic, Zs. Rak, J. P. Veazey, S. D. Mahanti, S. H. Tessmer, C. D. Malliakas, M. G. Kanatzidis	Abstract:  We have studied the nature of the surface charge distribution in CeTe3. This is a simple, cleavable, layered material with a robust one-dimensional incommensurate charge density wave (CDW). Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has been applied on the exposed surface of a cleaved single crystal. At 77 K, the STM images show both the atomic lattice of surface Te atoms arranged in a square net and the CDW modulations oriented at 45 degrees with respect to the Te net. Fourier transform of the STM data shows Te square lattice peaks, and peaks related to the CDW oriented at 45 degrees to the lattice peaks. In addition, clear peaks are present, consistent with subsurface structure and wave vector mixing effects. These data are supported by electronic structure calculations, which show that the subsurface signal most likely arises from a lattice of Ce atoms situated 2.53 angstroms below the surface Te net. 
0808.02639	Nonclassical Correlation of Polarization Entangled Photons in a Biexciton-Exciton Cascade	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Sumanta Das, G.S. Agarwal	Abstract:  We develop a theoretical model to study the Intensity-Intensity correlation of polarization entangled photons emitted in a biexciton-exciton cascade. We calculate the degree of correlation and show how polarization correlation are affected by the presence of dephasing and energy level splitting of the excitonic states. Our theoretical calculations are in agreement with the recent observation of polarization dependent Intensity-Intensity correlations from a single semiconductor quantum dot [R. M. Stevenson et. al., Nature 439, 179 (2006)] . Our model can be extended to study polarization entangled photon emission in coupled quantum dot systems. 
0808.02640	Galaxy populations in the Antlia cluster. II. Compact elliptical galaxy candidates	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Analia V. Smith Castelli, Favio R. Faifer, Tom Richtler, Lilia P. Bassino	Abstract:  We present a photometric analysis of four galaxies classified as compact elliptical (cE) galaxies in the FS90 Antlia Group catalogue. Only 6 members of this rare type of galaxies are known until now. Using data in various photometric systems, we measured brightness and colour profiles, as well as structural parameters. By comparing them with those of other galaxies in the Antlia cluster, as well as with confirmed cE galaxies from the literature, we found that two of the FS90 cE candidates, albeit being spectroscopically confirmed Antlia members, are not cE galaxies. However, one of these objects presents strong ellipticity and position angle variations that resemble those already reported for M32, leading us to speculate about this kind of objects being progenitors of cE galaxies. The other two FS90 cE candidates, for which radial velocities are not available, match some features typical of cE galaxies like being close in projection to a larger galaxy, displaying flat colour profiles, and having a high degree of compactness. Only one of the remaining cE candidates shows a high central surface brightness, two components in its brightness profile, distinct changes in ellipticity and position angle where the outer component begins to dominate, and seems to follow the same trend as other confirmed cE galaxies in a luminosity versus mean effective surface brightness diagram. Moreover, it shows a distorted inner structure with similar characteristics to those found by simulations of interacting galaxies, and an extremely faint structure that seems to link this object with one of the Antlia dominant galaxies, has been detected in MOSAIC-CTIO, FORS1-VLT, and ACS-HST images. The cE nature of this galaxy as well as the possible interaction with its bright companion, still have to be confirmed through spectroscopy. 
0808.02641	Fitting the Gamma-Ray Spectrum from Dark Matter with DMFIT: GLAST and the Galactic Center Region	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Tesla E. Jeltema, Stefano Profumo	Abstract:  We study the potential of GLAST to unveil particle dark matter properties with gamma-ray observations of the Galactic center region. We present full GLAST simulations including all gamma-ray sources known to date in a region of 4 degrees around the Galactic center, in addition to the diffuse gamma-ray background and to the dark matter signal. We introduce DMFIT, a tool that allows one to fit gamma-ray emission from pair-annihilation of generic particle dark matter models and to extract information on the mass, normalization and annihilation branching ratios into Standard Model final states. We assess the impact and systematic effects of background modeling and theoretical priors on the reconstruction of dark matter particle properties. Our detailed simulations demonstrate that for some well motivated supersymmetric dark matter setups with one year of GLAST data it will be possible not only to significantly detect a dark matter signal over background, but also to estimate the dark matter mass and its dominant pair-annihilation mode. 
0808.02642	Structure and star formation in galaxies out to z=3: evidence for surface density dependent evolution and upsizing	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Marijn Franx, Pieter G. van Dokkum, Natascha M. Foerster Schreiber, Stijn Wuyts, Ivo Labbe, Sune Toft	Abstract:  We present an analysis of galaxies in the CDF-South. We find a tight relation to z=3 between color and size at a given mass, with red galaxies being small, and blue galaxies being large. We show that the relation is driven by stellar surface density or inferred velocity dispersion: galaxies with high surface density are red and have low specific star formation rates, and galaxies with low surface density are blue and have high specific star formation rates. Surface density and inferred velocity dispersion are better correlated with specific star formation rate and color than stellar mass. Hence stellar mass by itself is not a good predictor of the star formation history of galaxies. In general, galaxies at a given surface density have higher specific star formation rates at higher redshift. Specifically, galaxies with a surface density of 1-3 10^9 Msun/kpc^2 are "red and dead" at low redshift, approximately 50% are forming stars at z=1, and almost all are forming stars by z=2. This provides direct additional evidence for the late evolution of galaxies onto the red sequence. The sizes of galaxies at a given mass evolve like 1/(1+z)^(0.59 +- 0.10). Hence galaxies undergo significant upsizing in their history. The size evolution is fastest for the highest mass galaxies, and quiescent galaxies. The persistence of the structural relations from z=0 to z=2.5, and the upsizing of galaxies imply that a relation analogous to the Hubble sequence exists out to z=2.5, and possibly beyond. The star forming galaxies at z >= 1.5 are quite different from star forming galaxies at z=0, as they have likely very high gas fractions, and star formation time scales comparable to the orbital time. 
0808.02643	Ubiquitous Water Masers in Nearby Star-Forming Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jeremy Darling (University of Colorado), Crystal Brogan (NRAO), Kelsey Johnson (University of Virginia and NRAO)    	Abstract:  We report the detection of water maser emission from four nearby galaxies hosting ultradense HII (UDHII) regions, He 2-10, the Antennae galaxies (NGC 4038/4039), NGC 4214, and NGC 5253, with the Green Bank Telescope. Our detection rate is 100%, and all of these H2O "kilomasers" (L(H2O) < 10 L_sun) are located toward regions of known star formation as traced by UDHII regions and bright 24 micron emission. Some of the newly discovered H2O masers have luminosities 1-2 orders of magnitude less than previous extragalactic studies and the same order of magnitude as those typical of Galactic massive star-forming regions. The unusual success of this minisurvey suggests that H2O maser emission may be very common in starburst galaxies, and the paucity of detections to date is due to a lack of sufficient sensitivity. While the galaxy sample was selected by the presence of UDHII regions, and the UDHII regions lie within the telescope beam, in the absence of H2O spectral line maps the connection between H2O masers and UDHII regions has not yet been demonstrated. 
0808.02644	A discontinuity in the low-mass IMF - the case of high multiplicity	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:I. Thies, P. Kroupa	Abstract:  The empirical binary properties of brown dwarfs (BDs) differ from those of normal stars suggesting BDs form a separate population. Recent work by Thies & Kroupa revealed a discontinuity of the initial mass function (IMF) in the very-low-mass star regime under the assumption of a low multiplicity of BDs of about 15 per cent. However, previous observations had suggested that the multiplicity of BDs may be significantly higher, up to 45 per cent. This contribution investigates the implication of a high BD multiplicity on the appearance of the IMF for the Orion Nebula Cluster, Taurus-Auriga, IC 348 and the Pleiades. We show that the discontinuity remains pronounced even if the observed MF appears to be continuous, even for a BD binary fraction as high as 60%. We find no evidence for a variation of the BD IMF with star-forming conditions. The BD IMF has a power-law index alpha = +0.3 and about two BDs form per 10 low-mass stars assuming equal-mass pairing of BDs. 
0808.02645	DLA kinematics and outflows from starburst galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Alexei O. Razoumov (Saint Mary's University, Halifax)    	Abstract:  We present results from a numerical study of the multiphase interstellar medium in sub-Lyman-break galaxy protogalactic clumps. Such clumps are abundant at z=3 and are thought to be a major contributor to damped Ly-alpha absorption. We model the formation of winds from these clumps and show that during star formation episodes they feature outflows with neutral gas velocity widths up to several hundred km/s. Such outflows are consistent with the observed high-velocity dispersion in DLAs. In our models thermal energy feedback from winds and supernovae results in efficient outflows only when cold (~ 300 K), dense (> 100 msun/pc^3) clouds are resolved at grid resolution of 12 pc. At lower 24 pc resolution the first signs of the multiphase medium are spotted; however, at this low resolution thermal injection of feedback energy cannot yet create hot expanding bubbles around star-forming regions -- instead feedback tends to erase high-density peaks and suppress star formation. At 12 pc resolution feedback compresses cold clouds, often without disrupting the ongoing star formation; at the same time a larger fraction of feedback energy is channeled into low-density bubbles and winds. These winds often entrain compact neutral clumps which produce multi-component metal absorption lines. 
0808.02646	Can entropy save bacteria?	Subcellular Processes (q-bio.SC)	Authors:Suckjoon Jun	Abstract:  This article presents a physical biology approach to understanding organization and segregation of bacterial chromosomes. The author uses a "piston" analogy for bacterial chromosomes in a cell, which leads to a phase diagram for the organization of two athermal chains confined in a closed geometry characterized by two length scales (length and width). When applied to rod-shaped bacteria such as Escherichia coli, this phase diagram predicts that, despite strong confinement, duplicated chromosomes will demix, i.e., there exists a primordial physical driving force for chromosome segregation. The author discusses segregation of duplicating chromosomes using the concentric-shell model, which predicts that newly synthesized DNA will be found in the periphery of the chromosome during replication. In contrast to chromosomes, these results suggest that most plasmids will be randomly distributed inside the cell because of their small sizes. An active partitioning system is therefore required for accurate segregation of low-copy number plasmids. Implications of these results are also sketched, e.g., on the role of proteins, segregation mechanisms for bacteria of diverse shapes, cell cycle of an artificial cell, and evolution. 
0808.02647	Berry Phase and the Breakdown of the Quantum to Classical Mapping for the Quantum Critical Point of the Bose-Fermi Kondo model	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Stefan Kirchner, Qimiao Si	Abstract:  The phase diagram of the Bose-Fermi Kondo model contains an SU(2)-invariant Kondo-screened phase separated by a continuous quantum phase transition from a Kondo-destroyed local moment phase. We analyze the effect of the Berry phase term of the spin path integral on the quantum critical properties of this quantum impurity model. For a range of the power-law exponent characterizing the spectral density of the dissipative bosonic bath, neglecting the influence of the Berry phase term makes the fixed point Gaussian. For the same range of the spectral density exponent, incorporating the Berry phase term leads instead to an interacting fixed point, for which a quantum to classical mapping breaks down. Some general implications of our results are discussed. 
0808.02648	The Extended Star Formation History of the Andromeda Spheroid at 35 Kpc on the Minor Axis	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Thomas M. Brown, Rachael Beaton, Masashi Chiba, Henry C. Ferguson, Karoline M. Gilbert, Puragra Guhathakurta, Masanori Iye, Jasonjot S. Kalirai, Andreas Koch, Yutaka Komiyama, Steven R. Majewski, David B. Reitzel, Alvio Renzini, R. Michael Rich, Ed Smith, Allen V. Sweigart, Mikito Tanaka	Abstract:  Using the HST ACS, we have obtained deep optical images reaching well below the oldest main sequence turnoff in fields on the southeast minor-axis of the Andromeda Galaxy, 35 kpc from the nucleus. These data probe the star formation history in the extended halo of Andromeda -- that region beyond 30 kpc that appears both chemically and morphologically distinct from the metal-rich, highly-disturbed inner spheroid. The present data, together with our previous data for fields at 11 and 21 kpc, do not show a simple trend toward older ages and lower metallicities, as one might expect for populations further removed from the obvious disturbances of the inner spheroid. Specifically, the mean ages and [Fe/H] values at 11 kpc, 21 kpc, and 35 kpc are 9.7 Gyr and -0.65, 11.0 Gyr and -0.87, and 10.5 Gyr and -0.98, respectively. In the best-fit model of the 35 kpc population, one third of the stars are younger than 10 Gyr, while only ~10% of the stars are truly ancient and metal-poor. The extended halo thus exhibits clear evidence of its hierarchical assembly, and the contribution from any classical halo formed via early monolithic collapse must be small. 
0808.02649	Numerical Simulation of Particle Flow in a Sand Trap	Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)	Authors:A. D. Araújo, J. S. Andrade Jr., L. P. Maia, H. J. Herrmann	Abstract:  Sand traps are used to measure Aeolian flux. Since they modify the surrounding wind velocity field their gauging represents an important challenge. We use numerical simulations under the assumption of homogeneous turbulence based on FLUENT to systematically study the flow field and trapping efficiency of one of the most common devices based on a hollow cylinder with two slits. In particular, we investigate the dependence on the wind speed, the Stokes number, the permeability of the membrane on the slit and the saltation height. 
0808.02650	T-duality for open strings in the presence of backgrounds and noncommutativity	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:C. A. Ballon Bayona, Nelson R. F. Braga, Rafael D'Andrea	Abstract:  We investigate the effect of T-duality on noncommutativity. Starting with open strings ending on a D2-brane wrapped on a $T^2$ torus in the presence of a Kalb Ramond field, we consider Buscher transformations on the coordinates and background. We find that the dual system is commutative. We also study alternative transformations that can preserve noncommutativity. 
0808.02651	The Chemical and Ionization Conditions in Weak Mg II Absorbers	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Anand Narayanan, Jane C. Charlton, Toru Misawa, Rebecca E. Green, Tae-Sun Kim	Abstract:  We present an analysis of the chemical and ionization conditions in a sample of 100 weak Mg II absorbers identified in the VLT/UVES archive of quasar spectra. Using a host of low ionization lines associated with each absorber in this sample, and on the basis of ionization models, we infer that the metallicity in a significant fraction of weak Mg II clouds is constrained to values of solar or higher, if they are sub-Lyman limit systems. Based on the observed constraints, we present a physical picture in which weak Mg II absorbers are predominantly tracing two different astrophysical processes/structures. A significant population of weak Mg II clouds, those in which N(Fe II) is much less than N(Mg II), identified at both low (z ~ 1) and high (z ~ 2) redshift, are potentially tracing gas in the extended halos of galaxies, analogous to the Galactic high velocity clouds. These absorbers might correspond to alpha-enhanced interstellar gas expelled from star-forming galaxies, in correlated supernova events. On the other hand, N(FeII) approximately equal to N(Mg II) clouds, which are prevalent only at lower redshifts (z < 1.5), must be tracing Type Ia enriched gas in small, high metallicity pockets in dwarf galaxies, tidal debris, or other intergalactic structures. 
0808.02652	Squeezing Out the Entropy of Fermions in Optical Lattices	Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas)	Authors:Tin-Lun Ho, Qi Zhou	Abstract:  At present, there is considerable interest in using atomic fermions in optical lattices to emulate the mathematical models that have been used to study strongly correlated electronic systems. Some of these models, such as the two dimensional fermion Hubbard model, are notoriously difficult to solve, and their key properties remain controversial despite decades of studies. It is hoped that the emulation experiments will shed light on some of these long standing problems. A successful emulation, however, requires reaching temperatures as low as $10^{-12}$K and beyond, with entropy per particle far lower than what can be achieved today. Achieving such low entropy states is an essential step and a grand challenge of the whole emulation enterprise. In this paper, we point out a method to literally squeeze the entropy out from a Fermi gas into a surrounding Bose-Einstein condensed gas (BEC), which acts as a heat reservoir. This method allows one to reduce the entropy per particle of a lattice Fermi gas to a few percent of the lowest value obtainable today. 
0808.02653	Possible Superconductivity in Fe-Sb Based Materials: Density Functional Study of LiFeSb	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Lijun Zhang, Alaska Subedi, D.J. Singh, Mao-Hua Du	Abstract:  We investigate the electronic and other properties of the hypothetical compound LiFeSb in relation to superconducting LiFeAs and FeSe using density functional calculations. The results show that LiFeSb in the LiFeAs structure would be dynamically stable in the sense of having no unstable phonon modes, and would have very similar electronic and magnetic properties to the layered Fe based superconductors. Importantly, a very similar structure for the Fermi surface and a spin density wave related to but stronger than that in the corresponding As compound is found. These results are indicative of possible superconductivity analogous to the Fe-As based compounds if the spin density wave can be suppressed by doping or other means. Prospects for synthesizing this material in pure form or in solid solution with FeTe are discussed. 
0808.02654	Report on the "Secure Vehicular Communications: Results and Challenges Ahead" Workshop	Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)	Authors:Panos Papadimitratos, Jean-Pierre Hubaux	Abstract:  This is a report and a collection of abstracts from the Feb. 2008 Lausanne Workshop on Secure Vehicular Communication Systems. 
0808.02655	Cosmology-Independent Distance Moduli of 42 Gamma-Ray Bursts between Redshift of 1.44 and 6.60	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Nan Liang, Shuang Nan Zhang	Abstract:  This report is an update and extension of our paper accepted for publication in ApJ (arXiv:0802.4262). Since objects at the same redshift should have the same luminosity distance and the distance moduli of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained directly from observations are completely cosmology independent, we obtain the distance modulus of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) at a given redshift by interpolating or iterating from the Hubble diagram of SNe Ia. Then we calibrate five GRB relations without assuming a particular cosmological model, from different regression methods, and construct the GRB Hubble diagram to constrain cosmological parameters. Based upon these relations we list the cosmology-independent distance moduli of 42 GRBs between redshift of 1.44 and 6.60, with the 1-$σ$ uncertainties of 1-3%. 
0808.02656	A multi-channel Poissonian model for multi-parton scatterings	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Daniele Treleani (University of Trieste, INFN and ICTP)    	Abstract:  Multiple parton interactions are typically implemented in Montecarlo codes by assuming a Poissonian distribution of collisions with average number depending on the impact parameter. A possible generalization, which links the process to hadronic diffraction, is shortly discussed. 
0808.02657	Some remarks on the Stanley's depth for multigraded modules	Commutative Algebra (math.AC)	Authors:Mircea Cimpoeas	Abstract:  We show that the Stanley's conjecture holds for any multigraded $S$-module $M$ with $\sdepth(M)=0$, where $S=K[x_1,...,x_n]$. Also, we give some bounds for the Stanley depth of the powers of the maximal irrelevant ideal in $S$. 
0808.02658	Invariant conformal metrics on S^n	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Jose M. Espinar	Abstract:  In this paper we use the relationship between conformal metrics on the sphere and horospherically convex hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space for giving sufficient conditions on a conformal metric to be radial under some constrain on the eigenvalues of its Schouten tensor. Also, we study conformal metrics on the sphere which are invariant by a $k-$parameter subgroup of conformal diffeomorphisms of the sphere, giving a bound on its maximum dimension. Moreover, we classify conformal metrics on the sphere whose eigenvalues of the Shouten tensor are all constant (we call them \emph{isoparametric conformal metrics}), and we use a classification result for radial conformal metrics which are solution of some $σ_k -$Yamabe type problem for obtaining existence of rotational spheres and Delaunay-type hypersurfaces for some classes of Weingarten hypersurfaces in $\h ^{n+1}$. 
0808.02659	Distributed Source Coding using Abelian Group Codes	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Dinesh Krithivasan, S. Sandeep Pradhan	Abstract:  In this work, we consider a distributed source coding problem with a joint distortion criterion depending on the sources and the reconstruction. This includes as a special case the problem of computing a function of the sources to within some distortion and also the classic Slepian-Wolf problem, Berger-Tung problem, Wyner-Ziv problem, Yeung-Berger problem and the Ahlswede-Korner-Wyner problem. While the prevalent trend in information theory has been to prove achievability results using Shannon's random coding arguments, using structured random codes offer rate gains over unstructured random codes for many problems. Motivated by this, we present a new achievable rate-distortion region for this problem for discrete memoryless sources based on "good" structured random nested codes built over abelian groups. We demonstrate rate gains for this problem over traditional coding schemes using random unstructured codes. For certain sources and distortion functions, the new rate region is strictly bigger than the Berger-Tung rate region, which has been the best known achievable rate region for this problem till now. Further, there is no known unstructured random coding scheme that achieves these rate gains. Achievable performance limits for single-user source coding using abelian group codes are also obtained as parts of the proof of the main coding theorem. As a corollary, we also prove that nested linear codes achieve the Shannon rate-distortion bound in the single-user setting. 
0808.02660	A basic limitation on inferring phylogenies by pairwise sequence comparisons	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:Mike Steel	Abstract:  Distance-based approaches in phylogenetics such as Neighbor-Joining are a fast and popular approach for building trees. These methods take pairs of sequences from them construct a value that, in expectation, is additive under a stochastic model of site substitution. Most models assume a distribution of rates across sites, often based on a gamma distribution. Provided the (shape) parameter of this distribution is known, the method can correctly reconstruct the tree. However, if the shape parameter is not known then we show that topologically different trees, with different shape parameters and associated positive branch lengths, can lead to exactly matching distributions on pairwise site patterns between all pairs of taxa. Thus, one could not distinguish between the two trees using pairs of sequences without some prior knowledge of the shape parameter. More surprisingly, this can happen for {\em any} choice of distinct shape parameters on the two trees, and thus the result is not peculiar to a particular or contrived selection of the shape parameters. On a positive note, we point out known conditions where identifiability can be restored (namely, when the branch lengths are clocklike, or if methods such as maximum likelihood are used). 
0808.02661	Combined Chandra, XMM-Newton and Hubble Space Telescope observations of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 2808	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Servillat, A. Dieball, N. A. Webb, C. Knigge, R. Cornelisse, D. Barret, K. S. Long, M. M. Shara, D. R. Zurek	Abstract:  Using new Chandra X-ray observations and existing XMM-Newton X-ray and Hubble far ultraviolet observations, we aim to detect and identify the faint X-ray sources belonging to the Galactic globular cluster NGC 2808 in order to understand their role in the evolution of globular clusters. We present a Chandra X-ray observation of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 2808. We classify the X-ray sources associated with the cluster by analysing their colours and variability. Previous observations with XMM-Newton and far ultraviolet observations with the Hubble Space Telescope are re-investigated to help identify the Chandra sources associated with the cluster. We compare our results to population synthesis models and observations of other Galactic globular clusters. We detect 113 sources, of which 16 fall inside the half-mass radius of NGC 2808 and are concentrated towards the cluster core. From statistical analysis, these 16 sources are very likely to be linked to the cluster. We detect short-term (1 day) variability in X-rays for 7 sources, of which 2 fall inside the half-mass radius, and long-term (28 months) variability for 10 further sources, of which 2 fall inside the half-mass radius. Ultraviolet counterparts are found for 8 Chandra sources in the core, of which 2 have good matching probabilities and have ultraviolet properties expected for cataclysmic variables. We find one likely neutron star-quiescent low-mass X-ray binary and 7 cataclysmic variable candidates in the core of NGC 2808. The other 8 sources are cataclysmic variable candidates, but some could possibly be active binaries or millisecond pulsars. We find a possible deficit of X-ray sources compared to 47 Tuc which could be related to the metallicity content and the complexity of the evolution of NGC 2808. 
0808.02662	Multitask Efficiencies in the Decision Tree Model	Computational Complexity (cs.CC)	Authors:Andrew Drucker	Abstract:  In Direct Sum problems [KRW], one tries to show that for a given computational model, the complexity of computing a collection of finite functions on independent inputs is approximately the sum of their individual complexities. In this paper, by contrast, we study the diversity of ways in which the joint computational complexity can behave when all the functions are evaluated on a common input. We focus on the deterministic decision tree model, with depth as the complexity measure; in this model we prove a result to the effect that the 'obvious' constraints on joint computational complexity are essentially the only ones. The proof uses an intriguing new type of cryptographic data structure called a `mystery bin' which we construct using a small polynomial separation between deterministic and unambiguous query complexity shown by Savicky. We also pose a variant of the Direct Sum Conjecture of [KRW] which, if proved for a single family of functions, could yield an analogous result for models such as the communication model. 
0808.02663	Electromagnetic Dipole Strength in Transitional Nuclei	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:S.Q.Zhang, I.Bentley, S.Brant, F.Dönau, S.Frauendorf, B.Kämpfer, R.Schwengner, A.Wagner	Abstract:  Electromagnetic dipole absorption cross-sections of transitional nuclei with large-amplitude shape fluctuations are calculated in a microscopic way by introducing the concept of Instantaneous Shape Sampling. The concept bases on the slow shape dynamics as compared to the fast dipole vibrations. The elctromagnetic dipole strength is calculated by means of RPA for the instantaneous shapes, the probability of which is obtained by means of IBA. Very good agreement with the experimental absorption cross sections near the nucleon emission threshold is obtained. 
0808.02664	Communication-optimal parallel and sequential QR and LU factorizations	Numerical Analysis (math.NA)	Authors:James Demmel, Laura Grigori, Mark Hoemmen, Julien Langou	Abstract:  We present parallel and sequential dense QR factorization algorithms that are both optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors) in the amount of communication they perform, and just as stable as Householder QR. We prove optimality by extending known lower bounds on communication bandwidth for sequential and parallel matrix multiplication to provide latency lower bounds, and show these bounds apply to the LU and QR decompositions. We not only show that our QR algorithms attain these lower bounds (up to polylogarithmic factors), but that existing LAPACK and ScaLAPACK algorithms perform asymptotically more communication. We also point out recent LU algorithms in the literature that attain at least some of these lower bounds. 
0808.02665	Rapidity divergences and valid definitions of parton densities	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:John Collins	Abstract:  Rapidity divergences occur when parton densities in a gauge theory are defined in the most natural way, as expectation values of partonic number operators in light-front quantization. I review these and other related divergences, and show how the definitions of parton densities can be modified to remove the divergences. A modified definition is not only essential for many phenomenological applications of QCD, but also concerns the treatment of parton densities in non-perturbative approaches. The necessity of modifications in the definition of a parton density also entails corrections in the formulation of light-front quantization for gauge theories. 
0808.02666	Impact of Vehicular Communications Security on Transportation Safety	Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)	Authors:Panos Papadimitratos, Giorgio Calandriello, Jean-Pierre Hubaux, Antonio Lioy	Abstract:  Transportation safety, one of the main driving forces of the development of vehicular communication (VC) systems, relies on high-rate safety messaging (beaconing). At the same time, there is consensus among authorities, industry, and academia on the need to secure VC systems. With specific proposals in the literature, a critical question must be answered: can secure VC systems be practical and satisfy the requirements of safety applications, in spite of the significant communication and processing overhead and other restrictions security and privacy-enhancing mechanisms impose? To answer this question, we investigate in this paper the following three dimensions for secure and privacy-enhancing VC schemes: the reliability of communication, the processing overhead at each node, and the impact on a safety application. The results indicate that with the appropriate system design, including sufficiently high processing power, applications enabled by secure VC can be in practice as effective as those enabled by unsecured VC. 
0808.02667	The Acceleration of the Nebular Shells in Planetary Nebulae in the Milky Way Bulge	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Michael G. Richer, Jose Alberto Lopez, Margarita Pereyra, Hortensia Riesgo, Maria Teresa Garcia Diaz, Sol-Haret Baez	Abstract:  We present a systematic study of line widths in the [\ion{O}{3}]$λ$5007 and H$α$ lines for a sample of 86 planetary nebulae in the Milky Way bulge based upon spectroscopy obtained at the \facility{Observatorio Astronómico Nacional in the Sierra San Pedro Mártir (OAN-SPM)} using the Manchester Echelle Spectrograph. The planetary nebulae were selected with the intention of simulating samples of bright extragalactic planetary nebulae. We separate the planetary nebulae into two samples containing cooler and hotter central stars, defined by the absence or presence, respectively, of the \ion{He}{2} $λ$6560 line in the H$α$ spectra. This division separates samples of younger and more evolved planetary nebulae. The sample of planetary nebulae with hotter central stars has systematically larger line widths, larger radii, lower electron densities, and lower H$β$ luminosities. The distributions of these parameters in the two samples all differ at significance levels exceeding 99%. These differences are all in agreement with the expectations from hydrodynamical models, but for the first time confirmed for a homogeneous and statistically significant sample of galactic planetary nebulae. We interpret these differences as evidence for the acceleration of the nebular shells during the early evolution of these intrinsically bright planetary nebulae. As is the case for planetary nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds, the acceleration of the nebular shells appears to be the direct result of the evolution of the central stars. 
0808.02668	Secure Neighbor Discovery in Wireless Networks: Formal Investigation of Possibility	Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)	Authors:Marcin Poturalski, Panos Papadimitratos, Jean-Pierre Hubaux	Abstract:  Wireless communication enables a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from commodity to tactical systems. Neighbor discovery (ND), that is, determining which devices are within direct radio communication, is a building block of network protocols and applications, and its vulnerability can severely compromise their functionalities. A number of proposals to secure ND have been published, but none have analyzed the problem formally. In this paper, we contribute such an analysis: We build a formal model capturing salient characteristics of wireless systems, most notably obstacles and interference, and we provide a specification of a basic variant of the ND problem. Then, we derive an impossibility result for a general class of protocols we term "time-based protocols," to which many of the schemes in the literature belong. We also identify the conditions under which the impossibility result is lifted. Moreover, we explore a second class of protocols we term "time- and location-based protocols," and prove they can secure ND. 
0808.02669	Closed Timelike Curves Make Quantum and Classical Computing Equivalent	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Scott Aaronson, John Watrous	Abstract:  While closed timelike curves (CTCs) are not known to exist, studying their consequences has led to nontrivial insights in general relativity, quantum information, and other areas. In this paper we show that if CTCs existed, then quantum computers would be no more powerful than classical computers: both would have the (extremely large) power of the complexity class PSPACE, consisting of all problems solvable by a conventional computer using a polynomial amount of memory. This solves an open problem proposed by one of us in 2005, and gives an essentially complete understanding of computational complexity in the presence of CTCs. Following the work of Deutsch, we treat a CTC as simply a region of spacetime where a "causal consistency" condition is imposed, meaning that Nature has to produce a (probabilistic or quantum) fixed-point of some evolution operator. Our conclusion is then a consequence of the following theorem: given any quantum circuit (not necessarily unitary), a fixed-point of the circuit can be (implicitly) computed in polynomial space. This theorem might have independent applications in quantum information. 
0808.02670	Solving the apparent diversity-accuracy dilemma of recommender systems	Information Retrieval (cs.IR)	Authors:Tao Zhou, Zoltan Kuscsik, Jian-Guo Liu, Matus Medo, Joseph R. Wakeling, Yi-Cheng Zhang	Abstract:  Recommender systems use data on past user preferences to predict possible future likes and interests. A key challenge is that while the most useful individual recommendations are to be found among diverse niche objects, the most reliably accurate results are obtained by methods that recommend objects based on user or object similarity. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm specifically to address the challenge of diversity and show how it can be used to resolve this apparent dilemma when combined in an elegant hybrid with an accuracy-focused algorithm. By tuning the hybrid appropriately we are able to obtain, without relying on any semantic or context-specific information, simultaneous gains in both accuracy and diversity of recommendations. 
0808.02671	Are There Meteors Originated from Near Earth Asteroid (25143) Itokawa?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:K. Ohtsuka, S. Abe, M. Abe, H. Yano, J. Watanabe	Abstract:  As a result of a survey of Itokawid meteors (i.e., meteors originated from Near Earth Asteroid (25143) Itokawa = 1998SF36), from among the multi-station optical meteor orbit data of ~15000 orbits, and applying the D-criteria, we could find five Itokawid meteor candidates. We also analyzed corresponding mineral materials of the Itokawid candidates through their trajectory and atmospheric data. We conclude, on the basis of our investigation, that the fireball, MORP172, is the strongest Itokawid candidate. 
0808.02672	Conformal dimension: Cantor sets and moduli	Complex Variables (math.CV)	Authors:Hrant Hakobyan	Abstract:  In this paper we give several conditions for a space to be minimal for conformal dimension. We show that there are sets of zero length and conformal dimension 1 thus answering a question of Bishop and Tyson. Another sufficient condition for minimality is given in terms of a modulus of a system of measures in the sense of Fuglede \cite{Fug}. It implies in particular that there are many sets $E\subset\mathbb{R}$ of zero length such that $X\times Y$ is minimal for conformal dimension for every compact $Y$. 
0808.02673	Preferred-Frame and CP-Violation Tests with Polarized Electrons	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:B.R. Heckel, E.G. Adelberger, C.E. Cramer, T.S. Cook, S. Schlamminger, U. Schmidt	Abstract:  We used a torsion pendulum containing $\approx 10^{23}$ polarized electrons to search new interactions that couple to electron spin. We limit CP-violating interactions between the pendulum's electrons and unpolarized matter in the earth or the sun, test for rotation and boost-dependent preferred-frame effects using the earth's rotation and velocity with respect to the entire cosmos, and search for exotic velocity-dependent potentials between polarized electrons and unpolarized matter in the sun and moon. Finally, we find that the gravitational mass of an electron spinning toward the galactic center differs by less than about 1 part in $10^{21}$ from an electron spinning in the opposite direction. As a byproduct of this work, the density of polarized electrons in Sm$ $Co$_5$ was measured to be $(4.19\pm 0.19)\times 10^{22} {\rm cm}^{-3}$ at a field of 9.6 kG. 
0808.02674	Fast and simple characterization of a photon pair source	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Felix Bussieres, Joshua A. Slater, Nicolas Godbout, Wolfgang Tittel	Abstract:  We present an exact model of the detection statistics of a probabilistic source of photon pairs from which a fast, simple and precise method to measure the source's brightness and photon channel transmissions is demonstrated. We measure such properties for a source based on spontaneous parametric downconversion in a periodically poled LiNbO$_3$ crystal producing pairs at 810 and 1550 nm wavelengths. We further validate the model by comparing the predicted and measured values for the $g^{(2)}(0)$ of a heralded single photon source over a wide range of the brightness. Our model is of particular use for monitoring and tuning the brightness on demand as required for various quantum communication applications. We comment on its applicability to sources involving spectral and/or spatial filtering. 
0808.02675	Low-temperature magnetic ordering in SrEr$_2$O$_4$	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:O.A. Petrenko, G. Balakrishnan, N.R. Wilson, S. de Brion, E. Suard, L.C. Chapon	Abstract:  SrEr$_2$O$_4$ has been characterised by low-temperature powder neutron diffraction, as well as single crystal specific heat and magnetisation measurements. Magnetisation measurements show that the magnetic system is highly anisotropic at temperature above ordering. A magnetic field of 280 kOe applied at $T=1.6$ K does not overcome the anisotropic magnetisation and fails to fully saturate the system. Long range antiferromagnetic ordering develops below $T_N=0.75$ K, identified by magnetic Bragg reflections with propagation vector ${\bf k}=0$ and a lambda anomaly in the specific heat. The magnetic structure consists of ferromagnetic chains running along the \textit{c} axis, two adjacent chains being stacked antiferromagnetically. The moments point along the \textit{c} direction, but only one of the two crystallographically in-equivalent Er sites has a sizeable ordered magnetic moment, 4.5 $\rm μ_B$ at 0.55 K. The magnetic properties of SrEr$_2$O$_4$ are discussed in terms of the interplay between the low-dimensionality, competing exchange interactions, dipolar interactions and low lying crystal field levels. 
0808.02676	Efficient and Robust Secure Aggregation for Sensor Networks	Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)	Authors:P. Haghani, P. Papadimitratos, M. Poturalski, K. Aberer, J.-P. Hubaux	Abstract:  Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) rely on in-network aggregation for efficiency, however, this comes at a price: A single adversary can severely influence the outcome by contributing an arbitrary partial aggregate value. Secure in-network aggregation can detect such manipulation. But as long as such faults persist, no aggregation result can be obtained. In contrast, the collection of individual sensor node values is robust and solves the problem of availability, yet in an inefficient way. Our work seeks to bridge this gap in secure data collection: We propose a system that enhances availability with an efficiency close to that of in-network aggregation. To achieve this, our scheme relies on costly operations to localize and exclude nodes that manipulate the aggregation, but \emph{only} when a failure is detected. The detection of aggregation disruptions and the removal of faulty nodes provides robustness. At the same time, after removing faulty nodes, the WSN can enjoy low cost (secure) aggregation. Thus, the high exclusion cost is amortized, and efficiency increases. 
0808.02677	The Intrinsic Difficulties of Constructing Strongly Correlated States of Lattice Quantum Gases by Connecting Up Pre-engineered Isolated Atomic Clusters	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Tin-Lun Ho	Abstract:  Suppose one engineers an artificial antiferromagnet on an array of {\em isolated} wells, and then increases the tunneling between wells slowly, will the system finally become an {\em equilibrium} antiferromagnet? Here, we show that due to the intrinsic non-adiabaticity at the start of this process, and that the atoms in the initial state in different wells are completely uncorrelated, the final equilibrium state will have a temperature $T_{f}$ far above the Neel temperature. Constructing other strongly correlated states (with characteristic energy per particle $E^{\ast}$ comparable to the hopping or the virtual hopping scale) with the same method will suffer the same problem, i.e. $T_{f}>>E^{\ast}$. 
0808.02678	Y-junction of superconducting Josephson chains	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Domenico Giuliano, Pasquale Sodano	Abstract:  We show that, for pertinent values of the fabrication and control parameters, an attractive finite coupling fixed point emerges in the phase diagram of a Y-junction of superconducting Josephson chains. The new fixed point arises only when the dimensionless flux $f$ piercing the central loop of the network equals $π$ and, thus, does not break time-reversal invariance; for $f \neq π$, only the strongly coupled fixed point survives as a stable attractive fixed point. Phase slips (instantons) have a crucial role in establishing this transition: we show indeed that, at $f = π$, a new set of instantons -the W-instantons- comes into play to destabilize the strongly coupled fixed point. Finally, we provide a detailed account of the Josephson current-phase relationship along the arms of the network, near each one of the allowed fixed points. Our results evidence remarkable similarities between the phase diagram accessible to a Y-junction of superconducting Josephson chains and the one found in the analysis of quantum Brownian motion on frustrated planar lattices. 
0808.02679	Integer Points in Backward Orbits	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Vijay A. Sookdeo	Abstract:  A theorem of J. Silverman states that a forward orbit of a rational map $φ(z)$ on $\mathbb P^1(K)$ contains finitely many $S$-integers in the number field $K$ when $(φ\circφ)(z)$ is not a polynomial. We state an analogous conjecture for the backward orbits using a general $S$-integrality notion based on the Galois conjugates of points. This conjecture is proven for the map $φ(z)=z^d$, and consequently Chebyshev polynomials, by uniformly bounding the number of Galois orbits for $z^n-β$ when $β\not =0$ is a non-root of unity. In general, our conjecture is true provided that the number of Galois orbits for $φ^n(z)-β$ is bounded independently of $n$. 
0808.02680	Optimal control of a leaking qubit	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Patrick Rebentrost, Frank K. Wilhelm	Abstract:  Physical implementations of quantum bits can contain coherent transitions to energetically close non-qubit states. In particular, for anharmonic oscillator systems such as the superconducting phase qubit and the transmon a two-level approximation is insufficient. We apply optimal control theory to the envelope of a resonant Rabi pulse in a qubit in the presence of a single, weakly off-resonant leakage level. The gate error of a spin flip operation reduces by orders of magnitude compared to simple pulse shapes. Near-perfect gates can be achieved for any pulse duration longer than an intrinsic limit given by the nonlinearity. The pulses can be understood as composite sequences that refocus the leakage transition. We also discuss ways to improve the pulse shapes. 
0808.02681	Quantum properties of a superposition of squeezed displaced two-mode vacuum and single-photon states	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Faisal A. A. El-Orany, A-S. F. Obada, Zafer M. Asker, J. Perina	Abstract:  In this paper, we study some quantum properties of a superposition of displaced squeezed two-mode vacuum and single-photon states, such as the second-order correlation function, the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, quadrature squeezing, quasiprobability distribution functions and purity. This type of states includes two mechanisms, namely, interference in phase space and entanglement. We show that these states can exhibit sub-Piossonian statistics, squeezing and deviate from the classical Cauchy-Schwartz inequality. Moreover, the amount of entanglement in the system can be increased by increasing the squeezing mechanism. In the framework of the quasiprobability distribution functions we show that the single-mode state can tend to thermal state based on the correlation mechanism. Generation scheme for such states is given. 
0808.02682	From force distribution to average coordination number in frictional granular matter	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Ping Wang, Chaoming Song, Christopher Briscoe, Kun Wang, Hernan A. Makse	Abstract:  We study the joint probability distribution of normal and tangential frictional forces in jammed granular media, $P_μ(f_t, f_n)$, for various friction coefficient $μ$, especially when $μ= \infty$. A universal scaling law is found to collapse the data for $μ=0$ to $\infty$ demonstrating a link between force distribution $P_μ(f_t, f_n)$ and average coordination number, $z^μ_c$. The results determine $z_c^μ$ for a finite friction coefficient, extending the constraints counting argument of isostatic granular packing to finite frictional packings. 
0808.02683	Study a0(980)-f0(980) mixing from a0(980) -> f0(980) transition	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Jia-Jun Wu, B. S. Zou	Abstract:  Various processes have been proposed previously to study a0(980)-f0(980) mixing through f0(980)->a0(980) transition. Here we investigate in detail the difference between a0(980)->f0(980) and f0(980)->a0(980) transitions. It is found that the a0(980)->f0(980) transition can provide additional constrains to the parameters of a0(980) and f0(980) mesons. Proposal is made to study a0(980)-f0(980) mixing from chi_{c1}->pi^0 a0(980) -> pi^0 f0(980) reaction at the upgraded Beijing electron positron collider with the BESIII detector. 
0808.02684	Hydrodynamics and Flow	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Tetsufumi Hirano, Naomi van der Kolk, Ante Bilandzic	Abstract:  In this lecture note, we present several topics on relativistic hydrodynamics and its application to relativistic heavy ion collisions. In the first part we give a brief introduction to relativistic hydrodynamics in the context of heavy ion collisions. In the second part we present the formalism and some fundamental aspects of relativistic ideal and viscous hydrodynamics. In the third part, we start with some basic checks of the fundamental observables followed by discussion of collective flow, in particular elliptic flow, which is one of the most exciting phenomenon in heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies. Next we discuss how to formulate the hydrodynamic model to describe dynamics of heavy ion collisions. Finally, we conclude the third part of the lecture note by showing some results from ideal hydrodynamic calculations and by comparing them with the experimental data. 
0808.02685	Statistical Tools for Analyzing the Cosmic Ray Energy Spectrum	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. D. Hague, B. R. Becker, M. S. Gold, J. A. J. Matthews	Abstract:  In this paper un-binned statistical tools for analyzing the cosmic ray energy spectrum are developed and illustrated with a simulated data set. The methods are designed to extract accurate and precise model parameter estimators in the presence of statistical and systematic energy errors. Two robust methods are used to test for the presence of flux suppression at the highest energies: the Tail-Power statistic and a likelihood ratio test. Both tests give evidence of flux suppression in the simulated data. The tools presented can be generalized for use on any astrophysical data set where the power-law assumption is relevant and can be used to aid observational design. 
0808.02686	Discretely ordered groups	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Peter A. Linnell, Akbar H. Rhemtulla, Dale P. O. Rolfsen	Abstract:  We consider group orders and right-orders which are discrete, meaning there is a least element which is greater than the identity. We note that free groups cannot be given discrete orders, although they do have right-orders which are discrete. More generally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions that a given orderable group can be endowed with a discrete order. In particular, every orderable group G embeds in a discretely orderable group. We also consider conditions on right-orderable groups to be discretely right-orderable. Finally, we discuss a number of illustrative examples involving discrete orderability, including the Artin braid groups and Bergman's non-locally-indicable right orderable groups. 
0808.02687	Quantum Memory with Optically Trapped Atoms	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Chih-Sung Chuu, Thorsten Strassel, Bo Zhao, Markus Koch, Yu-Ao Chen, Shuai Chen, Zhen-Sheng Yuan, Joerg Schmiedmayer, Jian-Wei Pan	Abstract:  We report the experimental demonstration of a quantum memory for collective atomic states in a far-detuned optical dipole trap. Generation of the collective atomic state is heralded by the detection of a Raman scattered photon and accompanied by storage in the ensemble of atoms. The optical dipole trap provides confinement for the atoms during the quantum storage while retaining the atomic coherence. We probe the quantum storage by cross-correlation of the photon pair arising from the Raman scattering and the retrieval of the atomic state stored in the memory. Non-classical correlations are observed for storage times up to 60 microseconds. 
0808.02688	A simple estimation of the maximal rank of tensors with two slices by row and column operations, symmetrization and induction	Rings and Algebras (math.RA)	Authors:Toshio Sakata, Toshio Sumi, Mitsuhiro Miyazaki	Abstract:  The determination of the maximal ranks of a set of a given type of tensors is a basic problem both in theory and application. In statistical applications, the maximal rank is related to the number of necessary parameters to be built in a tensor model. Based on this classical theorem by Bosch we will show the tight bound for 2 x n x n tensors by simple row and column operations, symmetrization and mathematical induction, which has been given by several authors based on eigenvalue theories. 
0808.02689	On the dangers of using the growth equation on large scales in the Newtonian gauge	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:James B. Dent, Sourish Dutta	Abstract:  We examine the accuracy of the growth equation $\ddotδ + 2H\dotδ - 4πGρδ= 0$, which is ubiquitous in the cosmological literature, in the context of the Newtonian gauge. By comparing the growth predicted by this equation to a numerical solution of the linearized Einstein equations in the $Λ$CDM scenario, we show that while this equation is a reliable approximation on small scales ($k\gtrsim $h Mpc$^{-1}$), it can be disastrously inaccurate ($\sim 10^4% $) on larger scales in this gauge. We propose a modified version of the growth equation for the Newtonian gauge, which while preserving the simplicity of the original equation, provides considerably more accurate results. We examine the implications of the failure of the growth equation on a few recent studies, aimed at discriminating general relativity from modified gravity, which use this equation as a starting point. We show that while the results of these studies are valid on small scales, they are not reliable on large scales or high redshifts, if one works in the Newtonian gauge. Finally, we discuss the growth equation in the synchronous gauge and show that the corrections to the Poisson equation are exactly equivalent to the difference between the overdensities in the synchronous and Newtonian gauges. 
0808.02690	Complex manifolds with generating tangent bundles	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Renyi Ma	Abstract:  Let $M$ be a close complex manifold and $TM$ its holomorphic tangent bundle. We prove that if the global holomorphic sections of tangent bundle generate each fibre, then $M$ is a complex homogeneous manifold. Our proof depends on the complex version of Chow-Rashevskii theorem in Carnot-Caratheodory spaces. 
0808.02691	Fuzzy Ring from M2-brane Giant Torus	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Tatsuma Nishioka, Tadashi Takayanagi	Abstract:  We construct spinning dual M2 giant gravitons in AdS_4 x S^7, which generically become 1/16 BPS states, and show that their world-volumes become torii. By taking an orbifold, we obtain spinning dielectric D2-brane configurations in AdS_4 x CP^3 dual to specific BPS operators in ABJM theory. This reveals a novel mechanism how to give an angular momentum to a dielectric D2-brane. We also find that when its angular momentum in the AdS_4 becomes large, it approaches to a ring-like object. Our result might suggest an existence of supersymmetric black rings in the AdS_4 background. We will also discuss dual giant gravitons in AdS_4 x CP^3. 
0808.02692	A dozen integrals: Russell-style	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Tewodros Amdeberhan, Victor Moll	Abstract:  On June 15, 1876, the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London published a paper by Mr. W. H. L. Russell entitled "On certain integrals". The paper starts with "The following are certain integrals which will, I hope, be found interesting". The rest of the paper is simply a list of 12 integrals. We provide a list of 12 integrals that we hope would be interesting. 
0808.02693	AKARI/FIS Mapping of the ISM-Wind Bow Shock around Alpha Ori	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Toshiya Ueta (U. Denver), Hideyuki Izumiura (OAO/NAOJ), Issei Yamamura (ISAS/JAXA), Yoshikazu Nakada (U. Tokyo/Kiso Obs.), Mikako Matsuura (NAOJ/UCL), Yoshifusa Ita (NAOJ/ISAS), Toshihiko Tanabe (U. Tokyo), Hinako Fukushi (U. Tokyo), Noriyuki Matsunaga (Kyoto U.), Hiroyuki Mito (Kiso Obs.)    	Abstract:  We present 10' x 50' scan maps around an M supergiant Alpha Ori at 65, 90, 140 and 160 microns obtained with the AKARI Infrared Astronomy Satellite. Higher spatial resolution data with the exact analytic solution permit us to fit the de-projected shape of the stellar wind bow shock around Alpha Ori to have the stand-off distance of 4.8', position angle of 55 degrees and inclination angle of 56 degrees. The shape of the bow shock suggests that the peculiar velocity of Alpha Ori with respect to the local medium is v_* = 40 (n_H)^(-1/2), where n_H is the hydrogen nucleus density at Alpha Ori. We find that the local medium is of n_H = 1.5 to 1.9 cm^(-3) and the velocity of the local flow is at 11 km s^(-1) by using the most recent astrometric solutions for Alpha Ori under the assumption that the local medium is moving away from the Orion OB 1 association. AKARI images may also reveal a vortex ring due to instabilities on the surface of the bow shock as demonstrated by numerical models. This research exemplifies the potential of AKARI All-Sky data as well as follow-up observations with Herschel Space Telescope and Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy for this avenue of research in revealing the nature of interaction between the stellar wind and interstellar medium. 
0808.02694	Mutual information and swap operation in the two-qubit Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya anisotropic antisymmetric interaction	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Guo-Feng Zhang	Abstract:  Mutual information and swap operation in the two-qubit Heisenberg model with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) anisotropic antisymmetric interaction are investigated. It is found that the mutual information I of such a quantum channel is sensitive to the initial conditions and declines with the increase of the temperature. The DM interaction can lead to a higher mutual information, especially for the ferromagnetic case. The entanglement quality of input states cannot enhance the mutual information of the quantum channel. When the DM interaction is large, the mutual information will be the maximum value 2 for a non-entangled input state, but it is 1 for a maximally entangled input one. It is also shown that the swap operation can be implemented for some kinds of DM coupling. The conditions of the DM coupling under which the swap operation is feasible are established. 
0808.02695	Resistivity saturation in PrFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_y$ superconductor: An evidence of strong electron-phonon coupling	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:D. Bhoi, P. Mandal, P. Choudhury	Abstract:  We have measured the resistivity of PrFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_y$ samples over a wide range of temperature in order to elucidate the role of electron-phonon interaction on normal- and superconducting-state properties. The linear T dependence of $ρ$ above 170 K followed by a saturationlike behavior at higher temperature is a clear signature of strong electron-phonon coupling. From the analysis of T dependence of $ρ$, we have estimated several normal-state parameters useful for understanding the origin of superconductivity in this system. Our results suggest that Fe-based oxypnictides are phonon mediated BCS superconductors like Chevrel phases and A15 compounds. 
0808.02696	Time-delay interferometry and the relativistic treatment of LISA optical links	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:S. V. Dhurandhar	Abstract:  LISA is a joint space mission of the ESA and NASA for detecting low frequency gravitational radiation in the band $10^{-5} - 1$ Hz. In order to attain the requisite sensitivity for LISA, the laser frequency noise must be suppressed below the other secondary noises such as the optical path noise, acceleration noise etc. This is achieved because of the redundancy in the data, more specifically, by combining six appropriately time-delayed data streams containing fractional Doppler shifts - time delay interferometry (TDI). The orbits of the spacecraft are computed in the gravitational field of the Sun and Earth in the Newtonian framework, while the optical links are treated fully general relativistically and thus, effects such as the Sagnac, Shapiro delay, etc. are automatically incorporated. We show that in the model of LISA that we consider here, there are symmetries inherent in the physics, which may be used effectively to suppress the residual laser frequency noise and simplify the algebraic approach to TDI. 
0808.02697	Adiabatic approximation with exponential accuracy for many-body systems and quantum computation	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:D.A. Lidar, A.T. Rezakhani, A. Hamma	Abstract:  We derive a version of the adiabatic theorem that is especially suited for applications in adiabatic quantum computation, where it is reasonable to assume that the adiabatic interpolation between the initial and final Hamiltonians is controllable. Assuming that the Hamiltonian is analytic in a finite strip around the real time axis, that some number of its time-derivatives vanish at the initial and final times, and that the target adiabatic eigenstate is non-degenerate and separated by a gap from the rest of the spectrum, we show that one can obtain an error between the final adiabatic eigenstate and the actual time-evolved state which is exponentially small in the evolution time, where this time itself scales as the square of the norm of the time-derivative of the Hamiltonian, divided by the cube of the minimal gap. 
0808.02698	A construction of Frobenius manifolds with logarithmic poles and applications	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Thomas Reichelt	Abstract:  A construction theorem for Frobenius manifolds with logarithmic poles is established. This is a generalization of a theorem of Hertling and Manin. As an application we prove a generalization of the reconstruction theorem of Kontsevich and Manin for projective smooth varieties with convergent Gromov-Witten potential. A second application is a construction of Frobenius manifolds out of a variation of polarized Hodge structures which degenerates along a normal crossing divisor when certain generation conditions are fulfilled. 
0808.02699	Dissociation of quarkonium in hot QCD medium: Modification of the inter-quark potential	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Vineet Agotiya, Vinod Chandra, Binoy Krishna Patra	Abstract:  We have studied the dissociation of heavy quarkonium states in a hot QCD medium by investigating the medium modifications to a heavy quark potential. Our model shows that in-medium modification causes the screening of the charge in contrast to the screening of the range of the potential. We have then employed the medium-modified potential to estimate the dissociation pattern of the charmonium and bottomonium states and also explore how the pattern changes as we go from the perturbative to nonperturbative domain in the Debye mass. The results are in good agreement with the other current theoretical works both from the spectral function analysis and the potential model study. 
0808.02700	Posterior Convergence and Model Estimation in Bayesian Change-point Problems	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Heng Lian	Abstract:  We study the posterior distribution of the Bayesian multiple change-point regression problem when the number and the locations of the change-points are unknown. While it is relatively easy to apply the general theory to obtain the $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ rate up to some logarithmic factor, showing the exact parametric rate of convergence of the posterior distribution requires additional work and assumptions. Additionally, we demonstrate the asymptotic normality of the segment levels under these assumptions. For inferences on the number of change-points, we show that the Bayesian approach can produce a consistent posterior estimate. Finally, we argue that the point-wise posterior convergence property as demonstrated might have bad finite sample performance in that consistent posterior for model selection necessarily implies the maximal squared risk will be asymptotically larger than the optimal $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ rate. This is the Bayesian version of the same phenomenon that has been noted and studied by other authors. 
0808.02701	Getting Information on Independently Prepared Quantum States -- When Are Individual Measurements as Powerful as Joint Measurements?	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Chi-Hang Fred Fung, H. F. Chau	Abstract:  Given a composite quantum system in which the states of the subsystems are independently (but not necessarily identically) prepared, we construct separate measurements on the subsystems from any given joint measurement such that the former always give at least as large information as the latter. This construction offers new insights into the understanding of measurements on this type of composite systems. Moreover, this construction essentially proves the intuition that separate measurements on the subsystems are sufficient to extract the maximal information about the separately prepared subsystems, thus making a joint measurement unnecessary. Furthermore, our result implies that individual attacks are as powerful as collective attacks in obtaining information on the raw key in quantum key distribution. 
0808.02702	$J/ψ$ suppression and $p_T$ spectra in RHIC and LHC energy collisions	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:A. K. Chaudhuri	Abstract:  In a hydrodynamic model, we have studied $J/ψ$ production in Au+Au/Cu+Cu collisions at RHIC energy $\sqrt{s}$=200 GeV. At the initial time, $J/ψ$'s are randomly distributed in the fluid. As the fluid evolve in time, the free streaming $J/ψ$'s are dissolved if the local fluid temperature exceeds a threshold temperature $T_{J/ψ}$. Sequential melting of charmonium states ($χ_c$, $ψ\prime$ and $J/ψ$), with melting temperatures $T_{χ_c}=T_{ψ\prime} \approx 1.2T_c$, $T_{J/ψ} \approx2T_c$ and feed-down fraction $F\approx 0.3$, explains the PHENIX data on the centrality dependence of $J/ψ$ suppression in Au+Au collisions. $J/ψ$ $p_T$ spectra and the nuclear modification factor in Au+Au collisions are also well explained in the model. The model however over predict centrality dependence of $J/ψ$ suppression in Cu+Cu collisions by 20-30%. The $J/ψ$ $p_T$ spectra are under predicted by 20-30%. The model predict that in central Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energy, $\sqrt{s}$=5500 GeV, $J/ψ$'s are suppressed by a factor of $\sim$ 10. The model predicted $J/ψ$ $p_T$ distribution in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC is similar to that in Au+Au collisions at RHIC. 
0808.02703	Low-Signal-Energy Asymptotics of Capacity and Mutual Information for the Discrete-Time Poisson Channel	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Alfonso Martinez	Abstract:  The first terms of the low-signal-energy asymptotics for the mutual information in the discrete-time Poisson channel are derived and compared to an asymptotic expression of the capacity. In the presence of non-zero additive noise (either Poisson or geometric), the mutual information is concave at zero signal-energy and the minimum energy per bit is not attained at zero capacity. Fixed signal constellations which scale with the signal energy do not attain the minimum energy per bit. The minimum energy per bit is zero when additive Poisson noise is present and $\ew\log 2$ when additive geometric noise of mean $\ew$ is present. 
0808.02704	Bound states and scattering lengths of three two-component particles with zero-range interactions under one-dimensional confinement	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:O. I. Kartavtsev, A. V. Malykh, S. A. Sofianos	Abstract:  The universal three-body dynamics in ultra-cold binary gases confined to one-dimensional motion are studied. The three-body binding energies and the (2 + 1)-scattering lengths are calculated for two identical particles of mass $m$ and a different one of mass $m_1$, which interactions is described in the low-energy limit by zero-range potentials. The critical values of the mass ratio $m/m_1$, at which the three-body states arise and the (2 + 1)-scattering length equals zero, are determined both for zero and infinite interaction strength $λ_1$ of the identical particles. A number of exact results are enlisted and asymptotic dependences both for $m/m_1 \to \infty$ and $λ_1 \to -\infty$ are derived. Combining the numerical and analytical results, a schematic diagram showing the number of the three-body bound states and the sign of the (2 + 1)-scattering length in the plane of the mass ratio and interaction-strength ratio is deduced. The results provide a description of the homogeneous and mixed phases of atoms and molecules in dilute binary quantum gases. 
0808.02705	Formal topology and constructive mathematics: the Gelfand and Stone-Yosida representation theorems	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Thierry Coquand, Bas Spitters	Abstract:  We present a constructive proof of the Stone-Yosida representation theorem for Riesz spaces motivated by considerations from formal topology. This theorem is used to derive a representation theorem for f-algebras. In turn, this theorem implies the Gelfand representation theorem for C*-algebras of operators on Hilbert spaces as formulated by Bishop and Bridges. Our proof is shorter, clearer, and we avoid the use of approximate eigenvalues. 
0808.02706	Re-analysis of data on a0(1450) and a0(980)	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:D.V. Bugg (Queen Mary, University of London, UK)    	Abstract:  Four sets of data determining parameters of a0(1450) and a0(980) are re-analysed. These are Crystal Barrel data for pbar-p annihilation at rest to eta-pizero-pizero in (i) liquid hydrogen and (ii) gas, and to (iii) K0_L-picharged-Kcharged and (iv) omega piplus-piminus-pizero (mostly omega-rho-pi). Dispersive corrections due to opening of inelastic thresholds are treated fully. This stabilises parameters of a0(1450) substantially. The mass of its peak is 1448 +-13(stat) +- 25(syst) MeV and its mean full width at half maximum is 192 +-9 +-9 MeV. The pole position is 1432 +- 13 +- 25 - i(98 +-5 +-5) MeV. At the peak, eta-pi, omega-rho and a0(980)-sigma decay intensities are in the ratios 1 : 9.2 +- 0.8 +- 1.3 : 3.1 +- 0.2 +- 0.9. There is no evidence for a separate a0 near 1300 MeV claimed by Obelix. Parameters of a0(980) are updated to M = 987.4 +- 1.0 +- 3.0 MeV, g^2(eta-pi) = 0.164 +- 0.007 +- 0.010 GeV^2, g^2(KK)/g^2(eta-pi) = 1.05 +- 0.07 +- 0.05. The nature of the prominent J^{PC} = 0^{-+} signal in omega-rho is also clarified. 
0808.02707	A Note on Symmetries of WDVV Equations	Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)	Authors:Yu-Tung Chen, Niann-Chern Lee, Ming-Hsien Tu	Abstract:  We investigate symmetries of Witten-Dijkgraaf-E.Verlinde-H.Verlinde (WDVV) equations proposed by Dubrovin from bi-hamiltonian point of view. These symmetries can be viewed as canonical Miura transformations between genus-zero bi-hamiltonian systems of hydrodynamic type. In particular,we show that the moduli space of two-primary models under symmetries of WDVV can be characterized by the polytropic exponent $h$. Furthermore, we also discuss the transformation properties of free energy at genus-one level. 
0808.02708	Gauge fields in accelerated frames	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:F. Lenz	Abstract:  Quantized fields in accelerated frames (Rindler spaces) with emphasis on gauge fields are investigated. Important properties of the dynamics in Rindler spaces are shown to follow from the scale invariance of the corresponding Hamiltonians. Origin and consequences of this extraordinary property of Hamiltonians in Rindler spaces are elucidated. Characteristics of the Unruh radiation, the appearance of a photon condensate and the interaction energy of vector and scalar static charges are discussed and implications for Yang-Mills theories and QCD in Rindler spaces are indicated. 
0808.02709	Invariant manifolds for analytic dynamical systems over ultrametric fields	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Helge Glockner	Abstract:  We give an exposition of the theory of invariant manifolds around a fixed point, in the case of time-discrete, analytic dynamical systems over a complete ultrametric field K. Typically, we consider an analytic manifold M modelled on an ultrametric Banach space over K, an analytic self-map f of M, and a fixed point p of f. Under suitable conditions on the tangent map of f at p, we construct a centre-stable manifold, a centre manifold, respectively, an r-stable manifold around p, for a given positive real number r not exceeding 1. The invariant manifolds are useful in the theory of Lie groups over local fields, where they allow results to be extended to the case of positive characteristic which previously were only available in characteristic zero (i.e., for p-adic Lie groups). 
0808.02710	Local Convergence and Global Diversity: From Interpersonal to Social Influence	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:Andreas Flache (1), Michael W. Macy (2) ((1) Department of Sociology, University of Groningen, (2) Department of Sociology, Cornell University)    	Abstract:  Axelrod (1997) showed how local convergence in cultural influence can preserve cultural diversity. We argue that central implications of Axelrod's model may change profoundly, if his model is integrated with the assumption of social influence as assumed by an earlier generation of modelers. Axelrod and all follow up studies employed instead the assumption that influence is interpersonal (dyadic). We show how the combination of social influence with homophily allows solving two important problems. Our integration of social influence yields monoculture in small societies and diversity increasing in population size, consistently with empirical evidence but contrary to earlier models. The second problem was identified by Klemm et al.(2003a,b), an extremely narrow window of noise levels in which diversity with local convergence can be obtained at all. Our model with social influence generates stable diversity with local convergence across a much broader interval of noise levels than models based on interpersonal influence. 
0808.02711	A search for rapid pulsations in the magnetic cool chemically peculiar star HD3980	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:V.G. Elkin, D.W. Kurtz, L.M. Freyhammer, S. Hubrig, G. Mathys	Abstract:  The Ap star HD3980 appears to be a promising roAp candidate based on its fundamental parameters, leading us to search for rapid pulsations with the VLT UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES). A precise Hipparcos parallax and estimated temperature of 8100K place HD3980 in the middle of the theoretical instability strip for rapidly oscillating Ap stars, about halfway through its main sequence evolution stage. The star has a strong, variable magnetic field, as is typical of the cool magnetic Ap stars. Dipole model parameters were determined from VLT observations using FORS1. From Doppler shift measurements for individual spectral lines of rare earth elements and the H-alpha line core, we find no pulsations above 20-30 m/s. This result is corroborated by inspection of lines of several other chemical elements, as well as with crosscorrelation for long spectral regions with the average spectrum as a template. Abundances of chemical elements were determined and show larger than solar abundances of rare earth elements. Further, ionisation disequilibria for the first two ionised states of Nd and Pr are detected. We also find that the star has a strong overabundance of manganese, which is typical for much hotter HgMn and other Bp stars. Line profile variability with the rotation period was detected for the majority of chemical species. 
0808.02712	Magnetic support of the optical emission line filaments in NGC 1275	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A.C. Fabian (1), R.M. Johnstone (1), J.S. Sanders (1), C.J. Conselice (2), C.S. Crawford (1), J.S. Gallagher III (3), E. Zweibel (3) ((1) Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge, (2) University of Nottingham, (3) University of Wisconsin)    	Abstract:  The giant elliptical galaxy NGC 1275, at the centre of the Perseus cluster, is surrounded by a well-known giant nebulosity of emission-line filaments, which are plausibly about >10^8 yr old. The filaments are dragged out from the centre of the galaxy by the radio bubbles rising buoyantly in the hot intracluster gas before later falling back. They act as dramatic markers of the feedback process by which energy is transferred from the central massive black hole to the surrounding gas. The mechanism by which the filaments are stabilized against tidal shear and dissipation into the surrounding 4x10^7 K gas has been unclear. Here we report new observations that resolve thread-like structures in the filaments. Some threads extend over 6 kpc, yet are only 70 pc wide. We conclude that magnetic fields in the threads, in pressure balance with the surrounding gas, stabilize the filaments, so allowing a large mass of cold gas to accumulate and delay star formation. 
0808.02713	Recognizing trace graphs of closed braids	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:T.Fiedler, V.Kurlin	Abstract:  To a closed braid in a solid torus we associate a trace graph in a thickened torus in such a way that closed braids are isotopic if and only if their trace graphs can be related by trihedral and tetraherdal moves. For closed braids with a fixed number of strands, we recognize trace graphs up to isotopy and trihedral moves in polynomial time with respect to the braid length. 
0808.02714	Chiral Symmetry breaking in Three Dimensional QED	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Costas Strouthos, John B. Kogut	Abstract:  Over the past few years three dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics (QED$_3$) has attracted a lot of attention, because it may be an effective theory for the underdoped and non-superconducting region of the phase diagram of high $T_c$ cuprate compounds. We present results from lattice simulations of the non-compact version of the theory in order to address the issue of whether chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken when the number of fermion flavours $N_f$ is less than a critical value $N_{fc}$. Our results provide strong evidence that QED$_3$ is chirally symmetric for $N_f \geq 1.5$, implying that a pseudogap phase separates the superconducting phase from the antiferromagnetic phase. 
0808.02715	Thermodynamics of the Spin Luttinger-Liquid in a Model Ladder Material	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Ch. Rüegg, K. Kiefer, B. Thielemann, D. F. McMorrow, V. Zapf, B. Normand, M. B. Zvonarev, P. Bouillot, C. Kollath, T. Giamarchi, S. Capponi, D. Poilblanc, D. Biner, K. W. Krämer	Abstract:  The phase diagram in temperature and magnetic field of the metal-organic, two-leg, spin-ladder compound (C5H12N)2CuBr4 is studied by measurements of the specific heat and the magnetocaloric effect. We demonstrate the presence of an extended spin Luttinger-liquid phase between two field-induced quantum critical points and over a broad range of temperature. Based on an ideal spin-ladder Hamiltonian, comprehensive numerical modelling of the ladder specific heat yields excellent quantitative agreement with the experimental data across the complete phase diagram. 
0808.02716	Cusp areas of Farey manifolds and applications to knot theory	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:David Futer, Efstratia Kalfagianni, Jessica S. Purcell	Abstract:  This paper gives the first explicit, two-sided estimates on the cusp area of once-punctured torus bundles, 4-punctured sphere bundles, and 2-bridge link complements. The input for these estimates is purely combinatorial data coming from the Farey tesselation of the hyperbolic plane. The bounds on cusp area lead to explicit bounds on the volume of Dehn fillings of these manifolds, for example sharp bounds on volumes of hyperbolic closed 3-braids in terms of the Schreier normal form of the associated braid word. Finally, these results are applied to derive relations between the Jones polynomial and the volume of hyperbolic knots, and to disprove a related conjecture. 
0808.02717	A note on the quantum-mechanical Ricci flow	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:J.M. Isidro, J.L.G. Santander, P. Fernandez de Cordoba	Abstract:  We obtain Schroedinger quantum mechanics from Perelman's functional and from the Ricci flow equations of a conformally flat Riemannian metric on a closed 2-dimensional configuration space. We explore links with the recently discussed "emergent quantum mechanics". 
0808.02718	Effects of Supernova Feedback on the Formation of Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Cecilia Scannapieco (1), Patricia B. Tissera (2), Simon D.M. White (1), Volker Springel (1) ((1) MPA-Garching; (2) IAFE-Buenos Aires)    	Abstract:  We study the effects of Supernova (SN) feedback on the formation of galaxies using hydrodynamical simulations in a Lambda-CDM cosmology. We use an extended version of the code GADGET-2 which includes chemical enrichment and energy feedback by Type II and Type Ia SN, metal-dependent cooling and a multiphase model for the gas component. We focus on the effects of SN feedback on the star formation process, galaxy morphology, evolution of the specific angular momentum and chemical properties. We find that SN feedback plays a fundamental role in galaxy evolution, producing a self-regulated cycle for star formation, preventing the early consumption of gas and allowing disks to form at late times. The SN feedback model is able to reproduce the expected dependence on virial mass, with less massive systems being more strongly affected. 
0808.02719	Junctions of anyonic Luttinger wires	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Brando Bellazzini, Pasquale Calabrese, Mihail Mintchev	Abstract:  We present an extended study of anyonic Luttinger liquids wires jointing at a single point. The model on the full line is solved with bosonization and the junction of an arbitrary number of wires is treated imposing boundary conditions that preserve exact solvability in the bosonic language. This allows to reach, in the low momentum regime, some of the critical fixed points found with the electronic boundary conditions. The stability of all the fixed points is discussed. 
0808.02720	Quantum Phase Transition in a Graphene Model	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Simon Hands, Costas Strouthos	Abstract:  We present results for the equation of state of a graphene-like model in an effort to understand the properties of its quantum phase transition. The N_f fermion species interact through a three dimensional instantaneous Coulomb potential. Since there are no reliable analytical tools that work for all values of N_f and the coupling constant g, we rely on Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the critical properties of the model near the phase transition. We consider the four-component formulation for the fermion fields, which arises naturally as the continuum limit of the staggered fermion construction in (2+1) dimensions. In the limit of infinitely strong Coulomb interaction, the system undergoes a quantum phase transition at a critical number of fermion species N_fc ~ 4.7. We also calculate the values of the critical exponents at the quantum phase transition. 
0808.02721	Nonequilibrium critical relaxations of the order parameter and energy in the two-dimensional ferromagnetic Potts model	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Keekwon Nam, Bongsoo Kim, Sung Jong Lee	Abstract:  The static and dynamic critical properties of the ferromagnetic q-state Potts models on a square lattice with q = 2 and 3 are numerically studied via the nonequilibrium relaxation method. The relaxation behavior of both the order parameter and energy as well as that of the second moments are investigated, from which static and dynamic critical exponents can be obtained. We find that the static exponents thus obtained from the relaxation of the order parameter and energy together with the second moments of the order parameter exhibit a close agreement with the exact exponents, especially for the case of q = 2 (Ising) model, when care is taken in the choice of the initial states for the relaxation of the second moments. As for the case of q = 3, the estimates for the static exponents become less accurate but still exhibit reasonable agreement with the exactly known static exponents. The dynamic critical exponent for q = 2 (Ising) model is estimated from the relaxation of the second moments of the order parameter with mixed initial conditions to give z(q = 2) = 2.1668(19). 
0808.02722	Modelling the evolution and nucleosynthesis of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:O. R. Pols, R. G. Izzard, M. Lugaro, S. E. de Mink	Abstract:  We present the results of binary population simulations of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. We show that nitrogen and fluorine are useful tracers of the origin of CEMP stars, and conclude that the observed paucity of very nitrogen-rich stars puts strong constraints on possible modifications of the initial mass function at low metallicity. The large number fraction of CEMP stars may instead require much more efficient dredge-up from low-metallicity asymptotic giant branch stars. 
0808.02723	Smoothing noisy spectroscopic data with many-knot spline method	Spectral Theory (math.SP)	Authors:M.H.Zhu, L.G.Liu, D.X.Qi, Z.You, A.A.Xu	Abstract:  In this paper, we present the development of a many-knot spline method derived to remove the statistical noise in the spectroscopic data. This method is an expansion of the B-spline method. Compared to the B-spline method, the many-knot spline method is significantly faster. 
0808.02724	Bosons in Rapid Rotation	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Jakob Yngvason	Abstract:  Some recent progress in the mathematical physics of rapidly rotating, dilute Bose gases in anharmonic traps is reviewed. 
0808.02725	Perturbation method for determining the group of invariance of hierarchical models	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Tomonari Sei, Satoshi Aoki, Akimichi Takemura	Abstract:  We propose a perturbation method for determining the (largest) group of invariance of a toric ideal defined in Aoki and Takemura [2008a]. In the perturbation method, we investigate how a generic element in the row space of the configuration defining a toric ideal is mapped by a permutation of the indeterminates. Compared to the proof in Aoki and Takemura [2008a] which was based on stabilizers of a subset of indeterminates, the perturbation method gives a much simpler proof of the group of invariance. In particular, we determine the group of invariance for a general hierarchical model of contingency tables in statistics, under the assumption that the numbers of the levels of the factors are generic. We prove that it is a wreath product indexed by a poset related to the intersection poset of the maximal interaction effects of the model. 
0808.02726	Relaxation dynamics and interrupted coarsening in irrationally frustrated superconducting arrays	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Gun Sang Jeon, Sung Jong Lee, Bongsoo Kim, M. Y. Choi	Abstract:  Equilibrium and non-equilibrium relaxation behaviors of two-dimensional superconducting arrays are investigated via numerical simulations at low temperatures in the presence of incommensurate transverse magnetic fields, with frustration parameter f= (3-\sqrt{5})/2. We find that the non-equilibrium relaxation, beginning with random initial states quenched to low temperatures, exhibits a three-stage relaxation of chirality autocorrelations. At the early stage, the relaxation is found to be described by the von Schweidler form. Then it exhibits power-law behavior in the intermediate time scale and faster decay in the long-time limit, which together can be fitted to the Ogielski form; for longer waiting times, this crosses over to a stretched exponential form. We argue that the power-law behavior in the intermediate time scale may be understood as a consequence of the coarsening behavior, leading to the local vortex order corresponding to f=2/5 ground-state configurations. High mobility of the vortices in the domain boundaries, generating slow wandering motion of the domain walls, may provide mechanism of dynamic heterogeneity and account for the long-time stretched exponential relaxation behavior. It is expected that such meandering fluctuations of the low-temperature structure give rise to finite resistivity at those low temperatures; this appears consistent with the zero-temperature resistive transition in the limit of irrational frustration. 
0808.02727	Passive Sliders and Scaling: from Cusps to Divergences	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Apoorva Nagar, Mustansir Barma	Abstract:  The steady state reached by a system of particles sliding down a fluctuating surface has interesting properties. Particle clusters form and break rapidly, leading to a broad distribution of sizes and large fluctuations. The density-density correlation function is a singular scaling function of the separation and system size. A simple mapping is shown to take a configuration of sliding hard-core particles with mutual exclusion (a system which shows a cusp singularity) to a configuration with multiparticle occupancy. For the mapped system, a calculation of the correlation function shows that it is of the same scaling form again, but with a stronger singularity (a divergence) of the sort observed earlier for noninteracting passive particles. 
0808.02728	Charged rotating black holes in six-dimensional gauged supergravity	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:David D. K. Chow	Abstract:  We obtain non-extremal charged rotating black holes in six-dimensional SU(2) gauged supergravity with two independent angular momenta and one U(1) charge. These include supersymmetric black holes without naked closed timelike curves. 
0808.02729	Multiplicity one theorem for (GL(n+1,R),GL(n,R))	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Avraham Aizenbud, Dmitry Gourevitch	Abstract:  Let F be either R or C. Consider the standard embedding GL(n,F)<GL(n+1,F) and the action of GL(n,F) on GL(n+1,F) by conjugation. In this paper we show that any GL(n,F)-invariant distribution on GL(n+1,F) is invariant with respect to transposition. We show that this implies that for any irreducible admissible smooth Frechet representations $π$ of GL(n+1,F) and $τ$ of GL(n,F), $$dim Hom_{GL(n,F)}(π,τ) \leq 1.$$ For p-adic fields those results were proven in [AGRS]. 
0808.02730	On the Advancements of Conformal Transformations and their Associated Symmetries in Geometry and Theoretical Physics	History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)	Authors:H.A. Kastrup	Abstract:  The historical developments of conformal transformations and symmetries are sketched: Their origin from stereographic projections of the globe, their blossoming in two dimensions within the field of analytic complex functions, the generic role of transformations by reciprocal radii in dimensions higher than two and their linearization in terms of polyspherical coordinates by Darboux, Weyl's attempt to extend General Relativity, the slow rise of finite dimensional conformal transformations in classical field theories and the problem of their interpretation, then since about 1970 the rapid spread of their acceptance for asymptotic and structural problems in quantum field theories and beyond, up to the current AdS/CFT conjecture. The occasion for the present article: hundred years ago Bateman and Cunningham discovered the form invariance of Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism with respect to conformal space-time transformations. 
0808.02731	Efficient rare-event simulation for the maximum of heavy-tailed random walks	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Jose Blanchet, Peter Glynn	Abstract:  Let $(X_n:n\geq 0)$ be a sequence of i.i.d. r.v.'s with negative mean. Set $S_0=0$ and define $S_n=X_1+... +X_n$. We propose an importance sampling algorithm to estimate the tail of $M=\max \{S_n:n\geq 0\}$ that is strongly efficient for both light and heavy-tailed increment distributions. Moreover, in the case of heavy-tailed increments and under additional technical assumptions, our estimator can be shown to have asymptotically vanishing relative variance in the sense that its coefficient of variation vanishes as the tail parameter increases. A key feature of our algorithm is that it is state-dependent. In the presence of light tails, our procedure leads to Siegmund's (1979) algorithm. The rigorous analysis of efficiency requires new Lyapunov-type inequalities that can be useful in the study of more general importance sampling algorithms. 
0808.02732	Collective generation of quantum states of light by entangled atoms	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:D. Porras, J. I. Cirac	Abstract:  We present a theoretical framework to describe the collective emission of light by entangled atomic states. Our theory applies to the low excitation regime, where most of the atoms are initially in the ground state, and relies on a bosonic description of the atomic excitations. In this way, the problem of light emission by an ensemble of atoms can be solved exactly, including dipole-dipole interactions and multiple light scattering. Explicit expressions for the emitted photonic states are obtained in several situations, such as those of atoms in regular lattices and atomic vapors. We determine the directionality of the photonic beam, the purity of the photonic state, and the renormalization of the emission rates. We also show how to observe collective phenomena with ultracold atoms in optical lattices, and how to use these ideas to generate photonic states that are useful in the context of quantum information. 
0808.02733	Long term radio variability of AGN	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:T. Hovatta, M. Tornikoski, H.J. Lehto, E. Nieppola, E. Valtaoja, M. lainela, I. Torniainen, A. Lähteenmäki, M.F. Aller, H.D. Aller	Abstract:  A large number of AGN have been monitored for nearly 30 years at 22, 37 and 87 GHz in Metsähovi Radio Observatory. These data were combined with lower frequency 4.8, 8.0 and 14.5 GHz data from the University of Michigan Radio Astronomy Observatory, higher frequency data at 90 and 230 GHz from SEST, and supplementary higher frequency data from the literature to study the long-term variability of a large sample of AGN. Both the characteristics of individual flares from visual inspection and statistically-determined variability timescales as a function of frequency and optical class type were determined. Based on past behaviour, predictions of sources expected to exhibit large flares in 2008--2009 appropriate for study by GLAST and other instruments are made. The need for long-term data for properly understanding source behaviour is emphasised. 
0808.02734	Elasticity of Spider dragline Silks Viewed as Nematics: Yielding Induced by Isotropic-Nematic Phase Transition	Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)	Authors:Lin-ying Cui, Fei Liu, Zhong-can Ou-Yang	Abstract:  Spider dragline silk shows well-known outstanding mechanical properties. However, its sigmoidal shape of the measured stress-strain curves (i.e. the yield) can not be described by classical polymer theories and recent hierarchical chain model. To solve the long lasting problem, we generalized the Maier-Saupe theory of nematics to construct an elastic model for the polypeptide chain network of the dragline silk. The comprehensive agreement between theory and experiments on the stress-strain curve strongly indicates the dragline silks to belong to liquid crystal elastomers. Especially, the remarkable yielding elasticity of the silk is understood for the first time as the force-induced isotropic-nematic phase transition of the chain network. Our theory also predicts a drop of the stress in supercontracted dragline silk, an early found effect of humidity on the mechanical property in many silks. 
0808.02735	Two orbits: When is one in the closure of the other?	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Vladimir L. Popov	Abstract:  Let $G$ be a connected linear algebraic group, let $V$ be a finite dimensional algebraic $G$-module, and let $\mathcal O_1$, $\mathcal O_2$ be two $G$-orbits in $V$. We describe a constructive way to find out whether $\mathcal O_1$ lies in the closure of $\mathcal O_2$ or not. 
0808.02736	Non-Universality of the Specific Heat in Glass Forming Systems	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:H.G.E. Hentschel, Valery Ilyin, Itamar Procaccia	Abstract:  We present new simulation results for the specific heat in a classical model of a binary mixture glass-former in two dimensions. We show that in addition to the formerly observed specific heat peak there is a second peak at lower temperatures which was not observable in earlier simulations. This is a surprise, as most texts on the glass transition expect a single specific heat peak. We explain the physics of the two specific heat peaks by the micro-melting of two types of clusters. While this physics is easily accessible, the consequences are that one should not expect any universality in the temperature dependence of the specific heat in glass formers. 
0808.02737	On free fermions and plane partitions	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:O Foda, M Wheeler, M Zuparic	Abstract:  We use free fermion methods to re-derive a result of Okounkov and Reshetikhin relating charged fermions to random plane partitions, and to extend it to relate neutral fermions to strict plane partitions. 
0808.02738	Correlation effects of exchange splitting and coexistence of spin-density-wave and superconductivity in single crystalline Sr1-xKxFe2As2	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Y. Zhang, J. Wei, H. W. Ou, J. F. Zhao, B. Zhou, F. Chen, M. Xu, C. He, G. Wu, H. Chen, M. Arita, K. Shimada, H. Namatame, M. Taniguchi, X. H. Chen, D. L. Feng	Abstract:  The nature of spin-density wave and its relation with superconductivity are crucial issues in the newly discovered Fe-based high temperature superconductors. Particularly it is unclear whether the superconducting phase and spin density wave (SDW) are truly exclusive from each other as suggested by certain experiments. With angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we here report exchange splittings of the band structures in Sr1-xKxFe2As2 (x=0,0.1,0.2), and the non-rigid-band behaviors of the splitting. Our data on single crystalline superconducting samples unambiguously prove that SDW and superconductivity could coexist in iron-pnictides. 
0808.02739	Temperature and frequency dependent optical properties of ultra-thin Au films	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Tobby Brandt, Martin Hövel, Bruno Gompf, Martin Dressel	Abstract:  While the optical properties of thin metal films are well understood in the visible and near-infrared range, little has been done in the mid- and far-infrared region. Here we investigate ultra-thin gold films prepared on Si(111)(7 x 7) in UHV by measuring in the frequency range between 500 cm-1 and 7000 cm-1 and for temperatures between 300 K and 5 K. The nominal thickness of the gold layers ranges between one monolayer and 9 nm. The frequency and temperature dependences of the thicker films can be well described by the Drude model of a metal, when taking into account classical size effects due to surface scattering. The films below the percolation threshold exhibit a non-metallic behavior: the reflection increases with frequency and decreases with temperature. The frequency dependence can partly be described by a generalized Drude model. The temperature dependence does not follow a simple activation process. For monolayers we observe a transition between surface states around 1100 cm-1. 
0808.02740	A Kind of Compact Quantum Semigroups	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Maysam Maysami Sadr	Abstract:  We show that the quantum family of all maps from a finite space to a finite dimensional compact quantum semigroup has a canonical quantum semigroup structure. 
0808.02741	Entanglement, combinatorics and finite-size effects in spin-chains	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Bernard Nienhuis, Massimo Campostrini, Pasquale Calabrese	Abstract:  We carry out a systematic study of the exact block entanglement in XXZ spin-chain at Delta=-1/2. We present, the first analytic expressions for reduced density matrices of n spins in a chain of length L (for n<=6 and arbitrary but odd L) of a truly interacting model. The entanglement entropy, the moments of the reduced density matrix, and its spectrum are then easily derived. We explicitely construct the "entanglement Hamiltonian" as the logarithm of this matrix. Exploiting the degeneracy of the ground-state, we find the scaling behavior of entanglement of the zero-temperature mixed state. 
0808.02742	J1420--0545: The radio galaxy larger than 3C236	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. Machalski, D. Kozieł-Wierzbowska, M. Jamrozy, D.J. Saikia	Abstract:  We report the discovery of the largest giant radio galaxy, J1420-0545: a FR type II radio source with an angular size of 17.4' identified with an optical galaxy at z=0.3067. Thus, the projected linear size of the radio structure is 4.69 Mpc (if we assume that H_{0}=71 km\s\Mpc, Omega_{m}=0.27, and Omega_Λ=0.73). This makes it larger than 3C236, which is the largest double radio source known to date. New radio observations with the 100 m Effelsberg telescope and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, as well as optical identification with a host galaxy and its optical spectroscopy with the William Herschel Telescope are reported. The spectrum of J1420-0545 is typical of elliptical galaxies in which continuum emission with the characteristic 4000A discontinuity and the H and K absorption lines are dominated by evolved stars. The dynamical age of the source, its jets' power, the energy density, and the equipartition magnetic field are calculated and compared with the corresponding parameters of other giant and normal-sized radio galaxies from a comparison sample. The source is characterized by the exceptionally low density of the surrounding IGM and an unexpectedly high expansion speed of the source along the jet axis. All of these may suggest a large inhomogeneity of the IGM. 
0808.02743	The ground-state magnetic ordering of the spin-1/2 frustrated J1-J2 XXZ model on the square lattice	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:R. Darradi, J. Richter, J. Schulenburg, R.F. Bishop, P.H.Y. Li	Abstract:  Using the coupled-cluster method for infinite lattices and the exact diagonalization method for finite lattices, we study the influence of an exchange anisotropy Delta on the ground-state phase diagram of the spin-1/2 frustrated J1-J2 XXZ antiferromagnet on the square lattice. We find that increasing Delta>1 (i.e. an Ising type easy-axis anisotropy) as well as decreasing Delta<1 (i.e. an XY type easy-plane anisotropy) both lead to a monotonic shrinking of the parameter region of the magnetically disordered quantum phase. Finally, at Delta~1.9 this quantum phase disappears, whereas in pure XY limit (Delta=0) there is still a narrow region around J2 =0.5J1 where the quantum paramagnetic ground-state phase exists. 
0808.02744	Ionization front-driven turbulence in the clumpy interstellar medium	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Thomas Peters, Robi Banerjee, Ralf S. Klessen	Abstract:  We present 3D radiation-gasdynamical simulations of an ionization front running into a dense clump. In our setup, a B0 star irradiates an overdensity which is at a distance of 10 pc and modelled as a supercritical 100 M_sol Bonnor-Ebert sphere. The radiation from the star heats up the gas and creates a shock front that expands into the interstellar medium. The shock compresses the clump material while the ionizing radiation heats it up. The outcome of this "cloud-crushing" process is a fully turbulent gas in the wake of the clump. In the end, the clump entirely dissolves. We propose that this mechanism is very efficient in creating short-living supersonic turbulence in the vicinity of massive stars. 
0808.02745	Static and Impulsive Models of Solar Active Regions	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Patsourakos, J. A. Klimchuk	Abstract:  The physical modeling of active regions (ARs) and of the global coronal is receiving increasing interest lately. Recent attempts to model ARs using static equilibrium models were quite successful in reproducing AR images of hot soft X-ray (SXR) loops. They however failed to predict the bright EUV warm loops permeating ARs: the synthetic images were dominated by intense footpoint emission. We demonstrate that this failure is due to the very weak dependence of loop temperature on loop length which cannot simultaneously account for both hot and warm loops in the same AR. We then consider time-dependent AR models based on nanoflare heating. We demonstrate that such models can simultaneously reproduce EUV and SXR loops in ARs. Moreover, they predict radial intensity variations consistent with the localized core and extended emissions in SXR and EUV AR observations respectively. We finally show how the AR morphology can be used as a gauge of the properties (duration, energy, spatial dependence, repetition time) of the impulsive heating. 
0808.02746	Relation Between Stellar Mass and Star Formation Activity in Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Bahram Mobasher (1), T. Dahlen (2), A. Hopkins (3), N. Z. Scoville (4), P. Capak (5), R. M. Rich (6), D. B. Sanders (7), Eva Schinnerer (8), Olivier Ilbert (7), Mara Salvato (4), Kartik Sheth (5) ((1)University of California, Riverside; (2)STScI; (3)University of Sydney; (4)Caltech; (5)Spitzer Science Center; (6)University of California, Los Angles; (7)University of Hawaii; (8)Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg)    	Abstract:  For a mass-selected sample of 66544 galaxies with photometric redshifts from the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS), we examine the evolution of star formation activity as a function of stellar mass in galaxies. We estimate the cosmic star formation rates (SFR) over the range 0.2 < z < 1.2, using the rest-frame 2800 A flux (corrected for extinction). We find the mean SFR to be a strong function of the galactic stellar mass at any given redshift, with massive systems (log (M/M(Sun)) > 10.5) contributing less (by a factor of ~ 5) to the total star formation rate density (SFRD). Combining data from the COSMOS and Gemini Deep Deep Survey (GDDS), we extend the SFRD-z relation as a function of stellar mass to z~2. For massive galaxies, we find a steep increase in the SFRD-z relation to z~2; for the less massive systems, the SFRD which also increases from z=0 to 1, levels off at z~1. This implies that the massive systems have had their major star formation activity at earlier epochs (z > 2) than the lower mass galaxies. We study changes in the SFRDs as a function of both redshift and stellar mass for galaxies of different spectral types. We find that the slope of the SFRD-z relation for different spectral type of galaxies is a strong function of their stellar mass. For low and intermediate mass systems, the main contribution to the cosmic SFRD comes from the star-forming galaxies while, for more massive systems, the evolved galaxies are the most dominant population. 
0808.02747	Unifying Practical Uncertainty Representations: I. Generalized P-Boxes	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Sebastien Destercke, Didier Dubois, Eric Chojnacki	Abstract:  There exist several simple representations of uncertainty that are easier to handle than more general ones. Among them are random sets, possibility distributions, probability intervals, and more recently Ferson's p-boxes and Neumaier's clouds. Both for theoretical and practical considerations, it is very useful to know whether one representation is equivalent to or can be approximated by other ones. In this paper, we define a generalized form of usual p-boxes. These generalized p-boxes have interesting connections with other previously known representations. In particular, we show that they are equivalent to pairs of possibility distributions, and that they are special kinds of random sets. They are also the missing link between p-boxes and clouds, which are the topic of the second part of this study.

We describe some elementary properties of this function and use them to check some of the formulas in the mentioned table. 
0808.02752	New stable phase of non uniform black strings in ${AdS}_d$	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:T. Delsate	Abstract:  We consider the non uniform $AdS$ black string equations in arbitrary number of dimension in a perturbative approach up to order 2 and in a non perturbative. We restrict the study in the perturbative approach to the backreacting modes, since they provide the first relevant corrections on the thermodynamical quantities of the solutions. We also present some preliminary results in the construction of non-perturbative solutions, in particular, we present a first part of the non uniform - uniform black string phase diagram. Our results suggests the existence of a new stable phase for $AdS$ non uniform black strings, namely long non uniform black string, with the extra direction length of the order of the $AdS$ curvature. 
0808.02753	Exterior algebras and two conjectures on finite abelian groups	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Tao Feng, Zhi-Wei Sun, Qing Xiang	Abstract:  Let G be a finite abelian group with |G|>1. Let a_1,...,a_k be k distinct elements of G and let b_1,...,b_k be (not necessarily distinct) elements of G, where k is a positive integer smaller than the least prime divisor of |G|. We show that there is a permutation $π$ on {1,...,k} such that a_1b_{π(1)},...,a_kb_{π(k)} are distinct, provided that any other prime divisor of |G| (if there is any) is greater than k!. This in particular confirms the Dasgupta-Karolyi-Serra-Szegedy conjecture for abelian p-groups. We also pose a new conjecture involving determinants and characters, and show that its validity implies Snevily's conjecture for abelian groups of odd order. Our methods involve exterior algebras and characters.

Kasting, G. Laughlin, B. Macintosh, M. Marley, G. Melnick, D. Monet, C. Noecker, S. Peale, A. Quirrenbach, S. Seager, J. Winn	Abstract:  This is a scientific strategy for the detection and characterization of extrasolar planets; that is, planets orbiting other stars. As such, it maps out over a 15-year horizon the techniques and capabilities required to detect and measure the properties of planets as small as Earth around stars as large as our own Sun. It shows how the technology pieces and their development fit together to achieve the primary goal of the strategy: if planets like Earth exist around stars within some tens of light years of our own Solar System, those planets will be found and their basic properties characterized. Essential to this strategy is not only the search for and examination of individual planets, but also a knowledge of the arrangement, or architecture, of planetary systems around as large a number of stars as possible; this is the second goal of the strategy. The final goal of the strategy is the study of disks around stars, important both to understand the implications of the variety of exoplanet systems for planet formation, and to determine how many nearby stars have environments around them clean enough of debris that planets may be sought and, if found, characterized. 
0808.02755	Exponential sums nondegenerate relative to a lattice	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Alan Adolphson, Steven Sperber	Abstract:  Our previous theorems on exponential sums often did not apply or did not give sharp results when certain powers of a variable appearing in the polynomial were divisible by p. We remedy that defect in this paper by systematically applying "p-power reduction," making it possible to strengthen and extend our earlier results. 
0808.02756	Electrical probing of the spin conductance of mesoscopic cavities	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:I. Adagideli, J.H. Bardarson, Ph. Jacquod	Abstract:  We investigate spin-dependent transport in three--terminal mesoscopic cavities with spin--orbit coupling. Focusing on the inverse spin Hall effect, we show how injecting a pure spin current or a polarized current from one terminal generates additional charge current and/or voltage across the two output terminals. This allows to extract the spin conductance of the cavity from two purely electrical measurements on the output. We use random matrix theory to show that the spin conductance of chaotic ballistic cavities fluctuates universally about zero mesoscopic average and describe experimental implementations of mesoscopic spin to charge current converters. 
0808.02757	The evolution of anisotropic structures and turbulence in the multi-dimensional Burgers equation	Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)	Authors:S.N. Gurbatov, A.Yu. Moshkov, A. Noullez	Abstract:  The goal of the present paper is the investigation of the evolution of anisotropic regular structures and turbulence at large Reynolds number in the multi-dimensional Burgers equation. We show that we have local isotropization of the velocity and potential fields at small scale inside cellular zones. For periodic waves, we have simple decay inside of a frozen structure. The global structure at large times is determined by the initial correlations, and for short range correlated field, we have isotropization of turbulence. The other limit we consider is the final behavior of the field, when the processes of nonlinear and harmonic interactions are frozen, and the evolution of the field is determined only by the linear dissipation.

Abu-shady	Abstract:  The extended chiral sigma model with quark fields and elementary pion and sigma fields is used to describe static nucleon properties. The field equations have been solved in coherent pair approximation. Better results are obtained for nucleon properties in comparison with previous work and reasonably agree with data. 
0808.02759	Anharmonic effect on lattice distortion, orbital ordering and magnetic properties in Cs2AgF4	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Da-Yong Liu, Feng Lu, Liang-Jian Zou	Abstract:  We develop the cluster self-consistent field method incorporating both electronic and lattice degrees of freedom to study the origin of ferromagnetism in Cs$_{2}$AgF$_{4}$. After self-consistently determining the harmonic and anharmonic Jahn-Teller distortions, we show that the anharmonic distortion stabilizes the staggered x$^{2}$-z$^{2}$/y$^{2}$-z$^{2}$ orbital and ferromagnetic ground state, rather than the antiferromagnetic one. The amplitudes of lattice distortions, Q$_{2}$ and Q$_{3}$, the magnetic coupling strengthes, J$_{x,y}$, and the magnetic moment, are in good agreement with the experimental observation. 
0808.02760	Force and length-dependent catastrophe activities explain interphase microtubule organization in fission yeast	Cell Behavior (q-bio.CB)	Authors:Dietrich Foethke, Tatyana Makushok, Damian Brunner, Francois Nedelec	Abstract:  The cytoskeleton is essential for the maintenance of cell morphology in eukaryotes. In fission yeast for example, polarized growth sites are organized by actin whereas microtubules (MT) acting upstream control where growth occurs (La Carbona et al, 2006). Growth is limited to the cell poles when MTs undergo catastrophes there and not elsewhere on the cortex (Brunner and Nurse, 2000). Here we report that the modulation of MT dynamics by forces as observed in vitro (Dogterom and Yurke, 1997; Janson et al, 2003) can quantitatively explain the localization of MT catastro-phes in S. pombe. However, we found that it is necessary to add length-dependent catastrophe rates to make the model fully consistent with other measured traits of MTs. This result demonstrates the possibility that MTs together with associated proteins such as kinesins having a depolymerization activity can reliably mark the tips of the cell. 
0808.02761	On almost universal mixed sums of squares and triangular numbers	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Ben Kane, Zhi-Wei Sun	Abstract:  In 1997 K. Ono and K. Soundararajan [Invent. Math. 130(1997)] proved that under the generalized Riemann hypothesis any positive odd integer greater than 2719 can be represented by the famous Ramanujan form $x^2+y^2+10z^2$, equivalently the form $2x^2+5y^2+4T_z$ represents all integers greater than 1359, where $T_z$ denotes the triangular number $z(z+1)/2$. Given positive integers $a,b,c$ we employ modular forms and the theory of quadratic forms to determine completely when the general form $ax^2+by^2+cT_z$ represents sufficiently large integers and establish similar results for the forms $ax^2+bT_y+cT_z$ and $aT_x+bT_y+cT_z$. Here are some consequences of our main theorems: (i) All sufficiently large odd numbers have the form $2ax^2+y^2+z^2$ if and only if all prime divisors of $a$ are congruent to 1 modulo 4. (ii) The form $ax^2+y^2+T_z$ is almost universal (i.e., it represents sufficiently large integers) if and only if each odd prime divisor of $a$ is congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 8. (iii) $ax^2+T_y+T_z$ is almost universal if and only if all odd prime divisors of $a$ are congruent to 1 modulo 4. (iv) When $v_2(a)\not=3$, the form $aT_x+T_y+T_z$ is almost universal if and only if all odd prime divisors of $a$ are congruent to 1 modulo 4 and $v_2(a)\not=5,7,...$, where $v_2(a)$ is the 2-adic order of $a$.

0808.02763	Superconducting Properties of Two-Orbital t-t'-J-J' Models	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Feng Lu, Liang-Jian Zou	Abstract:  Motivated by the recent contradiction of the superconducting pairing symmetry in the angle-resolved photoemission spectra (ARPES) and the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data in the FeAs superconductors, we present the theoretical results on the phase diagram, the temperature dependent Fermi surfaces in normal state, the ARPES character of quasiparticles and the spin-lattice relaxation 1/T$_{1}$ of the two-orbital t-t$^{'}$-J-J$^{'}$ models. Our results show that most of the properties observed in iron-based superconductors could be comprehensively understood in the present scenario qualitatively, indicating that the pairing symmetry of the ironpnictides is anisotropic nodeless s-wave, mainly originating from the band structures and the Fermi surface topology. 
0808.02764	Comment on "Generating Unexpected Spin Echoes in Dipolar Solids with Pi Pulses" arXiv:0705.0667	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Patricia R. Levstein, M. Belen Franzoni	Abstract:  The present work is a comment on PRL 98, 190401 (2007), arXiv:0705.0667 . The authors reported NMR measurements in solids with different pulse sequences. In some multiple $π$ pulse echo trains they observed coherent signals of several seconds, well beyond the Hahn echo decay, $T_{2HE}$ (few milliseconds). They ascribed the long tails to coherent phenomena arising on the dipolar couplings during any real finite NMR pulse. Their statement is based on some assumptions that are incorrect and parameters in the calculations, that do not represent the experimental conditions. 
0808.02765	The impact of dynamical screening on the phonon dynamics of LaCuO	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Thomas Bauer, Claus Falter	Abstract:  It is shown that dynamical screening of the Coulomb interaction in LaCuO leads to low-energy electronic collective excitations in a small region around the c-axis, strongly mixing with interlayer phonons. The manifestation of such a phonon-plasmon scenario based on a nonadiabatic charge response is quantitatively supported by a realistic calculation of the frequency and wavevector dependent irreducible polarization part of the density response function. The latter is used within linear response theory to calculate the coupled mode dispersion in the main symmetry directions of the Brillouin zone and the charge density redistributions excited by certain strongly coupling phonon-like and plasmon-like modes. Moreover, the corresponding mode induced orbital averaged changes of the selfconsistent potential felt by the electrons are assessed. Our analysis should be representative for the optimally to overdoped state of the cuprates where experimental evidence of a coherent three-dimensional Fermi surface and a coherent c-axis charge transport is given. It is demonstrated that modes from the outside of a small region around the c-axis can reliably be calculated within the adiabatic limit. Only a minor nonadiabatic correction is found for these modes in form of stiffening of the high-frequency oxygen-bond-stretching mode at the X-point which is attributed to dynamical reduced nesting. On the other hand, modes inside the nonadiabatic sector of the BZ have to be determined nonadiabatically owing to the poor dynamical screening of the long-ranged Coulomb interaction around the c-axis by the slow charge dynamics. In particular, the relevance of the strongly coupling phonon-like apex oxygen $Z$-point breathing mode at about 40 meV is emphasized whose mode energy decreases with less doping.

Furthermore, we could generalize this theorem to a much more general version and present a unified proof. 
0808.02767	Simple Formula for High-Energy Gluon Bremsstrahlung in a Finite, Expanding Medium	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Peter Arnold	Abstract:  Previous authors have considered the problem of the medium effects on single gluon bremsstrahlung associated with producing a high-energy particle in a finite, time-dependent QCD plasma. Working to leading logarithmic order, I show that the result for the bremsstrahlung gluon spectrum can be cast into a remarkably simple form in the general case. I similarly analyze the process of pair production. Also, I comment on the radius of convergence of the opacity expansion in cases where the leading-log approximation holds, showing that the opacity expansion does not converge when the thickness of the plasma is greater than roughly the bremsstrahlung formation time. Additionally, as a special bonus -- available for a limited time only while supplies last! -- I summarize translations between the notation used by a few of the groups who have worked on this and related problems.

Arzhnikov	Abstract:  The spin-spiral (SS) type of magnetization is studied with the Hubbard model. Consideration of noncollinearity of the magnetic moments results in a phase diagram which consists of regions of the SS and paramagnetic states depending on the number of electrons and the parameter U/t (U is the Hubbard repulsion, and t is an overlap integral). A possibility of stabilization of the SS state with three nonzero components of magnetic moment is considered. 
0808.02769	Saturation physics and angular correlations at RHIC and LHC	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Jamal Jalilian-Marian	Abstract:  We investigate the angular correlation between pions and photons produced in deuteron-gold collisions at RHIC and proton-lead collisions at LHC using the Color Glass Condensate formalism and make predictions for the dependence of the production cross section on the angle between the pion and photon at different rapidities and transverse momenta. Measuring this dependence would shed further light on the role of high gluon density and saturation dynamics at RHIC and LHC. 
0808.02770	Tidal Heating of Terrestrial Extra-Solar Planets and Implications for their Habitability	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Brian Jackson, Rory Barnes, Richard Greenberg	Abstract:  The tidal heating of hypothetical rocky (or terrestrial) extra-solar planets spans a wide range of values depending on stellar masses and initial orbits. Tidal heating may be sufficiently large (in many cases, in excess of radiogenic heating) and long-lived to drive plate tectonics, similar to the Earth's, which may enhance the planet's habitability. In other cases, excessive tidal heating may result in Io-like planets with violent volcanism, probably rendering them unsuitable for life. On water-rich planets, tidal heating may generate sub-surface oceans analogous to Europa's with similar prospects for habitability. Tidal heating may enhance the outgassing of volatiles, contributing to the formation and replenishment of a planet's atmosphere. To address these issues, we model the tidal heating and evolution of hypothetical extra-solar terrestrial planets. The results presented here constrain the orbital and physical properties required for planets to be habitable.

Realizing the gauge theories of interest in a setup of threebranes and fivebranes in type IIB string theory we argue for a Seiberg duality that relates Chern-Simons theories with non-trivial superpotentials. 
0808.02772	Distinct pseudogap and superconducting state quasiparticle relaxation dynamics in near-optimally doped SmFeAsO0.8F0.2 single crystals	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:T. Mertelj, V.V.Kabanov, C.Gadermaier, J.Karpinski, D. Mihailovic	Abstract:  We use femtosecond spectroscopy to investigate the quasiparticle relaxation and low-energy electronic structure in a near-optimally doped pnictide superconductor with T_c=49.5 K. Multiple relaxation processes are evident, with distinct superconducting state quasiparticle (QP) recombination dynamics exhibiting a T-dependent superconducting (SC) gap, and a clear "pseudogap" (PG) -like feature with an onset around 200K indicating the existence of a temperature-independent gap of magnitude Δ_PG= 61 +- 9 meV above T_c. Both the SC and PG components show saturation as a function of fluence with distinct saturation thresholds ~0.15 \muJ/cm^2 and 1.5 \muJ/cm^2, respectively. 
0808.02773	Seismic Activity of the Earth, the Cosmological Vectorial Potential And Method of a Short-term Earthquakes Forecasting	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:Yu. A. Baurov, Yu. A. Baurov, Yu. A. Baurov Jr., A. A. Spitalnaya, A. A. Abramyan, V. A. Solodovnikov	Abstract:  To the foundation of a principally new short-term forecasting method there has been laid down a theory of surrounding us world's creation and of physical vacuum as a result of interaction of byuons - discrete objects. The definition of the byuon contains the cosmological vector-potential A_g - a novel fundamental vector constant. This theory predicts a new anisotropic interaction of nature objects with the physical vacuum. A peculiar "tap" to gain new energy (giving rise to an earthquake) are elementary particles because their masses are proportional to the modulus of some summary potential A_sum that contains potentials of all known fields. The value of A_sum cannot be larger than the modulus of A_g. In accordance with the experimental results a new force associated with A_sum ejects substance from the area of the weakened A_sum along a conical formation with the opening of 100 +- 10 and the axis directed along the vector A_sum. This vector has the following coordinates in the second equatorial coordinate system: right ascension alpha = 293 +- 10, declination delta = 36 +- 10. Nearly 100% probability of an earthquake (earthquakes of 6 points strong and more by the Richter scale) arises when in the process of the earth rotation the zenith vector of a seismically dangerous region and/or the vectorial potential of Earth's magnetic fields are in a certain way oriented relative to the vector A_g. In the work, basic models and standard mechanisms of earthquakes are briefly considered, results of processing of information on the earthquakes in the context of global spatial anisotropy caused by the existence of the vector A_g, are presented, and an analysis of them is given. 
0808.02774	How classical is the quantum universe?	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Maurice de Gosson	Abstract:  We discuss two topics that are usually considered to be exclusively "quantum": the Schroedinger equation, and the uncertainty principle. We show (or rather recall) that the Schroedinger equation can be derived from Hamilton's equations using the metaplectic representation. We also show that the uncertainty principle, stated in the form of the Robertson-Schroedinger-Heisenberg inequalities can be formulated in perfectly classical terms using the topological notion of symplectic capacity. 
0808.02775	Parallel approximation of non-interactive zero-sum quantum games	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Rahul Jain, John Watrous	Abstract:  This paper studies a simple class of zero-sum games played by two competing quantum players: each player sends a mixed quantum state to a referee, who performs a joint measurement on the two states to determine the players' payoffs. We prove that an equilibrium point of any such game can be approximated by means of an efficient parallel algorithm, which implies that one-turn quantum refereed games, wherein the referee is specified by a quantum circuit, can be simulated in polynomial space. 
0808.02776	Phases of Higher Dimensional Black Holes	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Vasilis Niarchos	Abstract:  We review some of the most striking properties of the phase diagrams of higher dimensional black holes in pure gravity. We focus on static black hole solutions with Kaluza-Klein asymptotics and stationary black hole solutions in flat Minkowski space. Both cases exhibit a rich pattern of interconnected phases and merger points with topology changing transitions. In the first case, the phase diagram includes uniform and non-uniform black strings, localized black holes and sequences of Kaluza-Klein bubbles. In the latter case, it includes Myers-Perry black holes, black rings, black saturns and pinched black holes.

0808.02778	Trajectory end point distribution of a test particle in a turbulent liquid	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:S. F. Edwards, Moshe Schwartz	Abstract:  In a recent paper the mean square displacement (MSD), <R^2(T)>, of a particle carried by a turbulent liquid over time T has been shown to be proportional to T^6/5, meaning that the motion of the particle is slightly super-diffusive. In some cases, though, it might be important to have more information than that provided by that law. An example would be the distribution of pollutants as a function of time by turbulent flow. Here small amounts of material reaching relatively large distances are of importance. This motivates our interest in the full distribution of the location of particles swept by the fluid as a function of time. The distribution depends on the distance through the dimensionless quantity X^2=R^2/<R^2(T)> . We find that for small X, the distribution P(R,T) is proportional to exp(-aX^2) but at its tail when X is large it behaves as exp(-bX^2/3) . pacs numbers-02.50.Ey, 05.40.Fb 
0808.02779	Unifying Practical Uncertainty Representations: II. Clouds	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Sebastien Destercke, Didier Dubois, Eric Chojnacki	Abstract:  There exist many simple tools for jointly capturing variability and incomplete information by means of uncertainty representations. Among them are random sets, possibility distributions, probability intervals, and the more recent Ferson's p-boxes and Neumaier's clouds, both defined by pairs of possibility distributions. In the companion paper, we have extensively studied a generalized form of p-box and situated it with respect to other models . This paper focuses on the links between clouds and other representations. Generalized p-boxes are shown to be clouds with comonotonic distributions. In general, clouds cannot always be represented by random sets, in fact not even by 2-monotone (convex) capacities. 
0808.02780	Entropy production in temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Jean-Luc Garden (NEEL), Jacques Richard (NEEL), Yasuo Saruyama	Abstract:  The non-equilibrium process due to irreversible heat exchanges occurring during a temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry experiment is investigated in detail. This enables us to define an experimental frequency dependent complex heat capacity from this calorimetric method. The physical meaning of this dynamic heat capacity is discussed. A relationship is clearly established between the imaginary part of this complex quantity and the net entropy created during the experimental time-scale. 
0808.02781	A note on the heat kernel coefficients for nonminimal operators	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:B. Ananthanarayan	Abstract:  We consider certain results for the heat kernel of nonminimal operators. The general expressions provided by Gusynin and Kornyak resulting from symbolic computation programmes for n dimensions are evaluated for 4 dimensions which are checked against results given by Barvinsky and Vilkovisky. We also check that the results in flat space are consistent with earlier results of Guendelmen et al. We then consider a powerful construction of the Green function of a nonminimal operator by Shore for covariantly constantly gauge fields in flat spacetime, and employ dimensional arguments to produce a check on the gauge parameter dependence of a certain coefficient. The connection of the results for heat kernel coefficients emanating from the construction of Shore, to those from other techniques is hereby established for the first time. 
0808.02782	Deviations from Tri-bimaximal Mixing: Charged Lepton Corrections and Renormalization Group Running	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:S.Boudjemaa, S.F.King	Abstract:  We analyze the effects of charged lepton corrections and renormalization group (RG) running on the low energy predictions of theories which accurately predict tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing at the high energy scale. In particular we focus on GUT inspired see-saw models with accurate tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing at the GUT scale, in which the charged lepton corrections are Cabibbo-like and give rise to sum rules valid at the GUT scale. We study numerically the RG corrections to a variety of such neutrino mixing sum rules in order to assess their accuracy and reliability when comparing them to future low energy neutrino oscillation experiments. Our results indicate that the RG corrections to neutrino mixing sum rules are typically small (less than one degree), at least in the examples studied with hierarchical neutrinos. 
0808.02783	Bounds on variation of spectral subspaces under J-self-adjoint perturbations	Spectral Theory (math.SP)	Authors:S. Albeverio, A. K. Motovilov, A. A. Shkalikov	Abstract:  Let $A$ be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space $\fH$. Assume that the spectrum of $A$ consists of two disjoint components $σ_0$ and $σ_1$. Let $V$ be a bounded operator on $\fH$, off-diagonal and $J$-self-adjoint with respect to the orthogonal decomposition $\fH=\fH_0\oplus\fH_1$ where $\fH_0$ and $\fH_1$ are the spectral subspaces of $A$ associated with the spectral sets $σ_0$ and $σ_1$, respectively. We find (optimal) conditions on $V$ guaranteeing that the perturbed operator $L=A+V$ is similar to a self-adjoint operator. Moreover, we prove a number of (sharp) norm bounds on variation of the spectral subspaces of $A$ under the perturbation $V$. Some of the results obtained are reformulated in terms of the Krein space theory. As an example, the quantum harmonic oscillator under a PT-symmetric perturbation is discussed. 
0808.02784	Diffusion of wave packets in a Markov random potential	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Yang Kang, Jeffrey Schenker	Abstract:  We consider the evolution of a tight binding wave packet propagating in a time dependent potential. If the potential evolves according to a stationary Markov process, we show that the square amplitude of the wave packet converges, after diffusive rescaling, to a solution of a heat equation. 
0808.02785	Positivity and Kleiman transversality in equivariant K-theory of homogeneous spaces	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Dave Anderson, Stephen Griffeth, Ezra Miller	Abstract:  We prove the conjectures of Graham-Kumar and Griffeth-Ram concerning the alternation of signs in the structure constants for torus-equivariant K-theory of generalized flag varieties G/P. These results are immediate consequences of an equivariant homological Kleiman transversality principle for the Borel mixing spaces of homogeneous spaces, and their subvarieties, under a natural group action with finitely many orbits. The computation of the coefficients in the expansion of the equivariant K-class of a subvariety in terms of Schubert classes is reduced to an Euler characteristic using the homological transversality theorem for non-transitive group actions due to S. Sierra. A vanishing theorem, when the subvariety has rational singularities, shows that the Euler characteristic is a sum of at most one term--the top one--with a well-defined sign. The vanishing is proved by suitably modifying a geometric argument due to M. Brion in ordinary K-theory that brings Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing to bear. 
0808.02786	An interesting result concerning the lower bound to the energy in the Heisenberg picture	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Dan Solomon	Abstract:  In quantum theory it is generally assumed that there exists a special state called the vacuum state and that this state is a lower bound to the energy. However it has recently been demonstrated that this is not necessarily the case for some situations [5]. In order to clarify the situation we will consider a "very simple" field theory in the Heisenberg picture consisting of a quanitized fermion field with zero mass pariticles in 1-1D space-time interacting with a classical electrical potential. It will be shown that for this example there is no lower bound to the energy. 
0808.02787	Core Formation in Giant Gaseous Protoplanets	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ravit Helled, Gerald Schubert	Abstract:  Sedimentation rates of silicate grains in gas giant protoplanets formed by disk instability are calculated for protoplanetary masses between 1 M_Saturn to 10 M_Jupiter. Giant protoplanets with masses of 5 M_Jupiter or larger are found to be too hot for grain sedimentation to form a silicate core. Smaller protoplanets are cold enough to allow grain settling and core formation. Grain sedimentation and core formation occur in the low mass protoplanets because of their slow contraction rate and low internal temperature. It is predicted that massive giant planets will not have cores, while smaller planets will have small rocky cores whose masses depend on the planetary mass, the amount of solids within the body, and the disk environment. The protoplanets are found to be too hot to allow the existence of icy grains, and therefore the cores are predicted not to contain any ices. It is suggested that the atmospheres of low mass giant planets are depleted in refractory elements compared with the atmospheres of more massive planets. These predictions provide a test of the disk instability model of gas giant planet formation. The core masses of Jupiter and Saturn were found to be ~0.25 M_Earth and ~0.5 M_Earth, respectively. The core masses of Jupiter and Saturn can be substantially larger if planetesimal accretion is included. The final core mass will depend on planetesimal size, the time at which planetesimals are formed, and the size distribution of the material added to the protoplanet. Jupiter's core mass can vary from 2 to 12 M_Earth. Saturn's core mass is found to be ~8 M_Earth. 
0808.02788	A mid-infrared study of HII regions in the Magellanic Clouds: N88A and N160A	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:N. L. Martin-Hernandez (1), E. Peeters (2, 3 and 4), A. G. G. M. Tielens (2) ((1) IAC, (2) NASA, (3) SETI, (4) University of Western Ontario)    	Abstract:  To show the importance of high-spatial resolution observations of HII regions when compared with observations obtained with larger apertures such as ISO, we present mid-infrared spectra of two Magellanic Cloud HII regions, N88A and N160A. We obtained mid-infrared (8-13 um), long-slit spectra with TIMMI2 on the ESO 3.6m telescope. These are combined with archival spectra obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope, and are compared with the low-spatial resolution ISO-SWS data. An inventory of the spectra in terms of atomic fine-structure lines and molecular bands is presented. Concerning N88A, an isolated HII region with no adjacent infrared sources, the observations indicate that the line fluxes observed by ISO-SWS and Spitzer-IRS come exclusively from the compact HII region of about 3 arcsec in diameter. This is not the case for N160A, which has a more complex morphology. We have spectroscopically isolated for the first time the individual contributions of the three components of N160A, two high-excitation blobs, A1 and A2, and the young stellar object N160A-IR. In addition, extended [SIV] emission is observed with TIMMI2 and is most likely associated with the central star cluster located between A1 and A2. We show the value of these high-spatial resolution data in determining source characteristics, such as the degree of ionization of each high-excitation blob or the bolometric luminosity of the YSO. This luminosity is about one order of magnitude lower than previously estimated. For each high-excitation blob, we also determine the electron density and the elemental abundances of Ne, S, and Ar. 
0808.02789	Strongly t-logarithmic t-generating sets: Geometric properties of some soluble groups	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Andrew D Warshall	Abstract:  We introduce the concept of a strongly t-logarithmic t-generating set for a Z[t,t^{-1}]-module, which enables us to prove that a large class of soluble groups are not almost convex. We also prove some results about dead-end depth. 
0808.02790	On the formation and abundance of CO in AGB envelopes	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Renaud Papoular	Abstract:  It is generally considered, as a rule of thumb, that carbon monoxide forms very early in envelopes of AGB stars, and that it consumes most of the carbon, or most of the oxygen, depending on whether the photosphere is oxygen-rich or carbon-rich, respectively. \rm This work focuses on the latter case, with the purpose of quantifying the remaining fraction of gaseous carbon which is then available for forming carbonaceous grains. Since AGB stars are (probably) the main providers of cosmic carbon grains, this residual fraction is essential in establishing the validity of current grain models. Here, we use a kinetic treatment to follow the chemical evolution of circumstellar shells towards steady state. It is shown that the residual fraction depends essentially on the atomic ratio of pristine gaseous carbon and oxygen, and on the cross-section for CH formation by collision of C and H atoms. It lies between 55 and 144 C atoms per million H atoms, depending on the values adopted for unknown reaction rates and cosmic C abundance. This is much larger than predicted by the rule of thumb recalled above. The present results depend strongly on the rate of the reaction C+H-->CH: far from thermodynamic equilibrium (which is the case here), CO cannot be formed if this rate is as low as generally assumed. We have, therefore, estimated this rate by chemically modelling the reaction and found it indeed much higher, and high enough to yield CO abundances compatible with observations. An accurate experimental rate determination is highly desirable. 
0808.02791	Optical absorption from solvation-induced polarons on nanotubes	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:G.L. Ussery, Yu.N. Gartstein	Abstract:  When an excess charge carrier is added to a one-dimensional (1D) semiconductor immersed in a polar solvent, the carrier can undergo self-localization into a large-radius adiabatic polaron. We explore the local optical absorption from the ground state of 1D polarons using a simplified theoretical model for small-diameter tubular structures. It is found that about 90% of the absorption strength is contained in the transition to the second lowest-energy localized electronic level formed in the polarization potential well, with the equilibrium transition energy larger than the binding energy of the polaron. Thermal fluctuations, however, cause a very substantial -- an order of magnitude larger than the thermal energy -- broadening of the transition. The resulting broad absorption feature may serve as a signature for the optical detection of solvated charge carriers. 
0808.02792	Breuil's classification of $p$-divisible groups over regular local rings of arbitrary dimension	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Adrian Vasiu, Thomas Zink	Abstract:  Let $k$ be a perfect field of characteristic $p \geq 3$. We classify $p$-divisible groups over regular local rings of the form $W(k)[[t_1,...,t_r,u]]/(u^e+pb_{e-1}u^{e-1}+...+pb_1u+pb_0)$, where $b_0,...,b_{e-1}\in W(k)[[t_1,...,t_r]]$ and $b_0$ is an invertible element. This classification was in the case $r = 0$ conjectured by Breuil and proved by Kisin. 
0808.02793	The Weibull - log Weibull transition of interoccurrence times for synthetic and natural earthquakes	Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)	Authors:Tomohiro Hasumi, Chien-chih Chen, Takuma Akimoto, Yoji Aizawa	Abstract:  We have studied interoccurrence time distributions by analyzing the synthetic and three natural catalogs of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the Southern California Earthquake Data Center (SCEDC), and Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (TCWB) and revealed the universal feature of the interoccurrence time statistics, Weibull - log Weibull transition. This transition reinforces the view that the interoccurrence time statistics possess Weibull statistics and log-Weibull statistics. Here in this paper, the crossover magnitude from the superposition regime to the Weibull regime $m_c^2$ is proportional to the plate velocity. In addition, we have found the region-independent relation, $m_c^2/m_{max} = 0.54 \pm 0.004$. 
0808.02794	Accelerating Scientific Computations with Mixed Precision Algorithms	Mathematical Software (cs.MS)	Authors:Marc Baboulin, Alfredo Buttari, Jack Dongarra, Jakub Kurzak, Julie Langou, Julien Langou, Piotr Luszczek, Stanimire Tomov	Abstract:  On modern architectures, the performance of 32-bit operations is often at least twice as fast as the performance of 64-bit operations. By using a combination of 32-bit and 64-bit floating point arithmetic, the performance of many dense and sparse linear algebra algorithms can be significantly enhanced while maintaining the 64-bit accuracy of the resulting solution. The approach presented here can apply not only to conventional processors but also to other technologies such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), Graphical Processing Units (GPU), and the STI Cell BE processor. Results on modern processor architectures and the STI Cell BE are presented. 
0808.02795	Locally Connected HL Compacta	General Topology (math.GN)	Authors:Kenneth Kunen	Abstract:  It is consistent with MA plus not CH that there is a locally connected hereditarily Lindelof compact space which is not metrizable. 
0808.02796	Another forbidden solar oxygen abundance: the [O I] 5577 A line	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jorge Melendez (1), Martin Asplund (2) ((1) Centro de Astrofisica da Universidade de Porto (2) Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics)    	Abstract:  Context: Recent works with improved model atmospheres, line formation, atomic and molecular data, and detailed treatment of blends, have resulted in a significant downward revision of the solar oxygen abundance. Aims: Considering the importance of the Sun as an astrophysical standard and the current conflict of standard solar models using the new solar abundances with helioseismological observations we have performed a new study of the solar oxygen abundance based on the forbidden [OI] line at 5577.34 A, not previously considered. Methods: High-resolution (R > 500 000), high signal-to-noise (S/N > 1000) solar spectra of the [O I] 5577.34 A line have been analyzed employing both three-dimensional (3D) and a variety of 1D (spatially and temporally averaged 3D, Holweger & Muller, MARCS and Kurucz models with and without convective overshooting) model atmospheres. Results: The oxygen abundance obtained from the [OI] 5577.3 A forbidden line is almost insensitive to the input model atmosphere and has a mean value of A(O) = 8.71 +/- 0.02 (σfrom using the different model atmospheres). The total error (0.07 dex) is dominated by uncertainties in the log gf value (0.03 dex), apparent line variation (0.04 dex) and uncertainties in the continuum and line positions (0.05 dex). Conclusions: The here derived oxygen abundance is close to the 3D-based estimates from the two other [OI] lines at 6300 and 6363 A, the permitted OI lines and vibrational and rotational OH transitions in the infrared. Our study thus supports a low solar oxygen abundance (A(O) ~ 8.7), independent of the adopted model atmosphere. 
0808.02797	A remark on Khovanov homology and two-fold branched covers	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Liam Watson	Abstract:  Examples of knots and links distinguished by the total rank of their Khovanov homology but sharing the same two-fold branched cover are given. As a result, Khovanov homology does not yield an invariant of two-fold branched covers. 
0808.02798	On satellites in semi-abelian categories: Homology without projectives	Algebraic Topology (math.AT)	Authors:Julia Goedecke, Tim Van der Linden	Abstract:  Working in a semi-abelian context, we use Janelidze's theory of generalised satellites to study universal properties of the Everaert long exact homology sequence. This results in a new definition of homology which does not depend on the existence of projective objects. We explore the relations with other notions of homology, and thus prove a version of the higher Hopf formulae. We also work out some examples. 
0808.02799	Curvature structure of self-dual 4-manifolds	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Novica Blazic, Peter Gilkey, Stana Nikcevic, Iva Stavrov	Abstract:  We show the existence of a modified Cliff(1,1) structure compatible with an Osserman 0-model of signature (2,2). We then apply this algebraic result to certain classes of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of signature (2,2). We obtain a new characterization of the Weyl curvature tensor of an (anti-)self-dual manifold and we prove some new results regarding (Jordan) Osserman manifolds. 
0808.02800	Search for photon oscillations into massive particles	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Mathilde Fouché (LCAR), Cécile Robilliard (LCAR), Stéphane Faure (LCAR), Carlo Rizzo (LCAR), Julien Mauchain (LNCMP), Marc Nardone (LNCMP), Remy Battesti (LNCMP), Luc Martin (LULI), Anne-Marie Sautivet (LULI), Jean-Luc Paillard (LULI), François Amiranoff (LULI)    	Abstract:  In this paper, we present the final results of our experiment on photon-axion oscillations in the presence of a magnetic field, which took place at LULI (Laboratoire pour l'Utilisation des Lasers Intenses, Palaiseau, France). Our null measurement allowed us to exclude the existence of axions with inverse coupling constant $M>9.\times 10^5$ GeV for low axion masses and to improve the preceding BFRT limits by a factor 3 or more for axion masses $1.1 {meV} <m_a<2.6 {meV}$. We also show that our experimental results improve the existing limits on the parameters of a low mass hidden-sector boson usually dubbed "paraphoton" because of its similarity with the usual photon. 
0808.02801	Discretized Multinomial Distributions and Nash Equilibria in Anonymous Games	Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)	Authors:Constantinos Daskalakis, Christos H. Papadimitriou	Abstract:  We show that there is a polynomial-time approximation scheme for computing Nash equilibria in anonymous games with any fixed number of strategies (a very broad and important class of games), extending the two-strategy result of Daskalakis and Papadimitriou 2007. The approximation guarantee follows from a probabilistic result of more general interest: The distribution of the sum of n independent unit vectors with values ranging over {e1, e2, ...,ek}, where ei is the unit vector along dimension i of the k-dimensional Euclidean space, can be approximated by the distribution of the sum of another set of independent unit vectors whose probabilities of obtaining each value are multiples of 1/z for some integer z, and so that the variational distance of the two distributions is at most eps, where eps is bounded by an inverse polynomial in z and a function of k, but with no dependence on n. Our probabilistic result specifies the construction of a surprisingly sparse eps-cover -- under the total variation distance -- of the set of distributions of sums of independent unit vectors, which is of interest on its own right. 
0808.02802	Electro-optic and electrical properties in Hafnium-doped congruent lithium-niobate crystals	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Mustapha Abarkan (LMOPS), Michel Aillerie (LMOPS), Jean-Paul Salvestrini (LMOPS), Marc D. Fontana (LMOPS), Edvard Kokanyan	Abstract:  We report the optical and dielectric properties in hafnium (Hf)-doped lithium niobate (LN) crystals. We investigated samples of congruent composition with various doping concentration varying from 0 to 8 mol%. The clamped and unclamped values of the electro-optic coefficient r 22 of Hf-doped LN and the corresponding dielectric permittivity as well, have been experimentally determined and compared with the results obtained in undoped congruent LN crystals. We show that the electro-optic and dielectric properties are only slightly affected by the introduction of hafnium ions, and therefore Hf-doped LN has the advantage of low photorefractive damage compared with the undoped congruent LN.

0808.02804	A New Assumed Interaction. Experiments and Manifestations in Astrophysics	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:Yu A. Baurov	Abstract:  Results of experimental investigations of a new assumed interaction in nature with the aid of high-current magnets, torsion and piezoresonance balances, high-precision gravimeter, fluctuations in intensity of betta-decay of radioactive elements, plasma devices and manifestations in astrophysics are presented. A possible explanation of the results obtained based on a hypothesis of global anisotropy of physical space caused by the existence of a cosmological vectorial potential A_g, is given. It is shown that the vector A_g has the following coordinates in the second equatorial coordinate system: right ascension alpha = 293 +- 10, declination delta = 36 +- 10. 
0808.02805	Inverse resonance scattering for Jacobi operators	Spectral Theory (math.SP)	Authors:Evgeny Korotyaev	Abstract:  We consider the Jacobi operator $(Jf)_n= a_{n-1}f_{n-1}+a_nf_{n+1}+b_nf_n$ on $\Z$ with a real compactly supported sequences $(a_n-1)_{n\in\Z}$ and $(b_n)_{n\in\Z}$. We give the solution of two inverse problems (including characterization): $ (a,b)\to \{$zeros of the reflection coefficient$\}$ and $(a,b)\to \{$bound states and resonances$\}$. We describe the set of "iso-resonance operators $J$", i.e., all operators $J$ with the same resonances and bound states. 
0808.02806	Planar wallpaper group metamaterial for novel terahertz applications	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Christopher M. Bingham, Hu Tao, Xianliang Liu, Richard D. Averitt, Xin Zhang, Willie J. Padilla	Abstract:  We present novel metamaterial structures based upon various planar wallpaper groups, in both hexagonal and square unit cells. An investigation of metamaterials consisting of one, two, and three unique sub-lattices with resonant frequencies in the terahertz (THz) was performed. We describe the theory, and perform simulations and experiments to characterize these multiple element metamaterials. A method for using these new structures as a means for bio / chemical hazard detection, as well as electromagnetic signature control is proposed. 
0808.02807	High energy neutrinos from charm in astrophysical sources	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Rikard Enberg (Arizona), Mary Hall Reno (Iowa), Ina Sarcevic (Arizona)    	Abstract:  Charm production gives rise to a flux of very high energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources with jets driven by central engines, such as gamma ray bursts or supernovae with jets. The neutrino flux from semi-leptonic decays of charmed mesons is subject to much less hadronic and radiative cooling than the conventional flux from pion and kaon decays and therefore has a dominant contribution at higher energies, of relevance to future ultrahigh energy neutrino experiments. 
0808.02808	New spherically symmetric solutions in Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs model	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Junji Jia	Abstract:  We study classical solutions in the SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. The spherically symmetric ansätze for all fields are given and the equations of motion are derived as a system of ordinary differential equations. The asymptotics and the boundary conditions at space origin for regular solutions and at event horizon for black hole solutions are studied. Using the shooting method, we found numerical solutions to the theory. For regular solutions, we find two new sets of asymptotically flat solutions. Each of these sets contains continua of solutions in the parameter space spanned by the shooting parameters. The solutions bifurcate along these parameter curves and the bifurcation are argued to be due to the internal structure of the model. Both sets of the solutions are asymptotically flat but one is exponentially so and the other is so with oscillations. For black holes, a new set of boundary conditions is studied and it is found that there also exists a continuum of black hole solutions in parameter space and similar bifurcation behavior is also present to these solutions. The SU(2) charges of these solutions are found zero and these solutions are proven to be unstable. 
0808.02809	Monte Carlo Study of an Inhomogeneous Blume-Capel Model	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:S.M. Pittman, G.G. Batrouni, R.T. Scalettar	Abstract:  Systems of particles in a confining potential exhibit a spatially dependent density which fundamentally alters the nature of phase transitions that occur. A specific instance of this situation, which is being extensively explored currently, concerns the properties of ultra-cold, optically trapped atoms. Of interest is how the superfluid-insulator transition is modified by the inhomogeneity, and, indeed, the extent to which a sharp transition survives at all. This paper explores a classical analog of these systems, the Blume-Capel model with a spatially varying single ion anisotropy and/or temperature gradient. We present results both for the nature of the critical properties and for the validity of the "local density approximation" which is often used to model the inhomogeneous case. We compare situations when the underlying uniform transition is first and second order. 
0808.02810	Constraining the Surface Inhomogeneity and Settling Times of Metals on Accreting White Dwarfs	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. H. Montgomery (1,3), S. E. Thompson (2,3), T. von Hippel (1,4) ((1) Univ. of Texas, (2) Univ. of Delaware, (3) Delaware Asteroseismic Research Center, (4) Siena College)    	Abstract:  Due to the short settling times of metals in DA white dwarf atmospheres, any white dwarfs with photospheric metals must be actively accreting. It is therefore natural to expect that the metals may not be deposited uniformly on the surface of the star. We present calculations showing how the temperature variations associated with white dwarf pulsations lead to an observable diagnostic of the surface metal distribution, and we show what constraints current data sets are able to provide. We also investigate the effect that time-variable accretion has on the metal abundances of different species, and we show how this can lead to constraints on the gravitational settling times. 
0808.02811	Holographic Systematics of D-brane Inflation	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Daniel Baumann, Anatoly Dymarsky, Shamit Kachru, Igor R. Klebanov, Liam McAllister	Abstract:  We provide a systematic treatment of possible corrections to the inflaton potential for D-brane inflation in the warped deformed conifold. We consider the D3-brane potential in the presence of the most general possible corrections to the throat geometry sourced by coupling to the bulk of a compact Calabi-Yau space. This corresponds to the potential on the Coulomb branch of the dual gauge theory, in the presence of arbitrary perturbations of the Lagrangian. The leading contributions arise from perturbations by the most relevant operators that do not destroy the throat geometry. We find a generic contribution from a non-chiral operator of dimension $Δ=2$ associated with a global symmetry current, resulting in a negative contribution to the inflaton mass-squared. If the Calabi-Yau preserves certain discrete symmetries, this is the dominant correction to the inflaton potential, and fine-tuning of the inflaton mass is possible. In the absence of such discrete symmetries, the dominant contribution comes from a chiral operator with $Δ=3/2$, corresponding to a $φ^{3/2}$ term in the inflaton potential. The resulting inflationary models are phenomenologically similar to the inflection point scenarios arising from specific D7-brane embeddings, but occur under far more general circumstances. Our strategy extends immediately to other warped geometries, given sufficient knowledge of the Kaluza-Klein spectrum. 
0808.02812	Discovery of the Ultra-Bright Type II-L Supernova 2008es	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Gezari, J. P. Halpern, D. Grupe, F. Yuan, R. Quimby, T. McKay, D. Chamarro, M. D. Sisson, C. Akerlof, J. C. Wheeler, P. J. Brown, S. B. Cenko, A. Rau, J. O. Djordjevic, D. M. Terndrup	Abstract:  We report the discovery by the Robotic Optical Transient Experiment (ROTSE-IIIb) telescope of SN 2008es, an overluminous supernova (SN) at z=0.205 with a peak visual magnitude of -22.2. We present multiwavelength follow-up observations with the Swift satellite and several ground-based optical telescopes. The ROTSE-IIIb observations constrain the time of explosion to be 23+/-1 rest-frame days before maximum. The linear decay of the optical light curve, and the combination of a symmetric, broad Hαemission line profile with broad P Cygni Hβand Na I \lambda5892 profiles, are properties reminiscent of the bright Type II-L SNe 1979C and 1980K, although SN 2008es is greater than 10 times more luminous. The host galaxy is undetected in pre-supernova Sloan Digital Sky Survey images, and similar to Type II-L SN 2005ap (the most luminous SN ever observed), the host is most likely a dwarf galaxy with M_r > -17. Swift Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope observations in combination with Palomar photometry measure the SED of the SN from 200 to 800 nm to be a blackbody that cools from a temperature of 14,000 K at the time of the optical peak to 6400 K 65 days later. The inferred blackbody radius is in good agreement with the radius expected for the expansion speed measured from the broad lines (10,000 km/s). The bolometric luminosity at the optical peak is 2.8 x 10^44 erg/s, with a total energy radiated over the next 65 days of 5.6 x 10^50 erg. We favor a model in which the exceptional peak luminosity is a consequence of the core-collapse explosion of a progenitor star with a low-mass extended hydrogen envelope and a stellar wind with a density close to the upper limit on the mass-loss rate measured from the lack of an X-ray detection by the Swift X-Ray Telescope. (Abridged). 
0808.02813	Is there an upper limit to black hole masses?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Priyamvada Natarajan, Ezequiel Treister	Abstract:  We make a case for the existence for ultra-massive black holes (UMBHs) in the Universe, but argue that there exists a likely upper limit to black hole masses of the order of $M \sim 10^{10} \msun$. We show that there are three strong lines of argument that predicate the existence of UMBHs: (i) expected as a natural extension of the observed black hole mass bulge luminosity relation, when extrapolated to the bulge luminosities of bright central galaxies in clusters; (ii) new predictions for the mass function of seed black holes at high redshifts predict that growth via accretion or merger-induced accretion inevitably leads to the existence of rare UMBHs at late times; (iii) the local mass function of black holes computed from the observed X-ray luminosity functions of active galactic nuclei predict the existence of a high mass tail in the black hole mass function at $z = 0$. Consistency between the optical and X-ray census of the local black hole mass function requires an upper limit to black hole masses. This consistent picture also predicts that the slope of the $M_{\rm bh}$-$σ$ relation will evolve with redshift at the high mass end. Models of self-regulation that explain the co-evolution of the stellar component and nuclear black holes naturally provide such an upper limit. The combination of multi-wavelength constraints predicts the existence of UMBHs and simultaneously provides an upper limit to their masses. The typical hosts for these local UMBHs are likely the bright, central cluster galaxies in the nearby Universe. 
0808.02814	Top quark induced vacuum misalignment in little higgs models	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Benjamin Grinstein, Michael Trott	Abstract:  We show that the effect of the top quark can dominate over the effect of the gauge sector in determining the vacuum alignment in little higgs (LH) models. We demonstrate that in the littlest LH model and the SU(2)xSU(2)xU(1) LH model, ensuring that the correct vacuum alignment is chosen requires that a subset of the gauge sector couplings be large to overcome the effect of the top quark. We quantify this effect by deriving bounds on the couplings in the gauge sector and demonstrate that these bounds provide a compelling theoretical reason for the gauge coupling constant hierarchy in the SU(2)xSU(2)xU(1) model that reduces the Goldstone decay constant scale to a TeV. We also argue that for a class of LH models with T parity the top quark drives the correct vacuum alignment and therefore all gauge couplings can be small. 
0808.02815	Tracing high density gas in M 82 and NGC 4038	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:E. Bayet, C. Lintott, S. Viti, J. Martín-Pintado, S. Martín, D.A. Williams, J.M.C. Rawlings	Abstract:  We present the first detection of CS in the Antennae galaxies towards the NGC 4038 nucleus, as well as the first detections of two high-J (5-4 and 7-6) CS lines in the center of M 82. The CS(7-6) line in M 82 shows a profile that is surprisingly different to those of other low-J CS transitions we observed. This implies the presence of a separate, denser and warmer molecular gas component. The derived physical properties and the likely location of the CS(7-6) emission suggests an association with the supershell in the centre of M 82. 
0808.02816	The nature of faint Spitzer-selected dust-obscured galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Alexandra Pope (1), R. Shane Bussmann (2), Arjun Dey (1), Nicole Meger (3), David M. Alexander (4), Mark Brodwin (1), Ranga-Ram Chary (5), Mark E. Dickinson (1), David T. Frayer (6), Thomas R. Greve (7), Minh Huynh (6), Lihwai Lin (8), Glenn Morrison (9, 10), Douglas Scott (3), Chi-Hung Yan (8, 11) ((1) NOAO, (2) Steward, (3) UBC, (4) Durham, (5) SSC, (6)IPAC, (7) Heidelberg, (8) ASIAA, (9) IfA HI, (10) CFHT, (11) NTNU)    	Abstract:  We use deep far-IR, submm, radio and X-ray imaging and mid-IR spectroscopy to explore the nature of a sample of Spitzer-selected dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) in GOODS-N. A sample of 79 galaxies satisfy the criteria R-[24]>14 (Vega) down to S24>100 microJy. Twelve of these galaxies have IRS spectra available which we use to measure redshifts and classify these objects as being dominated by star formation or active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity in the mid-IR. The IRS spectra and Spitzer photometric redshifts confirm that the DOGs lie in a tight redshift distribution around z~2. Based on mid-IR colors, 80% of DOGs are likely dominated by star formation; the stacked X-ray emission from this sub-sample of DOGs is also consistent with star formation. Since only a small number of DOGs are individually detected at far-IR and submm wavelengths, we use a stacking analysis to determine the average flux from these objects and plot a composite IR (8-1000 microns) spectral energy distribution (SED). The average luminosity of these star forming DOGs is LIR~1e12 Lsun. We compare the average star forming DOG to the average bright (S850>5 mJy) submillimeter galaxy (SMG); the S24>100 microJy DOGs are 3 times more numerous but 8 times less luminous in the IR. The far-IR SED shape of DOGs is similar to that of SMGs (average dust temperature of around 30 K) but DOGs have a higher mid-IR to far-IR flux ratio. The average star formation-dominated DOG has a star formation rate of 200 Msun/yr which, given their space density, amounts to a contribution of 0.01 Msun/yr/Mpc3 (or 5-10%) to the star formation rate density at z~2. We use the composite SED to predict the average flux of DOGs in future Herschel/PACS 100 micron and SCUBA-2 450 micron surveys and show that the majority of them will be detected. 
0808.02817	Notes on the Heegaard-Floer Link Surgery Spectral Sequence	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Lawrence Roberts	Abstract:  This largely technical paper is divided into two parts: part I: An account of P. Ozsvath and Z. Szabo's construction of the link surgery spectral sequence. There are no new results here, but this part slightly modifies and expands their proof and is included as an aid to part II. part II: Some modifications of the spectral sequence suitable for knot Floer homology; an exposition of the invariance of the spectral sequence, under a suitable equivalence, from alterations of the underlying bouquet; and an account of the morphisms induced on the spectral sequences by suitable four dimensional cobordisms and how they depend upon the four manifold. This is the author's effort to investigate a question at the end of the introduction to P. Ozsvath's and Z. Szabo's paper "On the Heegaard-Floer homology of double branched covers." 
0808.02818	A Bitter Pill: The Primordial Lithium Problem Worsens	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Richard H. Cyburt, Brian D. Fields, Keith A. Olive	Abstract:  The lithium problem arises from the significant discrepancy between the primordial 7Li abundance as predicted by BBN theory and the WMAP baryon density, and the pre-Galactic lithium abundance inferred from observations of metal-poor (Population II) stars. This problem has loomed for the past decade, with a persistent discrepancy of a factor of 2--3 in 7Li/H. Recent developments have sharpened all aspects of the Li problem. Namely: (1) BBN theory predictions have sharpened due to new nuclear data, particularly the uncertainty on 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be, has reduced to 7.4%, and with a central value shift of ~ +0.04 keV barn. (2) The WMAP 5-year data now yields a cosmic baryon density with an uncertainty reduced to 2.7%. (3) Observations of metal-poor stars have tested for systematic effects, and have reaped new lithium isotopic data. With these, we now find that the BBN+WMAP predicts 7Li/H = (5.24+0.71-0.67) 10^{-10}. The Li problem remains and indeed is exacerbated; the discrepancy is now a factor 2.4--4.3 or 4.2sigma (from globular cluster stars) to 5.3sigma (from halo field stars). Possible resolutions to the lithium problem are briefly reviewed, and key nuclear, particle, and astronomical measurements highlighted. 
0808.02819	Nanoscale freezing of the 2D spin liquid Pr$_{3}$Ga$_{5}$SiO$_{14}$	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:H. D. Zhou, C. R. Wiebe, L. Balicas, Y.-J. Jo, Y. Takano, M. J. Case, Y. Qiu, J. R. D. Copley, J. S. Gardner	Abstract:  In this letter, we report on the single crystal growth and physical characterization of the distorted kagomé system Pr$_3$Ga$_5$SiO$_{14}$. It is found that at zero magnetic field the system shows no magnetic order down to 0.035 K and exhibits a $T^{2}$ behavior for the specific heat at low temperatures, indicative of a gapless 2D spin liquid state. Application of an applied field induces nanoscale islands of ordered spins, with a concomitant reduction of the $T^{2}$ specific heat term. This state could be a possible ferro-spin nematic ordering stabilized out of an unusual spin liquid state. 
0808.02820	Gravitinos Tunneling from Black Holes	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Alexandre Yale, Robert B. Mann	Abstract:  Black hole radiation of gravitinos is investigated as the classically forbidden tunneling of spin-3/2 fermions through an event horizon. We show that all four spin states of the gravitino yield the same emission temperature, and retrieve the Unruh temperature in a Rindler spacetime as well as the Hawking temperature for a Kerr-Newman charged rotating black hole. 
0808.02821	Micromagic clock: microwave clock based on atoms in an engineered optical lattice	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:K. Beloy, A. Derevianko, V. A. Dzuba, V. V. Flambaum	Abstract:  We propose a new class of atomic microwave clocks based on the hyperfine transitions in the ground state of aluminum or gallium atoms trapped in optical lattices. For these elements magic wavelengths exist at which both levels of the hyperfine doublet are shifted at the same rate by the lattice laser field, cancelling its effect on the clock transition. Our analysis of various systematic effects shows that, while offering an improved control over systematic errors, the accuracy of the proposed microwave clock is competitive to that of the state-of-the-art primary frequency standard. 
0808.02822	More bijective Catalan combinatorics on permutations and on signed permutations	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Christian Stump	Abstract:  In this paper, we construct bijections between Dyck paths, noncrossing partitions, and 231-avoiding permutations, which send the area statistic on Dyck paths to the inversion number on noncrossing partitions and on 231-avoiding permutations. This bijection has the additional property that it simultaneously sends the major index on Dyck paths to the sum of the major index and the inverse major index on noncrossing partitions and on 231-avoiding permutations, respectively. Moreover, we provide generalizations of these constructions to the group of signed permutations. 
0808.02823	Planet-bound dark matter and the internal heat of Uranus, Neptune, and hot-Jupiter exoplanets	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Stephen L. Adler	Abstract:  We suggest that accretion of planet-bound dark matter by the Jovian planets, and by hot-Jupiter exoplanets, could be a significant source of their internal heat. The anomalously low internal heat of Uranus would then be explained if the collision believed to have tilted the axis of Uranus also knocked it free of most of its associated dark matter cloud. Our considerations focus on the efficient capture of non-self-annihilating dark matter, but could also apply to self-annihilating dark matter, provided the capture efficiency is small enough that the earth heat balance constraint is obeyed. 
0808.02824	HAWK-I imaging of the X-ray luminous galaxy cluster XMMU J2235.3-2557: The red sequence at z=1.39	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:C. Lidman, P. Rosati, M. Tanaka, V. Strazzullo, R. Demarco, C. Mullis, N. Ageorges, M. Kissler-Patig, M. G. Petr-Gotzens, F. Selman	Abstract:  We use HAWK-I, the recently-commissioned near-IR imager on Yepun (VLT-UT4), to obtain wide-field, high-resolution images of the X-ray luminous galaxy cluster XMMU J2235.3-2557 in the J and Ks bands, and we use these images to build a colour-magnitude diagram of cluster galaxies. Galaxies in the core of the cluster form a tight red sequence with a mean J-Ks colour of 1.9 (Vega system). The intrinsic scatter in the colour of galaxies that lie on the red sequence is similar to that measured for galaxies on the red sequence of the Coma cluster. The slope and location of the red sequence can be modelled by passively evolving the red sequence of the Coma cluster backwards in time. Using simple stellar population (SSP) models, we find that galaxies in the core of XMMU J2235.3-2557 are, even at z=1.39, already 3 Gyr old, corresponding to a formation redshift of z ~ 4. Outside the core, the intrinsic scatter and the fraction of galaxies actively forming stars increase substantially. Using SSP models, we find that most of these galaxies will join the red sequence within 1.5 Gyr. The contrast between galaxies in the cluster core and galaxies in the cluster outskirts indicates that the red sequence of XMMU J2235.3-2557 is being built from the dense cluster core outwards. 
0808.02825	Physics of the light quarks	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:H. Leutwyler	Abstract:  These lecture notes concern recent developments in our understanding of the low energy properties of QCD. Significant progress has been made on the lattice and the beautiful experimental results on the Ke4 and K->3pi decays, as well as those on pionic atoms also confirm the results obtained on the basis of Chiral Perturbation Theory. There is an exception: one of the precision experiments on Kmu3 decay is in flat contradiction with the Callan-Treiman relation. If confirmed, this would indicate physics beyond the Standard Model: right-handed quark couplings of the W-boson, for instance. Furthermore, I discuss two examples where the estimates of the effective coupling constants based on saturation by resonances appear to fail. In the second part, the progress made in extending the range of validity of the effective theory with dispersive methods is reviewed. In particular, I draw attention to an exact formula, which expresses the mass and width of a resonance in terms of observable quantities. The formula removes the ambiguities inherent in the analytic continuation from the real axis into the complex plane, which plagued previous determinations of the pole positions associated with broad resonances. In particular, it can now be demonstrated that the lowest resonance of QCD carries the quantum numbers of the vacuum. 
0808.02826	Crystal Growth and Anisotropic Magnetic Properties of RAg$_2$Ge$_2$ (R = Pr, Nd and Sm) Single Crystals	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Devang A. Joshi, R. Nagalakshmi, R. Kulkarni, S. K. Dhar, A. Thamizhavel	Abstract:  We report the single crystal growth and anisotropic magnetic properties of the tetragonal RAg$_2$Ge$_2$ (R = Pr, Nd and Sm) compounds which crystallize in the ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ type crystal structure with the space group \textit{I4/mmm}. The single crystals of RAg$_2$Ge$_2$ (R = Pr, Nd and Sm) were grown by self-flux method using Ag:Ge binary alloy as flux. From the magnetic studies on single crystalline samples we have found that PrAg$_2$Ge$_2$ and NdAg$_2$Ge$_2$ order antiferromagnetically at 12 K and 2 K respectively, thus corroborating the earlier polycrystalline results. SmAg$_2$Ge$_2$ also orders antiferromagnetically at 9.2 K. The magnetic susceptibility and magnetization show a large anisotropy and the easy axis of magnetization for PrAg$_2$Ge$_2$ and NdAg$_2$Ge$_2$ is along the [100] direction where as it changes to [001] direction for SmAg$_2$Ge$_2$. Two metamagnetic transitions were observed in NdAg$_2$Ge$_2$ at $H_{\rm m1}$ = 1.25 T and $H_{\rm m2}$ =3.56 T for the field parallel to [100] direction where as the magnetization along [001] direction was linear indicating the hard axis of magnetization. 
0808.02827	Fast Intrinsic Mode Decomposition and Filtering of Time Series Data	Numerical Analysis (cs.NA)	Authors:Louis Yu Lu	Abstract:  The intrinsic mode function (IMF) provides adaptive function bases for nonlinear and non-stationary time series data. A fast convergent iterative method is introduced in this paper to find the IMF components of the data, the method is faster and more predictable than the Empirical Mode Decomposition method devised by the author of Hilbert Huang Transform. The approach is to iteratively adjust the control points on the data function corresponding to the extrema of the refining IMF, the control points of the residue function are calculated as the median of the straight line segments passing through the data control points, the residue function is then constructed as the cubic spline function of the median points. The initial residue function is simply constructed as the straight line segments passing through the extrema of the first derivative of the data function. The refining IMF is the difference between the data function and the improved residue function. The IMF found reveals all the riding waves in the whole data set. A new data filtering method on frequency and amplitude of IMF is also presented with the similar approach of finding the residue on the part to be filtered out. The program to demonstrate the method is distributed under BSD open source license. 
0808.02828	Impact of the Meissner effect on magnetic micro traps for neutral atoms near superconducting thin films	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:D. Cano, B. Kasch, H. Hattermann, D. Koelle, R. Kleiner, C. Zimmermann, J. Fortágh	Abstract:  We theoretically evaluate changes in the magnetic potential arising from the magnetic field near superconducting thin films. An example of an atom chip based on a three-wire configuration has been simulated in the superconducting and the normal conducting state. Inhomogeneous current densities within the superconducting wires were calculated using an energy-minimization routine based on the London theory. The Meissner effect causes changes to both trap position and oscillation frequencies at short distances from the superconducting surface. Superconducting wires produce much shallower micro traps than normal conducting wires. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the importance of taking the Meissner effect into account when designing and carrying out experiments on magnetically trapped neutral atoms near superconducting surfaces. 
0808.02829	Optimal fidelity of teleportation of coherent states and entanglement	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Andrea Mari, David Vitali	Abstract:  We study the Braunstein-Kimble protocol for the continuous variable teleportation of a coherent state. We determine lower and upper bounds for the optimal fidelity of teleportation, maximized over all local Gaussian operations for a given entanglement of the two-mode Gaussian state shared by the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob). We also determine the optimal local transformations at Alice and Bob sites and the corresponding maximum fidelity when one restricts to local trace-preserving Gaussian completely positive maps. 
0808.02830	Tachyonic Universes in Patch Cosmologies with $Ω>1$	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Sergio del Campo, Ramon Herrera, Pedro Labrana, Carlos Leiva, Joel Saavedra	Abstract:  In this article we study closed inflationary universe models by means of a tachyonic field. We described a general treatment for created a universe with $Ω>1$ in patch cosmology, which is able to represent General Relativity, Gauss-Bonnet or Randall-Sundrum patches. We use recent data from astronomical observations to constrain the parameters appearing in our model. 
0808.02831	Projective Connections and the Algebra of Densities	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Jacob George	Abstract:  Projective connections first appeared in Cartan's papers in the 1920's. Since then they have resurfaced periodically in, for example, integrable systems and perhaps most recently in the context of so called projectively equivariant quantisation. We recall the notion of projective connection and describe its relation with the algebra of densities on a manifold. In particular, we construct a Laplace-type operator on functions using a Thomas projective connection and a symmetric contravariant tensor of rank 2 (`upper metric'). 
0808.02832	Cooperative response of Pb(ZrTi)O$_3$ nanoparticles to curled electric fields	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Ivan I. Naumov, Huaxiang Fu	Abstract:  Using first-principles based effective Hamiltonian and finite temperature Monte Carlo simulations we investigate cooperative responses, as well as microscopic mechanism for vortex switching, in zero-dimensional Pb(Zr$_{0.5}$Ti$_{0.5}$)O$_3$ nanoparticles under curled electric fields. We find that the generally accepted domain coexistence mechanism is not valid for toroid switching. Instead dipoles are shown to display unusual collective behaviors by forming a new vortex with perpendicular (but not opposite) toroid moment. The strong correlation between the new and original vortices is revealed to be critical for reversing toroid moment. Microscopic insight for the puzzling collective response is discussed. Based on our finding, we further describe a technological approach that is able to drastically reduce the magnitude of the curled electric field needed for vortex switching. 
0808.02833	Efficient tests for equivalence of hidden Markov processes and quantum random walks	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Ulrich Faigle, Alexander Schönhuth	Abstract:  While two hidden Markov process (HMP) resp. quantum random walk (QRW) parametrizations can differ from one another, the stochastic processes arising from them can be equivalent. Here a polynomial-time algorithm is presented which can determine equivalence of two HMP parametrizations $\cM_1,\cM_2$ resp. two QRW parametrizations $\cQ_1,\cQ_2$ in time $O(|§|\max(N_1,N_2)^{4})$, where $N_1,N_2$ are the number of hidden states in $\cM_1,\cM_2$ resp. the dimension of the state spaces associated with $\cQ_1,\cQ_2$, and $§$ is the set of output symbols. Previously available algorithms for testing equivalence of HMPs were exponential in the number of hidden states. In case of QRWs, algorithms for testing equivalence had not yet been presented. The core subroutines of this algorithm can also be used to efficiently test hidden Markov processes and quantum random walks for ergodicity. 
0808.02834	The Darboux process and a noncommutative bispectral problem	Spectral Theory (math.SP)	Authors:F. Alberto Grünbaum	Abstract:  The Darboux process, also known by many other names, played a very important role in some extremely enjoyable joint work that Hans and I did 25 years ago. I revisit a version of this problem in a case when scalars are replaced by matrices, i.e., elements of a non-commutative ring. Many of the issues studied here can be pushed to the case of a ring with identity, but my emphasis is on very concrete examples involving $2 \times 2$ matrices. 
0808.02835	Giant Magnetocaloric Effect in Re-entrant Ferromagnet PrMn1.4Fe0.6Ge2	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:R. Zeng, J. L Wang, L. Lu, W.X. Li, S.J. Campbell, S. X. Dou	Abstract:  Three first order magnetic phase transitions (FOMT) have been detected at TCPr, TNinter and TCinter over the temperature range from 5 K to 340 K at fields up to 9 T in PrMn1.4Fe0.6Ge2, and the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) around these transitions evaluated. The MCE of two FOMT from planar antiferromagnetism (AFl) to c-axis ferromagnetism (Fmc) around 168 K, and from the Fmc state to the c-axis AFmc state around 157 K have acceptable values compared with those of existing MCE systems. A giant magnetocaloric effect (GMCE) has been observed around 25.5 K associated with the field-induced FOMT from the AFmc to the Fmc+F(Pr) state with an additional Pr magnetic contribution. The MCE value 29.1 J/kg K with field change 7 T is comparable to and even larger than reported values for the best-performed MCE materials. In particular, the giant MCE value of 12.3 J/kg K obtained for the relatively small field change from 0 to 1 T is very beneficial for applications, and this, together with the small magnetic and thermal hysteresis, suggests that PrMn1.4Fe0.6Ge2 may be a promising candidate for magnetic refrigeration applications in the hydrogen liquefication temperature range. 
0808.02836	High energy spin excitations in BaFe2As2	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:R.A. Ewings, T.G. Perring, R.I. Bewley, T. Guidi, M.J. Pitcher, D.R. Parker, S.J. Clarke, A.T. Boothroyd	Abstract:  We report neutron scattering measurements of cooperative spin excitations in antiferromagnetically ordered BaFe2As2, the parent phase of an iron pnictide superconductor. The data extend up to ~100meV and show that the spin excitation spectrum is sharp and highly dispersive. By fitting the spectrum to a linear spin-wave model we estimate the magnon bandwidth to be in the region of 0.17eV. The large characteristic spin fluctuation energy suggests that magnetism could play a role in the formation of the superconducting state. 
0808.02837	List Decoding of Burst Errors	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Ron M. Roth, Pascal O. Vontobel	Abstract:  A generalization of the Reiger bound is presented for the list decoding of burst errors. It is then shown that Reed-Solomon codes attain this bound. 
0808.02838	Analysis of MDI High-Degree Mode Frequencies and their Rotational Splittings	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M.C. Rabello-Soares, S.G. Korzennik, J. Schou	Abstract:  Here we present a detailed analysis of solar acoustic mode frequencies and their rotational splittings for modes with degree up to 900. They were obtained by applying spherical harmonic decomposition to full-disk solar images observed by the Michelson Doppler Imager onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory spacecraft. Global helioseismology analysis of high-degree modes is complicated by the fact that the individual modes cannot be isolated, which has limited so far the use of high-degree data for structure inversion of the near-surface layers (r > 0.97 R). In this work, we took great care to recover the actual mode characteristics using a physically motivated model which included a complete leakage matrix. We included in our analysis the following instrumental characteristics: the correct instantaneous image scale, the radial and non-radial image distortions, the effective position angle of the solar rotation axis and a correction to the Carrington elements. We also present variations of the mode frequencies caused by the solar activity cycle. We have analyzed seven observational periods from 1999 to 2005 and correlated their frequency shift with four different solar indices. The frequency shift scaled by the relative mode inertia is a function of frequency alone and follows a simple power law, where the exponent obtained for the p modes is twice the value obtained for the f modes. The different solar indices present the same result. 
0808.02839	Quandle-like Structures From Groups	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Sriram Nagaraj	Abstract:  We define a class of quandle-like structures called pseudoquandles and analyze some of their algebraic properties. 
0808.02840	Can Early Dark Energy be Detected in Non-Linear Structure?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Matthew J. Francis, Geraint F. Lewis, Eric V. Linder	Abstract:  We present the first study of early dark energy cosmologies using N-body simulations to investigate the formation of non-linear structure. In contrast to expectations from semi-analytic approaches, we find that early dark energy does not imprint a unique signature on the statistics of non-linear structures. Investigating the non-linear power spectra and halo mass functions, we show that universal mass functions hold for early dark energy, making its presence difficult to distinguish from $Λ$CDM. Since early dark energy biases the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, the lack of discriminating power is problematic. 
0808.02841	Status of Very High Energy gamma-ray Astronomy as of early 2008	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Arache Djannati-Atai	Abstract:  Data obtained in the very high energy gamma-ray band with the new generation of imaging telescopes, in particular through the galactic plane survey undertaken by H.E.S.S., low threshold observations with MAGIC and more recently by operation of VERITAS, have revealed dozens of galactic and extragalactic sources, providing a wealth of information on a variety of high energy acceleration sites in our universe. Also, the water Cherenkov instrument Milagro has provided several extended sources after seven years of data integration. An overview of these results with focus on some of the most recent highlights is given. 
0808.02842	Unitarity and Holography in Gravitational Physics	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Donald Marolf	Abstract:  Because the gravitational Hamiltonian is a pure boundary term on-shell, asymptotic gravitational fields store information in a manner not possible in local field theories. This fact has consequences for both perturbative and non-perturbative quantum gravity. In perturbation theory about an asymptotically flat collapsing black hole, the algebra generated by asymptotic fields on future null infinity within any neighborhood of spacelike infinity contains a complete set of observables. Assuming that the same algebra remains complete at the non-perturbative quantum level, we argue that either 1) the S-matrix is unitary or 2) the dynamics in the region near timelike, null, and spacelike infinity is not described by perturbative quantum gravity about flat space. We also consider perturbation theory about a collapsing asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole, where we show that the algebra of boundary observables within any neighborhood of any boundary Cauchy surface is similarly complete. Whether or not this algebra continues to be complete non-perturbatively, the assumption that the Hamiltonian remains a boundary term implies that information available at the AdS boundary at any one time t_1 remains present at this boundary at any other time t_2. 
0808.02843	More localized automorphisms of the Cuntz algebras	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Roberto Conti, Jason Kimberley, Wojciech Szymanski	Abstract:  We completely determine the localized automorphisms of the Cuntz algebras $O_n$ corresponding to permutation matrices in $M_n \otimes M_n$ for $n=3$ and $n=4$. This result is obtained through a combination of general combinatorial techniques and large scale computer calculations. Our analysis proceeds according to the general scheme proposed in a previous paper, where we analyzed in detail the case of $O_2$ using labeled rooted trees. We also discuss those proper endomorphisms of these Cuntz algebras which restrict to automorphisms of their respective diagonals. In the case of $O_3$ we compute the number of automorphisms of the diagonal induced by permutation matrices in $M_3 \otimes M_3 \otimes M_3$. 
0808.02844	Growth mechanisms of vapor-born polymer films	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:I.J. Lee, Mira Yun, Sang-Min Lee, Ja-Yeon Kim	Abstract:  The surface morphologies of poly(chloro-p-xylylene) films were measured using atomic force microscopy and analyzed within the frame work of the dynamic scaling theory. The evolution of polymer films grown with fixed experimental parameters showed drastic changes of dynamic roughening behavior, which involve unusually high growth exponent (beta = 0.65+-0.03) in the initial growth regime, followed by a regime characterized by beta~0, and finally a crossover to beta = 0.18+-0.02 in a steady growth regime. Detailed scaling analysis of the surface fluctuation in Fourier space in terms of power spectral density revealed a gradual crossover in the global roughness exponent, analogous to a phase transition between two equilibrium states, from a morphology defined by alpha=1.36+-0.13 to the other morphology characterized by alpha=0.93+-0.04 as the film thickness increases. Our experimental results which significant deviate from the well established descriptions of film growth clearly exhibit that the dynamic roughening of polymer film is deeply affected by strong molecular interactions and relaxations of polymer chains. 
0808.02845	Holographic Thought Experiments	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Donald Marolf	Abstract:  The Hamiltonian of classical anti-de Sitter gravity is a pure boundary term on-shell. If this remains true in non-perturbative quantum gravity then i) boundary observables will evolve unitarily in time and ii) the algebra of boundary observables is the same at all times. In particular, information available at the boundary at any one time t_1 remains available at any other time t_2. Since there is also a sense in which the equations of motion propagate information into the bulk, these observations raise what may appear to be potential paradoxes concerning simultaneous (or spacelike separated) measurements of non-commuting observables, one at the asymptotic boundary and one in the interior. We argue that such potentially paradoxical settings always involve a breakdown of semi-classical gravity. In particular, we present evidence that making accurate holographic measurements over short timescales radically alters the familiar notion of causality. We also describe certain less intrinsically paradoxical settings which illustrate the above boundary unitarity and render the notion more concrete. 
0808.02846	Role of Compaction Ratio in the Mathematical Model of Progressive Collapse	Popular Physics (physics.pop-ph)	Authors:Charles M. Beck	Abstract:  We derive a mathematical model of progressive collapse and examine role of compaction. Contrary to a previous result by Bažant and Verdure, J. Engr. Mech. ASCE 133 (2006) 308, we find that compaction slows down the avalanche by effectively increasing the resistive force. We compare currently available estimates of the resistive force, that of Bažant and Verdure (2006) corrected for compaction for World Trade Center (WTC) 2, and of Beck, www.arxiv.org:physics/0609105, for WTC 1 and 2. We concentrate on a damage wave propagating through the building before the avalanche that figures in both models: an implicit heat wave that reduces the resistive force of the building by 60% in Bažant and Verdure (2006), or a wave of massive destruction that reduces the resistive force by 75% in Beck (2006). We show that the avalanche cannot supply the energy to the heat wave as this increases the resistive force by two orders of magnitude. We thus reaffirm the conclusion of Beck (2006) that the avalanche is initiated in the wake of the damage wave. 
0808.02847	Real AlphaBeta-Geometries	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Peter R. Law, Yasuo Matsushita	Abstract:  By a real alphabeta-geometry we mean a four-dimensional manifold M equipped with a neutral metric h such that (M,h) admits both an integrable distribution of alpha-planes and an integrable distribution of beta-planes. We obtain a local characterization of the metric when at least one of the distributions is parallel (i.e., is a Walker geometry) and the three-dimensional distribution spanned by the alpha- and beta-distributions is integrable. The case when both distributions are parallel, which has been called two-sided Walker geometry, is obtained as a special case. We also consider real αβ-geometries for which the corresponding spinors are both multiple Weyl principal spinors. 
0808.02848	Probing $e^{+}e^{-}$ annihilation in noncommutative electroweak model	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Chien Yu Chen	Abstract:  If the twist $Poincar\acute{e}$ transformation is imposed on the noncommutative spacetime, then $Lorentz$ invariance cannot be applied on QFT. To data, noncommutative theory is one of the best candidates to modify $Lorentz$ transformation. In this paper, we argue parity violation under the process of $e^{+}e^{-}\toγγ$ and make a detailed analysis of the difference behavior of each helicity state on noncommutative spacetime. The effect arises from the production of spin and magnetic fields. We check the energy momentum conservation for all used couplings and discover that if the electric field changes particle energy spectrum, there is no symmetry violation as the field produces a longitudinal state on the finial triple boson couplings. 
0808.02849	Symmetric Functions and Caps	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Erik Carlsson	Abstract:  Given a finite subset S in F_p^d, let a(S) be the number of distinct r-tuples (x_1,...,x_r) in S such that x_1+...+x_r = 0. We consider the "moments" F(m,n) = sum_|S|=n a(S)^m. Specifically, we present an explicit formula for F(m,n) as a product of two matrices, ultimately yielding a polynomial in q=p^d. The first matrix is independent of n while the second makes no mention of finite fields. However, the complexity of calculating each grows with m. The main tools here are the Schur-Weyl duality theorem, and some elementary properties of symmetric functions. This problem is closely to the study of maximal caps. 
0808.02850	Padé expansion and nucleon-nucleon scattering in coupled channels	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:D. Liu, J.-F. Yang	Abstract:  We extend our Padé-aided analysis of the nonperturbative renormalization of nucleon-nucleon scattering to the case of coupled channels. 
0808.02851	The Haar system in the preduals of hyperfinite factors	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Denis Potapov, Fyodor Sukochev	Abstract:  We shall present examples of Schauder bases in the preduals to the hyperfinite factors of types $\hbox{II}_1$, $\hbox{II}_\infty$, $\hbox{III}_λ$, $0 < λ\leq 1$. In the semifinite (respectively, purely infinite) setting, these systems form Schauder bases in any associated separable symmetric space of measurable operators (respectively, in any non-commutative $L^p$-space). 
0808.02852	Knots yielding homeomorphic lens spaces by Dehn surgery	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Toshio Saito, Masakazu Teragaito	Abstract:  We show that there exist infinitely many pairs of distinct knots in the 3-sphere such that each pair can yield homeomorphic lens spaces by the same Dehn surgery. Moreover, each knot of the pair can be chosen to be a torus knot, a satellite knot or a hyperbolic knot, except that both cannot be satellite knots simultaneously. This exception is shown to be unavoidable by the classical theory of binary quadratic forms. 
0808.02853	Lectures on BRS invariance for massive boson fields	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Jose M. Gracia-Bondia	Abstract:  These notes correspond to lectures given at the Villa de Leyva Summer School in Colombia (July 2007). Our main purpose in this short course on BRS invariance of gauge theories is to illuminate corners of the theory left in the shade by standard treatments. The plan is as follows. First a review of Utiyama's "general gauge theory". Promptly we find a counterexample to it in the shape of the massive spin-1 Stueckelberg gauge field. This is not fancy, as the massive case is the most natural one to introduce BRS invariance in the context of free quantum fields. Mathematically speaking, the first part of the course uses Utiyama's notation, and thus has the flavour and non-intrinsic notation of standard physics textbooks. Next we deal with boson fields on Fock space and BRS invariance in connection with the existence of Krein operators; the attending rigour points are then addressed. 
0808.02854	Unbounded Fredholm modules and double operator integrals	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Denis Potapov, Fyodor Sukochev	Abstract:  In noncommutative geometry one is interested in invariants such as the Fredholm index or spectral flow and their calculation using cyclic cocycles. A variety of formulae have been established under side conditions called summability constraints. These can be formulated in two ways, either for spectral triples or for bounded Fredholm modules. We study the relationship between these by proving various properties of the map on unbounded self adjoint operators $D$ given by $f(D)=D(1+D^2)^{-1/2}$. In particular we prove commutator estimates which are needed for the bounded case. In fact our methods work in the setting of semifinite noncommutative geometry where one has $D$ as an unbounded self adjoint linear operator affiliated with a semi-finite von Neumann algebra $\aM$. More precisely we show that for a pair $D,D_0$ of such operators with $D-D_0$ a bounded self-adjoint linear operator from $\aM$ and $ ({\bf 1}+D_0^2)^{-1/2}\in \sE$, where $\sE$ is a noncommutative symmetric space associated with $\aM$, then $$ \Vert f(D) - f (D_0) \Vert_{\sE} \leq C\cdot \Vert D-D_0\Vert_{\aM}. $$ This result is further used to show continuous differentiability of the mapping between an odd $\sE$-summable spectral triple and its bounded counterpart. 
0808.02855	Comment on "Failure of the work-Hamiltonian connection for free-energy calculations" by Jose M. G. Vilar and J. Miguel Rubi	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Luca Peliti	Abstract:  I point out that the arguments raised by Vilar and Rubi against the work-Hamiltonian connection in free-energy calculations imply, if correct, the failure of the statistical mechanical expression of the thermodynamical free-energy via the logarithm of the partition function. 
0808.02856	Non- (quantum) differentiable $C^1$-functions in the spaces with trivial Boyd indices	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Denis Potapov, Fyodor Sukochev	Abstract:  If E is a separable symmetric sequence space with trivial Boyd indices and $\cC^E$ is the corresponding ideal of compact operators, then there exists a $C^1$-function $f_E$, a self-adjoint element $W\in \cC^E$ and a densely defined closed symmetric derivation $δ$ on $\cC^E$ such that $W \in Dom δ$, but $f_E(W) \notin Dom δ$. 
0808.02857	Localized Modes in Type II and Heterotic Singular Calabi-Yau Conformal Field Theories	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Shun'ya Mizoguchi	Abstract:  We consider type II and heterotic string compactifications on an isolated singularity in the noncompact Gepner model approach. The conifold-type ADE noncompact Calabi-Yau threefolds, as well as the ALE twofolds, are modeled by a tensor product of the SL(2,R)/U(1) Kazama-Suzuki model and an N=2 minimal model. Based on the string partition functions on these internal Calabi-Yaus previously obtained by Eguchi and Sugawara, we construct new modular invariant, space-time supersymmetric partition functions for both type II and heterotic string theories, where the GSO projection is performed before the continuous and discrete state contributions are separated. We investigate in detail the massless spectra of the localized modes. In particular, we propose an interesting three generation model, in which each flavor is in the 27+1 representation of E6 and localized on a four-dimensional space-time residing at the tip of the cigar. 
0808.02858	Switching magnetic vortex core by a single nanosecond current pulse	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Keisuke Yamada (1), Shinya Kasai (1), Yoshinobu Nakatani (2), Kensuke Kobayashi (1), Teruo Ono (1) ((1)Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto Univeristy, (2)University of Electro-communications)    	Abstract:  In a ferromagnetic nanodisk, the magnetization tends to swirl around in the plane of the disk and can point either up or down at the center of this magnetic vortex. This binary state can be useful for information storage. It is demonstrated that a single nanosecond current pulse can switch the core polarity. This method also provides the precise control of the core direction, which constitutes fundamental technology for realizing a vortex core memory. 
0808.02859	Simple homotopy invariance of higher signatures	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Renyi Ma	Abstract:  We prove that the higher signature for any close oriented manifold is a simple-homotopy invariant. 
0808.02860	Three-Dimensional Simulations of Magnetized Thin Accretion Disks around Black Holes: Stress in the Plunging Region	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Rebecca Shafee (1), Jonathan C. McKinney (2), Ramesh Narayan (3), Alexander Tchekhovskoy (3), Charles F. Gammie (4), Jeffrey E. McClintock (3) ((1) Harvard University, Department of Physics, (2) Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, Stanford University, (3) Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, (4) Center for Theoretical Astrophysics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)    	Abstract:  We describe three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a geometrically thin accretion disk around a non-spinning black hole. The disk has a thickness $h/r\sim0.05-0.1$ over the radial range $(2-20)GM/c^2$. In steady state, the specific angular momentum profile of the inflowing magnetized gas deviates by less than 2% from that of the standard thin disk model of Novikov & Thorne (1973). Also, the magnetic torque at the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) is only $\sim2%$ of the inward flux of angular momentum at this radius. Both results indicate that magnetic coupling across the ISCO is relatively unimportant for geometrically thin disks. 
0808.02861	Energy of tsunami waves generated by bottom motion	Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)	Authors:Denys Dutykh (LM-Savoie, Cmla), Frédéric Dias (CMLA, LRC Meso)    	Abstract:  In the vast literature on tsunami research, few articles have been devoted to energy issues. A theoretical investigation on the energy of waves generated by bottom motion is performed here. We start with the full incompressible Euler equations in the presence of a free surface and derive both dispersive and non-dispersive shallow-water equations with an energy equation. It is shown that dispersive effects only appear at higher order in the energy budget. Then we solve the Cauchy-Poisson problem of tsunami generation for the linearized water wave equations. Exchanges between potential and kinetic energies are clearly revealed. 
0808.02862	Symplectic inverse spectral theory for pseudodifferential operators	Spectral Theory (math.SP)	Authors:San Vu Ngoc (IRMAR)    	Abstract:  We prove, under some generic assumptions, that the semiclassical spectrum modulo O(h^2) of a one dimensional pseudodifferential operator completely determines the symplectic geometry of the underlying classical system. In particular, the spectrum determines the hamiltonian dynamics of the principal symbol. 
0808.02863	Bayesian nonparametric estimators derived from conditional Gibbs structures	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Antonio Lijoi, Igor Prünster, Stephen G. Walker	Abstract:  We consider discrete nonparametric priors which induce Gibbs-type exchangeable random partitions and investigate their posterior behavior in detail. In particular, we deduce conditional distributions and the corresponding Bayesian nonparametric estimators, which can be readily exploited for predicting various features of additional samples. The results provide useful tools for genomic applications where prediction of future outcomes is required. 
0808.02864	Bound States in Gapped Graphene with Impurities : Effective Low-Energy Description of Short-Range Interactions	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Kumar S. Gupta, Siddhartha Sen	Abstract:  We obtain a novel bound state spectrum of the low energy excitations near the Fermi points of graphene in the presence of a charge impurity. The effects of possible short range interactions induced by the impurity are modelled by suitable boundary conditions. The spectrum in the subcritical region of the effective Coulomb coupling is labelled by a parameter which characterizes the boundary conditions and determines the inequivalent quantizations of the system. In the supercritical region we obtain a renormalization group flow for the effective Coulomb coupling. 
0808.02865	Central limit theorem for a many-server queue with random service rates	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Rami Atar	Abstract:  Given a random variable $N$ with values in ${\mathbb{N}}$, and $N$ i.i.d. positive random variables $\{μ_k\}$, we consider a queue with renewal arrivals and $N$ exponential servers, where server $k$ serves at rate $μ_k$, under two work conserving routing schemes. In the first, the service rates $\{μ_k\}$ need not be known to the router, and each customer to arrive at a time when some servers are idle is routed to the server that has been idle for the longest time (or otherwise it is queued). In the second, the service rates are known to the router, and a customer that arrives to find idle servers is routed to the one whose service rate is greatest. In the many-server heavy traffic regime of Halfin and Whitt, the process that represents the number of customers in the system is shown to converge to a one-dimensional diffusion with a random drift coefficient, where the law of the drift depends on the routing scheme. A related result is also provided for nonrandom environments. 
0808.02866	Differential structure on the $κ$-Minkowski spacetime from twist	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Hyeong-Chan Kim, Youngone Lee, Chaiho Rim, Jae Hyung Yee	Abstract:  We study four dimensional $κ$-Minkowski spacetime constructed by the twist deformation of $U(igl(4,R))$. We demonstrate that the differential structure of such twist-deformed $κ$-Minkowski spacetime is closed in four dimensions contrary to the construction of $κ$-Poincaré bicovariant calculus which needs an extra fifth dimension. Our construction holds in arbitrary dimensional spacetimes. 
0808.02867	Hemispherical power asymmetry: parameter estimation from CMB WMAP5 data	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Bartosz Lew	Abstract:  We reexamine the evidence of the hemispherical power asymmetry, detected in the CMB WMAP data using a new method. At first, we analyze the hemispherical variance ratios and compare these with simulated distributions. Secondly, working within a previously-proposed CMB bipolar modulation model, we constrain model parameters: the amplitude and the orientation of the modulation field as a function of various multipole bins. Finally, we select three ranges of multipoles leading to the most anomalous signals, and we process corresponding 100 Gaussian, random field (GRF) simulations, treated as observational data, to further test the statistical significance and robustness of the hemispherical power asymmetry. For our analysis we use the Internally-Linearly-Coadded (ILC) full sky map, and KQ75 cut-sky V channel, foregrounds reduced map of the WMAP five year data (V5). We constrain the modulation parameters using a generic maximum a posteriori method. In particular, we find differences in hemispherical power distribution, which when described in terms of a model with bipolar modulation field, exclude the field amplitude value of the isotropic model A=0 at confidence level of ~99.5% (~99.4%) in the multipole range l=[7,19] (l=[7,79]) in the V5 data, and at the confidence level ~99.9% in the multipole range l=[7,39] in the ILC5 data, with the best fit (modal PDF) values in these particular multipole ranges of A=0.21 (A=0.21) and A=0.15 respectively. However, we also point out that similar or larger significances (in terms of rejecting the isotropic model), and large best-fit modulation amplitudes are obtained in GRF simulations as well, which reduces the overall significance of the CMB power asymmetry down to only about 94% (95%) in the V5 data, in the range l=[7,19] (l=[7,79]). 
0808.02868	Measurement of the solar 8B neutrino rate with a liquid scintillator target and 3 MeV energy threshold in the Borexino detector	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:The Borexino Collaboration	Abstract:  We report the measurement of electron neutrino elastic scattering from 8B solar neutrinos with 3 MeV energy threshold by the Borexino detector in Gran Sasso (Italy). The rate of solar neutrino-induced electron scattering events above this energy in Borexino is 0.217 +- 0.038 (stat) +- 0.008 (syst) cpd/100 t, which corresponds to the equivalent unoscillated flux of (2.4 +- 0.4 (stat) +- 0.1 (syst))x10^6 cm^-2 s^-1, in good agreement with measurements from SNO and SuperKamiokaNDE. Assuming the 8B neutrino flux predicted by the high metallicity Standard Solar Model, the average 8B neutrino survival probability above 3 MeV is measured to be 0.29+-0.10. The survival probabilities for 7Be and 8B neutrinos as measured by Borexino differ by 1.9 sigma. These results are consistent with the prediction of the MSW-LMA solution of a transition in the solar electron neutrino survival probability between the low energy vacuum-driven and the high-energy matter-enhanced solar neutrino oscillation regimes. 
0808.02869	On the Power of Quantum Encryption Keys	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Akinori Kawachi, Christopher Portmann	Abstract:  The standard definition of quantum state randomization, which is the quantum analog of the classical one-time pad, consists in applying some transformation to the quantum message conditioned on a classical secret key $k$. We investigate encryption schemes in which this transformation is conditioned on a quantum encryption key state $ρ_k$ instead of a classical string, and extend this symmetric-key scheme to an asymmetric-key model in which copies of the same encryption key $ρ_k$ may be held by several different people, but maintaining information-theoretical security. We find bounds on the message size and the number of copies of the encryption key which can be safely created in these two models in terms of the entropy of the decryption key, and show that the optimal bound can be asymptotically reached by a scheme using classical encryption keys. This means that the use of quantum states as encryption keys does not allow more of these to be created and shared, nor encrypt larger messages, than if these keys are purely classical. 
0808.02870	Measuring Distance and Properties of the Milky Way's Central Supermassive Black Hole with Stellar Orbits	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. M. Ghez, S. Salim, N. N. Weinberg, J. R. Lu, T. Do, J. K. Dunn, K. Matthews, M. Morris, S. Yelda, E. E. Becklin, T. Kremenek, M. Milosavljevic, J. Naiman	Abstract:  We report new precision measurements of the properties of our Galaxy's supermassive black hole. Based on astrometric (1995-2007) and radial velocity (2000-2007) measurements from the W. M. Keck 10-meter telescopes, a fully unconstrained Keplerian orbit for the short period star S0-2 provides values for Ro of 8.0+-0.6 kpc, M_bh of 4.1+-0.6x10^6 Mo, and the black hole's radial velocity, which is consistent with zero with 30 km/s uncertainty. If the black hole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the Galaxy, we can further constrain the fit and obtain Ro = 8.4+-0.4 kpc and M_bh = 4.5+-0.4x10^6 Mo. More complex models constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be less than 3-4x10^5 Mo within 0.01 pc, ~100x higher than predictions from stellar and stellar remnant models. For all models, we identify transient astrometric shifts from source confusion and the assumptions regarding the black hole's radial motion as previously unrecognized limitations on orbital accuracy and the usefulness of fainter stars. Future astrometric and RV observations will remedy these effects. Our estimates of Ro and the Galaxy's local rotation speed, which it is derived from combining Ro with the apparent proper motion of Sgr A*, (theta0 = 229+-18 km/s), are compatible with measurements made using other methods. The increased black hole mass found in this study, compared to that determined using projected mass estimators, implies a longer period for the innermost stable orbit, longer resonant relaxation timescales for stars in the vicinity of the black hole and a better agreement with the M_bh-sigma relation. 
0808.02871	Torsional oscillator and synchrotron x-ray experiments on solid 4He in aerogel	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:N. Mulders, J.T. West, M.H.W. Chan, C.N. Kodituwakku, C.A. Burns, L.B. Lurio	Abstract:  X-ray diffraction experiments show that solid 4He grown in aerogel is highly polycrystalline, with a hcp crystal structure (as in bulk) and a crystallite size of approximately 100 nm. In contrast to the expectation that the highly disordered solid will have a large supersolid fraction, torsional oscillator measurements show a behavior that is strikingly similar to high purity crystals grown from the superfluid phase. The low temperature supersolid fraction is only ~3x10-4 and the onset temperature is ~ 100 mK. 
0808.02872	X-ray Studies of Structure and Defects in Solid 4He from 50 mK to Melting	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:C.A. Burns, N. Mulders, L. Lurio, M.H.W. Chan, A. Said, C.N. Kodituwakku, P.M. Platzman	Abstract:  Recent measurements have found non-classical rotational inertia (NCRI) in solid 4He starting at T ~ 200 mK, leading to speculation that a supersolid state may exist in these materials. Differences in the NCRI fraction due to the growth method and annealing history imply that defects play an important role in the effect. Using x-ray synchrotron radiation, we have studied the nature of the crystals and the properties of the defects in solid 4He at temperatures down to 50 mK. Measurements of peak intensities and lattice parameters do not show indications of the supersolid transition. Using growth methods similar to those of groups measuring the NCRI we find that large crystals form. Scanning with a small (down to 10 x 10 um2) beam, we resolve a mosaic structure within these crystals consistent with numerous small angle grain boundaries. The mosaic shows significant shifts over time even at temperatures far from melting. We discuss the relevance of these defects to the NCRI observations. 
0808.02873	Electromagnetic wave transmission through a small hole in a perfect electric conductor of finite thickness	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:A. Yu. Nikitin, D. Zueco, F.J.Garcia-Vidal, L.Martin-Moreno	Abstract:  The non-resonant electromagnetic transmission of a normal-incident plane wave through a single hole in a perfect conductor metal slab of finite width is studied. The cases of rectangular and circular holes are treated in detail. For holes in the extreme subwavelength regime, in a film of finite thickness, the transmittance is shown to have the Rayleigh dependency upon the wavelength and, in addition, is mainly suppressed due to attenuation of the fundamental waveguide mode. In the limit of an infinitesimally thin screen Bethe's result is recovered for the circular hole. The numerical computations are fitted, providing expressions for the transmission in a wide region of parameters. We reformulate our results in terms of multipole expansion, interpreting the waveguide modes inside the hole as induced multipole moments. This result provides the link between the modal expansion method and the one based on a multipole expansion. 
0808.02874	Implementation of many-qubit Grover search by cavity QED	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:H. Q. Fan, W. L. Yang, X. R. Huang, M. Feng	Abstract:  We study the possibility of an implementation of N-qubit (N>3) Grover search in cavity QED, based on a fast operation of N-qubit controlled phase-flip with atoms in resonance with the cavity mode. We demonstrate both analytically and numerically that, our scheme could be achieved efficiently to find a marked state with high fidelity and high success probability. As cavity decay is involved in our quantum trajectory treatment, we could analytically understand the implementation of a Grover search subject to dissipation, which would be very helpful for relevant experiments. 
0808.02875	A New Method of Calculating the Running Coupling Constant	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Erek Bilgici, Antonino Flachi, Etsuko Itou, Masafumi Kurachi, C.-J David Lin, Hideo Matsufuru, Hiroshi Ohki, Tetsuya Onogi, Takeshi Yamazaki	Abstract:  We propose a new method to compute the running coupling constant of gauge theories on the lattice. We first give the definition of the running coupling in the new scheme using the Wilson loops in a finite volume, and explain how the running of the coupling constant is extracted from the measurement of the volume dependence. The perturbative calculation of the renormalization constant to define the scheme is also given at the leading order. As a benchmark test of the new scheme we apply the method the case of the quenched QCD. We show the preliminary result from our numerical simulations which are carried out with plaquette gauge action for various lattice sizes and bare lattice couplings. With techniques to improve the statistical accuracy, we show that we can determine the non-perturbative running of the coupling constant in a wide range of the energy scale with relatively small number of gauge configurations in our scheme. We compare our lattice data of the running coupling constant with perturbative renormalization group evolution at one- and two-loop order, and confirm the consistency between them at high energy. 
0808.02876	Kinetics of geminate recombination of subdiffusing particles in the presence of interparticle interaction	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:A. I. Shushin	Abstract:  The kinetics of geminate subdiffusion-assisted reactions (SDARs) of interacting particles is analyzed in detail with the use of the non-Markovian fractional Smoluchowki equation (FSE). It is suggested that the interparticle interaction potential is of the shape of potential well and reactivity is located within the well. The reaction kinetics is studied in the limit of deep well, in which the FSE can be solved analytically. This solution enables one to obtain the kinetics in a simple analytical form. The analytical expression shows that the SDAR kinetics fairly substantially depends on the mechanism of reactivity within the well. Specific features of the kinetics are thoroughly analyzed in two models of reactivity: the subdiffusion assisted activated rate model and the first order reaction model. The theory developed is applied to the interpretation of experimental kinetics of photoluminescence decay in amorphous $a$-Si:H semiconductors governed by geminate recombination of electrons and holes which are recently found to undergo subdiffusive relative motion. Analysis of results demonstrates that the subdiffusion assisted activated rate mechanism of reaction is closer to reality as applied to amorphous $a$-Si:H semiconductors. Comparison of experimental and theoretical kinetics allowed for obtaining some kinetic parameters of the systems under study: the rate of escaping from the well and the parameter characterizing the deviation of the subdiffusive motion from the conventional one. 
0808.02877	Stein's method for discrete Gibbs measures	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Peter Eichelsbacher, Gesine Reinert	Abstract:  Stein's method provides a way of bounding the distance of a probability distribution to a target distribution $μ$. Here we develop Stein's method for the class of discrete Gibbs measures with a density $e^V$, where $V$ is the energy function. Using size bias couplings, we treat an example of Gibbs convergence for strongly correlated random variables due to Chayes and Klein [Helv. Phys. Acta 67 (1994) 30--42]. We obtain estimates of the approximation to a grand-canonical Gibbs ensemble. As side results, we slightly improve on the Barbour, Holst and Janson [Poisson Approximation (1992)] bounds for Poisson approximation to the sum of independent indicators, and in the case of the geometric distribution we derive better nonuniform Stein bounds than Brown and Xia [Ann. Probab. 29 (2001) 1373--1403]. 
0808.02878	Stability of the slow manifold in the primitive equations	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:R. Temam, D. Wirosoetisno	Abstract:  We show that, under reasonably mild hypotheses, the solution of the forced--dissipative rotating primitive equations of the ocean loses most of its fast, inertia--gravity, component in the small Rossby number limit as $t\to\infty$. At leading order, the solution approaches what is known as "geostrophic balance" even under ageostrophic, slowly time-dependent forcing. Higher-order results can be obtained if one further assumes that the forcing is time-independent and sufficiently smooth. If the forcing lies in some Gevrey space, the solution will be exponentially close to a finite-dimensional "slow manifold" after some time. 
0808.02879	Critical temperature of antikaon condensation in nuclear matter	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Sarmistha Banik, Walter Greiner, Debades Bandyopadhyay	Abstract:  We investigate the critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation of $K^-$ mesons in neutron star matter. This is studied within the framework of relativistic field theoretical models at finite temperature where nucleon-nucleon and (anti)kaon-nucleon interactions are mediated by the exchange of mesons. The melting of the antikaon condensate is studied for different values of antikaon optical potential depths. We find that the critical temperature of antikaon condensation increases with baryon number density. Further it is noted that the critical temperature is lowered as antikaon optical potential becomes less attractive. We also construct the phase diagram of neutron star matter with $K^-$ condensate. 
0808.02880	Masses and Magnetic moments of Triply Heavy Flavour Baryons in Hypercentral Model	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Bhavin Patel, Ajay Majethiya, P. C. Vinodkumar	Abstract:  Triply heavy flavour baryons are studied using the hyper central description of the three-body system. The confinement potential is assumed as hyper central coulomb plus power potential with power index $p$. The ground state ($J^P={1/2}^+$ and ${3/2}^+$) masses of heavy flavour baryons are computed for different power index, $ p$ starting from 0.5 to 2.0. The predicted masses are found to attain a saturated value with respect to variation in $p$ beyond the power index $p>1.0$. Using the spin-flavour structure of the constituting quarks and by defining effective mass of the confined quarks within the baryons, the magnetic moments are computed with no additional free parameters. 
0808.02881	A concrete co-existential map that is not confluent	General Topology (math.GN)	Authors:Klaas Pieter Hart	Abstract:  We give a concrete example of a co-existential map between continua that is not confluent. 
0808.02882	Tunneling properties of a bound pair of Fermi atoms in an optical lattice	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Yoji Ohashi	Abstract:  We investigate tunneling properties of a bound pair of Fermi atoms in an optical lattice, comparing with results obtained in an attractive Hubbard model. In the strong coupling regime of the Hubbard model, it has been predicted that the motion of a bound pair between lattice sites is accompanied by virtual dissociation. To explore the possibility of this interesting phenomenon in optical lattice, we calculate molecular wavefunction in a cosine-shape periodic potential. We show that the molecular tunneling accompanied by dissociation occurs in the intermediate coupling regime of the optical lattice system. In the strong coupling regime, in contrast to the prediction in the Hubbard model, the bound pair is shown to tunnel through lattice potential without dissociation. As a result, the magnitude of molecular band mass M remains finite even in the strong coupling limit, which is in contrast to the diverging molecular mass in the case of the Hubbard model. Including this finite value of molecular band mass, we evaluate the superfluid phase transition temperature Tc in the BEC limit of the optical lattice system, where the Hubbard model gives Tc=0 due to the diverging molecular mass. 
0808.02883	Low angular momentum flow model of Sgr A* activity	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:B. Czerny, M. Moscibrodzka	Abstract:  Sgr A* is the closest massive black hole and can be observed with the highest angular resolution. Nevertheless, our current understanding of the accretion process in this source is very poor. The inflow is almost certainly of low radiative efficiency and it is accompanied by a strong outflow and the flow is strongly variable but the details of the dynamics are unknown. Even the amount of angular momentum in the flow is an open question. Here we argue that low angular momentum scenario is better suited to explain the flow variability. We present a new hybrid model which describes such a flow and consists of an outer spherically symmetric Bondi flow and an inner axially symmetric flow described through MHD simulations. The assumed angular momentum of the matter is low, i.e. the corresponding circularization radius in the equatorial plane of the flow is just above the innermost stable circular orbit in pseudo-Newtonian potential. We compare the radiation spectrum from such a flow to the broad band observational data for Sgr A*. 
0808.02884	A novel multi-frequency technique for the detection of point sources in Cosmic Microwave Background maps	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:D. Herranz, M. Lopez-Caniego, J. L. Sanz, J. Gonzalez-Nuevo	Abstract:  In this work we address the problem of simultaneous multi-frequency detection of extragalactic point sources in maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background. We apply a new linear filtering technique, the so called `matched matrix filters', that incorporates full spatial information, including the cross-correlation among channels, without making any a priori assumption about the spectral behaviour of the sources. A substantial reduction of the background is achieved thanks to the optimal combination of filtered maps. We describe in detail the new technique and we apply it to the detection/estimation of radio sources in realistic all-sky Planck simulations at 30, 44, 70 and 100 GHz. Then we compare the results with the mono-frequential approach based on the standard matched filter, in terms of reliability, completeness and flux accuracy of the resulting point source catalogs. The new filters outperform the standard matched filters for all these indexes at 30, 44 and 70 GHz, whereas at 100 GHz both kind of filters have a similar performance. We find a noticeable increment of the number of true detections for a fixed reliability level. In particular, for a 95% reliability we practically double the number of detections at 30, 44 and 70 GHz.

Roy	Abstract:  Cross sections, kinetic energy and angular distributions of fragments with charge 6$\le$Z$\le$28 emitted in 78,82Kr+40C at 5.5 MeV/A reactions were measured at the GANIL facility using the INDRA apparatus. This experiment aims to investigate the influence of the neutron enrichment on the decay mechanism of excited nuclei. Data are discussed in comparison with predictions of transition state and Hauser-Feshbach models.

0808.02887	GaMnAs: layers, wires and dots	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Janusz Sadowski	Abstract:  Thin layers of GaMnAs ferromagnetic semiconductor grown by molecular beam epitaxy on GaAs(001) substrates were studied. To improve their magnetic properties the post-growth annealing procedures were applied, using the surface passivation layers of amorphous arsenic. This post growth treatment effectively increases the ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic phase transition temperature in GaMnAs, and provides surface-rich MnAs layer which can be used for formation of low dimensional structures such as superlattices. If the surface rich MnAs layer consists of MnAs dots, then it is possible to grow Mn-doped GaAs nanowires 
0808.02888	Properties of $Q\bar{Q}$ $(Q εb, c)$ mesons in Coulomb plus Power potential	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Bhavin Patel, P.C.Vinodkumar	Abstract:  The decay rates and spectroscopy of the $Q \bar Q$ $(Q \in c, b)$ mesons are computed in non-relativistic phenomenological quark antiquark potential of the type $V(r)=-\frac{α_c}{r}+A r^ν$, (CPP$_ν$) with different choices $ν$. Numerical solution of the schrodinger equation has been used to obtain the spectroscopy of $Q\bar{Q}$ mesons. The spin hyperfine, spin-orbit and tensor components of the one gluon exchange interaction are employed to compute the spectroscopy of the few lower $S$ and orbital excited states. The numerically obtained radial solutions are employed to obtain the decay constant, di-gamma and di-leptonic decay widths. The decay widths are determined with and without radiative corrections. Present results are compared with other potential model predictions as well as with the known experimental values. 
0808.02889	Radio emission from exoplanets: the role of the stellar coronal density and magnetic field strength	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Jardine, A.C. Cameron	Abstract:  The search for radio emission from extra-solar planets has so far been unsuccessful. Much of the effort in modelling the predicted emission has been based on the analogy with the well-known emission from Jupiter. Unlike Jupiter, however, many of the targets of these radio searches are so close to their parent stars that they may well lie inside the stellar magnetosphere. For these close-in planets we determine which physical processes dominate the radio emission and compare our results to those for large-orbit planets that are immersed in the stellar wind. We have modelled the reconnection of the stellar and planetary magnetic fields. We calculate the extent of the planetary magnetosphere if it is in pressure balance with its surroundings and determine the conditions under which reconnection of the stellar and planetary magnetic fields could provide the accelerated electrons necessary for the predicted radio emission. We show that received radio fluxes of tens of mJy are possible for exoplanets in the solar neighbourhood that are close to their parent stars if their stars have surface field strengths above 1-10G. We show that for these close-in planets, the power of the radio emission depends principally on the ratio (Nc/B^{1/3})^2 where Nc is the density at the base of the stellar corona, and B is the stellar surface magnetic field strength. Radio emission is most likely to be detected from planets around stars with high-density coronae, which are therefore likely to be bright X-ray sources. The dependence of stellar coronal density on stellar rotation rate and effective temperature is crucial in predicting radio fluxes from exoplanets. 
0808.02890	Quantum dot spectroscopy using cavity QED	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Martin Winger, Antonio Badolato, Kevin Hennessy, Evelyn Hu, Atac Imamoglu	Abstract:  Cavity quantum electrodynamics has attracted substantial interest, both due to its potential role in the field of quantum information processing and as a testbed for basic experiments in quantum mechanics. Here, we show how cavity quantum electrodynamics using a tunable photonic crystal nanocavity in the strong coupling regime can be used for single quantum dot spectroscopy. From the distinctive avoided crossings observed in the strongly coupled system we can identify the neutral and single positively charged exciton as well as the biexciton transitions. Moreover we are able to investigate the fine structure of those transitions and to identify a novel cavity mediated mixing of bright and dark exciton states, where the hyperfine interactions with lattice nuclei presumably play a key role. These results are enabled by a deterministic coupling scheme which allowed us to achieve unprecedented coupling strengths in excess of 0.15 meV. 
0808.02891	Crossover from hc/e to hc/2e current oscillations in rings of s-wave superconductors	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:F. Loder, A. P. Kampf, T. Kopp	Abstract:  We analyze the crossover from an hc/e-periodicity of the persistent current in flux threaded clean metallic rings towards an hc/2e-flux periodicity of the supercurrent upon entering the superconducting state. On the basis of a model calculation for a one-dimensional ring we identify the underlying mechanism, which balances the hc/e versus the hc/2e periodic components of the current density. When the ring circumference exceeds the coherence length of the superconductor, the flux dependence is strictly hc/2e periodic. Further, we develop a multi-channel model which reduces the Bogoliubov - de Gennes equations to a one-dimensional differential equation for the radial component of the wave function. The discretization of this differential equation introduces transverse channels, whose number scales with the thickness of the ring. The periodicity crossover is analyzed close the critical temperature. 
0808.02892	On honest times in financial modeling	Computational Finance (q-fin.CP)	Authors:Ashkan Nikeghbali, Eckhard Platen	Abstract:  This paper demonstrates the usefulness and importance of the concept of honest times to financial modeling. It studies a financial market with asset prices that follow jump-diffusions with negative jumps. The central building block of the market model is its growth optimal portfolio (GOP), which maximizes the growth rate of strictly positive portfolios. Primary security account prices, when expressed in units of the GOP, turn out to be nonnegative local martingales. In the proposed framework an equivalent risk neutral probability measure need not exist. Derivative prices are obtained as conditional expectations of corresponding future payoffs, with the GOP as numeraire and the real world probability as pricing measure. The time when the global maximum of a portfolio with no positive jumps, when expressed in units of the GOP, is reached, is shown to be a generic representation of an honest time. We provide a general formula for the law of such honest times and compute the conditional distributions of the global maximum of a portfolio in this framework. Moreover, we provide a stochastic integral representation for uniformly integrable martingales whose terminal values are functions of the global maximum of a portfolio. These formulae are model independent and universal. We also specialize our results to some examples where we hedge a payoff that arrives at an honest time. 
0808.02893	Ordinary differential system in dinension six with affine Weyl group symmetry of type $D_4^{(2)}$	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Yusuke Sasano	Abstract:  We find a three-parameter family of ordinary differential systems in dimension six with affine Weyl group symmetry of type $D_4^{(2)}$. This is the second example which gave higher order Painlevé type systems of type $D_{4}^{(2)}$. We show that we give its symmetry and holomorphy conditions. These symmetries, holomorphy conditions and invariant divisors are new. 
0808.02894	Functional Analysis of Spontaneous Cell Movement under Different Physiological Conditions	Cell Behavior (q-bio.CB)	Authors:Hiroaki Takagi, Masayuki J. Sato, Toshio Yanagida, Masahiro Ueda	Abstract:  Cells can show not only spontaneous movement but also tactic responses to environmental signals. Since the former can be regarded as the basis to realize the latter, playing essential roles in various cellular functions, it is important to investigate spontaneous movement quantitatively at different physiological conditions in relation to cellular physiological functions. For that purpose, we observed a series of spontaneous movements by Dictyostelium cells at different developmental periods by using a single cell tracking system. Using statistical analysis of these traced data, we found that cells showed complex dynamics with anomalous diffusion and that their velocity distribution had power-law tails in all conditions. Furthermore, as development proceeded, average velocity and persistency of the movement increased and as too did the exponential behavior in the velocity distribution. Based on these results, we succeeded in applying a generalized Langevin model to the experimental data. With this model, we discuss the relation of spontaneous cell movement to cellular physiological function and its relevance to behavioral strategies for cell survival. 
0808.02895	Hyperbolic conservation laws on manifolds with limited regularity	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Philippe G. LeFloch, Baver Okutmustur	Abstract:  We introduce a formulation of the initial and boundary value problem for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws posed on a differential manifold endowed with a volume form, possibly with a boundary; in particular, this includes the important case of Lorentzian manifolds. Only limited regularity is assumed on the geometry of the manifold. For this problem, we establish the existence and uniqueness of an L1 semi-group of weak solutions satisfying suitable entropy and boundary conditions. 
0808.02896	Magnetic order in Pr2Pd3Ge5 and possible heavy fermion behavior in Pr2Rh3Ge5	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:V. K. Anand, Z. Hossain, C. Geibel	Abstract:  We report our results on two new ternary intermetallic compounds Pr$_{2}$Pd$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$ and Pr$_{2}$Rh$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$ based on magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, specific heat, resistivity and magnetoresistance data. These compounds form in U$_{2}$Co$_{3}$Si$_{5}$-type orthorhombic structure (space group \textit{Ibam}). Pr$_{2}$Pd$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$ exhibits two magnetic transitions at T$_{N1}$ = 7.5 K and T$_{N2}$ = 8.3 K. In the magnetically ordered state Pr$_{2}$Pd$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$ exhibits a field induced metamagnetic transition and unusually large magnetoresistance. Pr$_{2}$Rh$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$ does not show any phase transition down to 0.5 K. It has a CEF singlet ground state, separated from the first excited state by about 10 K. The low lying crystal field excitations lead to exciton mediated electronic mass enhancement as evidenced by large Sommerfeld coefficient ($γ$ $\sim$ 80 mJ/mol K$^2$) in Pr$_{2}$Rh$_{3}$Ge$_{5}$. 
0808.02897	Induced electromagnetic fields in non-linear QED	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:C.A. Dominguez, H. Falomir, M. Ipinza, M. Loewe, J.C. Rojas	Abstract:  The Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian is used to obtain general expressions for electric and magnetic fields induced by non-linearity, to leading order in the non-linear expansion parameter, and for quasistatic situations. These expressions are then used to compute the induced electromagnetic fields due to a spherical shell with uniform charge distribution on the surface, in the presence of an external constant magnetic field. The induced electric field contains several multipole terms with unusual angular dependences. Most importantly, the leading term of the induced magnetic field is due to an induced magnetic dipole moment. 
0808.02898	Electronic structure and nesting-driven enhancement of the RKKY interaction at the magnetic ordering propagation vector in Gd2PdSi3 and Tb2PdSi3	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:D. S. Inosov, D. V. Evtushinsky, A. Koitzsch, V. B. Zabolotnyy, S. V. Borisenko, A. A. Kordyuk, M. Frontzek, M. Loewenhaupt, W. Loeser, I. Mazilu, H. Bitterlich, G. Behr, J.-U. Hoffmann, R. Follath, B. Buechner	Abstract:  We present first-time measurements of the Fermi surface and low-energy electronic structure of intermetallic compounds Gd2PdSi3 and Tb2PdSi3 by means of angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES). Both materials possess a flower-like Fermi surface consisting of an electron barrel at the G point surrounded by spindle-shaped electron pockets originating from the same band. The band bottom of both features lies at 0.5 eV below the Fermi level. From the experimentally measured band structure, we estimate the momentum-dependent RKKY coupling strength and demonstrate that it is peaked at the 1/2 GK wave vector. Comparison with neutron diffraction data from the same crystals shows perfect agreement of this vector with the propagation vector of the low-temperature in-plane magnetic order, thereby demonstrating the decisive role of the Fermi surface geometry in explaining the complex magnetically ordered ground state of ternary rare earth silicides. 
0808.02899	The mid-infrared colour-magnitude relation of early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster as measured by Spitzer-IRS	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M.S. Clemens, A. Bressan, P. Panuzzo, R. Rampazzo, L. Silva, L. Buson, G.L. Granato	Abstract:  We use 16 micron, Spitzer-IRS, blue peakup photometry of 50 early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster to define the mid-infrared colour-magnitude relation. We compare with recent simple stellar population models that include the mid-infrared emission from the extended, dusty envelopes of evolved stars. The Ks-[16] colour in these models is very sensitive to the relative population of dusty Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. We find that the passively evolving early-type galaxies define a sequence of approximately constant age (~10 Gyr) with varying metallicity. Several galaxies that lie on the optical/near-infrared colour-magnitude relation do not lie on the mid-infrared relation. This illustrates the sensitivity of the Ks-[16] colour to age. The fact that a colour-magnitude relation is seen in the mid-infrared underlines the extremely passive nature of the majority (68%) of early-type galaxies in the Coma cluster. The corollary of this is that 32% of the early-type galaxies in our sample are not `passive', insofar as they are either significantly younger than 10 Gyr or they have had some rejuvenation episode within the last few Gyr. 
0808.02900	Unconventional pairing in excitonic condensates under spin-orbit coupling	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:M. Ali Can, T. Hakioğlu	Abstract:  It is shown that the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin orbit couplings enhance the conclusive power in the experiments on the excitonic condensed state by at least three low temperature effects. First, spin orbit coupling facilitates the photoluminescense measurements via enhancing the bright contribution in the otherwise dominantly dark exciton condensed state. The second is the presence of a power law temperature dependence of the thermodynamic observables in low temperatures and the weakening of the second order transition at the critical temperature. The third is the appearance of the nondiagonal elements in the static spin susceptibility. 
0808.02901	Dynamical SUSY and R-symmetry breaking in SQCD with massive and massless flavors	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Amit Giveon, Andrey Katz, Zohar Komargodski, David Shih	Abstract:  We show that supersymmetry and R-symmetry can be dynamically broken in a long-lived metastable vacuum of SQCD with massive and massless flavors. The vacuum results from a competition of a (leading) two-loop effect and small "Planck" suppressed higher-dimension operators. This mechanism provides a particularly simple realization of dynamical SUSY and R-symmetry breaking, and as such it is a good starting point for building phenomenologically viable models of gauge mediation. We take a preliminary step in this direction by constructing a complete model of minimal gauge mediation. Here we find that the parameters of the model are surprisingly constrained by the hidden sector. Similar mechanisms for creating long-lived states operate in a large class of models. 
0808.02902	A Short History of Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Subjective Recollections from Incomplete Data	Computation (stat.CO)	Authors:Christian Robert, George Casella	Abstract:  We attempt to trace the history and development of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) from its early inception in the late 1940s through its use today. We see how the earlier stages of Monte Carlo (MC, not MCMC) research have led to the algorithms currently in use. More importantly, we see how the development of this methodology has not only changed our solutions to problems, but has changed the way we think about problems. 
0808.02903	Fermi surfaces of single layer dielectrics on transition metals	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:T. Greber, M. Corso, J. Osterwalder	Abstract:  Single sheets of hexagonal boron nitride on transition metals provide a model system for single layer dielectrics. The progress in the understanding of h-BN layers on transition metals of the last 10 years are shortly reviewed. Particular emphasis lies on the boron nitride nanomesh on Rh(111), which is a corrugated single sheet of h-BN, where the corrugation imposes strong lateral electric fields. Fermi surface maps of h-BN/Rh(111) and Rh(111) are compared. A h-BN layer on Rh(111) introduces no new bands at the Fermi energy, which is expected for an insulator. The lateral electric fields of h-BN nanomesh violate the conservation law for parallel momentum in photoemission and smear out the momentum distribution curves on the Fermi surface. 
0808.02904	Investigation of the Zipf-plot of the extinct Meroitic language	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	Authors:Reginald D. Smith	Abstract:  The ancient and extinct language Meroitic is investigated using Zipf's Law. In particular, since Meroitic is still undeciphered, the Zipf law analysis allows us to assess the quality of current texts and possible avenues for future investigation using statistical techniques. 
0808.02905	Statistical electron excitation in a double quantum dot induced by two independent quantum point contacts	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:U. Gasser, S. Gustavsson, B. Küng, K. Ensslin, T. Ihn, D.C. Driscoll, A.C. Gossard	Abstract:  We investigate experimentally the influence of current flow through two independent quantum point contacts to a nearby double quantum dot realized in a GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructure. The observed current through the double quantum dot can be explained in terms of coupling to a bosonic bath. The temperature of the bath depends on the power generated by the current flow through the quantum point contact. We identify the dominant absorption and emission mechanisms in a double quantum dot as an interaction with acoustic phonons. The experiment excludes coupling of a double quantum dot to shot noise generated by quantum point contact as the dominant mechanism. 
0808.02906	Enhanced quantum entanglement in the non-Markovian dynamics of biomolecular excitons	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Michael Thorwart, Jens Eckel, John H. Reina, Peter Nalbach, Stephan Weiss	Abstract:  We show that quantum coherence of biomolecular excitons is maintained over exceedingly long times due to the constructive role of their non-Markovian protein-solvent environment. Using a numerically exact approach, we demonstrate that a slow quantum bath helps to sustain quantum entanglement of two pairs of Forster coupled excitons, in contrast to a Markovian environment. We consider the crossover from a fast to a slow bath and from weak to strong dissipation and show that a slow bath can generate robust entanglement. This persists to surprisingly high temperatures, even higher than the excitonic gap and is absent for a Markovian bath. 
0808.02907	On the largest component of a random graph with a subpower-law degree sequence in a subcritical phase	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:B. G. Pittel	Abstract:  A uniformly random graph on $n$ vertices with a fixed degree sequence, obeying a $γ$ subpower law, is studied. It is shown that, for $γ>3$, in a subcritical phase with high probability the largest component size does not exceed $n^{1/γ+\varepsilon_n}$, $\varepsilon_n=O(\ln\ln n/\ln n)$, $1/γ$ being the best power for this random graph. This is similar to the best possible $n^{1/(γ-1)}$ bound for a different model of the random graph, one with independent vertex degrees, conjectured by Durrett, and proved recently by Janson. 
0808.02908	Polarization Properties of Single Quantum Dots in Nanowires	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:M.H.M. van Weert, N. Akopian, F. Kelkensberg, U. Perinetti, M.P. van Kouwen, J. Gómez Rivas, M.T. Borgström, R.E. Algra, M.A. Verheijen, E.P.A.M. Bakkers, L.P. Kouwenhoven, V. Zwiller	Abstract:  We study the absorption and emission polarization of single semiconductor quantum dots in semiconductor nanowires. We show that the polarization of light absorbed or emitted by a nanowire quantum dot strongly depends on the orientation of the nanowire with respect to the directions along which light is incident or emitted. Light is preferentially linearly polarized when directed perpendicular to the nanowire elongation. In contrast, the degree of linear polarization is low for light directed along the nanowire. This result is vital for photonic applications based on intrinsic properties of quantum dots, such as generation of entangled photons. As an example, we demonstrate optical access to the spin states of a single nanowire quantum dot. 
0808.02909	Non-Gaussian Correlations Outside the Horizon	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Steven Weinberg	Abstract:  It is shown that under essentially all conditions, the non-linear classical equations governing gravitation and matter in cosmology have a solution in which far outside the horizon in a suitable gauge the reduced spatial metric (the spatial metric divided by the square of the Robertson--Walker scale factor $a$) is time-independent, though with an arbitrary dependence on co-moving coordinates, and all perturbations to the other metric components and to all matter variables vanish, to leading order in $1/a$. The corrections are of order $1/a^2$, and are explicitly given for the reduced metric in a multifield model with a general potential. Further, this is the solution that describes the metric and matter produced by single-field inflation. These results justify the use of observed non-Gaussian correlations (or their absence) as a test of theories of single-field inflation, despite our ignorance of the constituents of the universe while fluctuations are outside the horizon after inflation, as long as graphs with loops can be neglected. 
0808.02910	The density of integral points on hypersurfaces of degree at least four	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Oscar Marmon	Abstract:  Let $f$ be a polynomial of degree at least four with integer-valued coefficients. We establish new bounds for the density of integer solutions to the equation $f=0$, using an iterated version of Heath-Browns $q$-analogue of van der Corput's method of exponential sums. 
0808.02911	Meissner effect in superconducting microtraps	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:D. Cano, B. Kasch, H. Hattermann, R. Kleiner, C. Zimmermann, D. Koelle, J. Fortágh	Abstract:  We report on the realization and characterization of a magnetic microtrap for ultra cold atoms near a straight superconducting Nb wire with circular cross section. The trapped atoms are used to probe the magnetic field outside the superconducting wire. The Meissner effect shortens the distance between the trap and the wire, reduces the radial magnetic-field gradients and lowers the trap depth. Measurements of the trap position reveal a complete exclusion of the magnetic field from the superconducting wire for temperatures lower than 6K. As the temperature is further increased, the magnetic field partially penetrates the superconducting wire; hence the microtrap position is shifted towards the position expected for a normal-conducting wire. 
0808.02912	Preparation of the oxypnictides and studies on their superconductivity	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Ayaka Kawabata, Sang Chul Lee, Taketo Moyoshi, Yoshiaki Kobayashi, Masatoshi Sato	Abstract:  LaFe1-yCoyAsO1-xFx (x=0.11) with various y values were prepared and their electrical resistivities, superconducting diamagnetisms and Hall coefficients have been measured. 75As- and 135La-NMR studies have also been carried out In spite of the successful Co-doping, we have not found any meaningful correlation of Tc with y, which indicates that the Tc-suppression by Co-doping is considered not to be so significant as expected for superconductors with nodes. Even for superconductors without nodes, it may not be easy to expect this small effect on Tc, if there are two different (disconnected) Fermi surfaces whose order parameters have opposite signs. The data of the NMR Knight shift indicate that the Cooper pairs are in the singlet state and the spin susceptibility is almost fully suppressed at low temperature. 
0808.02913	Theory of Electron Spin Relaxation in ZnO	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:N.J. Harmon, W.O. Putikka, R. Joynt	Abstract:  Doped ZnO is a promising material for spintronics applications. For such applications, it is important to understand the spin dynamics and particularly the spin coherence of this II-VI semiconductor. The spin lifetime $τ_{s}$ has been measured by optical orientation experiments, and it shows a surprising non-monotonic behavior with temperature. We explain this behavior by invoking spin exchange between localized and extended states. Interestingly, the effects of spin-orbit coupling are by no means negligible, in spite of the relatively small valence band splitting. This is due to the wurtzite crystal structure of ZnO. Detailed analysis allows us to characterize the impurity binding energies and densities, showing that optical orientation experiments can be used as a characterization tool for semiconductor samples. 
0808.02914	Electrons and holes in Si quantum well: a room-temperature transport and drag resistance study	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:M. Prunnila, S. J. Laakso, J. M. Kivioja, J. Ahopelto	Abstract:  We investigate carrier transport in a single 22 nm-thick double-gated Si quantum well device, which has independent contacts to electrons and holes. Conductance, Hall density and Hall mobility are mapped in a broad double-gate voltage window. When the gate voltage asymmetry is not too large only either electrons or holes occupy the Si well and the Hall mobility shows the fingerprints of volume inversion/accumulation. At strongly asymmetric double-gate voltage an electric field induced electron-hole (EH) bi-layer is formed inside the well. The EH drag resistance R_{he} is explored at balanced carrier densities: R_{he} decreases monotonically from 860 to 37 Ohms when the electron and hole density is varied between ~0.4-1.7x10^{16} m^{-2}. 
0808.02915	Quantitative Verification of Ab Initio Self-consistent Laser Theory	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Li Ge, Robert J. Tandy, A. Douglas Stone, Hakan E. Türeci	Abstract:  We generalize and test the recent "ab initio" self-consistent (AISC) time-independent semiclassical laser theory. This self-consistent formalism generates all the stationary lasing properties in the multimode regime (frequencies, thresholds, internal and external fields, output power and emission pattern) from simple inputs: the dielectric function of the passive cavity, the atomic transition frequency, and the transverse relaxation time of the lasing transition. We find that the theory gives excellent quantitative agreement with full time-dependent simulations of the Maxwell-Bloch equations after it has been generalized to drop the slowly-varying envelope approximation. The theory is infinite order in the non-linear hole-burning interaction; the widely used third order approximation is shown to fail badly. 
0808.02916	Magnetic ordering in the static intermediate-valent cerium compound Ce2RuZn4	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Volker Eyert, Ernst-Wilhelm Scheidt, Wolfgang Scherer, Wilfried Hermes, Rainer Poettgen	Abstract:  The low-temperature behavior of Ce2RuZn4 has been investigated. Specific heat and magnetic susceptibility data reveal an antiferromagnetic transition at a Neel temperature of 2 K. Ce2RuZn4 is a static intermediate-valent compound with two crystallographically independent cerium atoms. The magnetic data clearly show that only one cerium site is magnetic (Ce^3+), while the second one carries no magnetic moment. The experimental data are interpreted with the help of first principles electronic structure calculations using density functional theory and the augmented spherical wave method. The calculations reveal the occurrence of two different cerium sites, which are characterized by strongly localized magneticmoments and strong Ce-Ru bonding, respectively. 
0808.02917	Low-Mass and Metal-Poor Gamma-Ray Burst Host Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Sandra Savaglio (Max-Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics)    	Abstract:  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are cosmologically distributed, very energetic and very transient sources detected in the gamma-ray domain. The identification of their x-ray and optical afterglows allowed so far the redshift measurement of 150 events, from z = 0.01 to z = 6.29. For about half of them, we have some knowledge of the properties of the parent galaxy. At high redshift (z > 2), absorption lines in the afterglow spectra give information on the cold interstellar medium in the host. At low redshift (z < 1.0) multi-band optical-NIR photometry and integrated spectroscopy reveal the GRB host general properties. A redshift evolution of metallicity is not noticeable in the whole sample. The typical value is a few times lower than solar. The mean host stellar mass is similar to that of the Large Magellanic Cloud, but the mean star formation rate is five times higher. GRBs are discovered with gamma-ray, not optical or NIR, instruments. Their hosts do not suffer from the same selection biases of typical galaxy surveys. Therefore, they might represent a fair sample of the most common galaxies that existed in the past history of the universe, and can be used to better understand galaxy formation and evolution. 
0808.02918	D-brane instantons and the effective field theory of flux compactifications	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Angel M. Uranga	Abstract:  We provide a description of the effects of fluxes on euclidean D-brane instantons purely in terms of the 4d effective action. The effect corresponds to the dressing of the effective non-perturbative 4d effective vertex with 4d flux superpotential interactions, generated when the moduli fields made massive by the flux are integrated out. The description in terms of effective field theory allows a unified description of non-perturbative effects in all flux compactifications of a given underlying fluxless model, globally in the moduli space of the latter. It also allows us to describe explicitly the effects on D-brane instantons of fluxes with no microscopic description, like non-geometric fluxes. At the more formal level, the description has interesting connections with the bulk-boundary map of open-closed two-dimensional topological string theory, and with the $\NN=1$ special geometry. 
0808.02919	Universality check of the overlap fermions in the Schroedinger functional	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Shinji Takeda	Abstract:  I examine some properties of the overlap operator in the Schroedinger functional formulated by Luescher at perturbative level. By investigating spectra of the free operator and one-loop coefficient of the Schroedinger functional coupling, I confirm the universality at tree and one-loop level. Furthermore, I address cutoff effects of the step scaling function and it turns out that the lattice artifacts for the overlap operator are comparable with those of the clover actions. 
0808.02920	The investigation of EPR paramagnetic probe line width and shape temperature dependence in high-temperature superconductors of Bi-Pb-Sr-Ca-Cu-O system	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:J.G.Chigvinadze, J.V.Acrivos, I.G.Akhvlediani, M.I.Chubabria, T.L.Kalabegishvili, T.I.Sanadze	Abstract:  The work is related with the finding out of magnetic phases in strongly anisotropic high-temperature superconductor Bi1,7Pb0,3Sr2Ca2Cu3O10-d in the temperature region where the superconductor is in the normal state. It was studied the temperature dependence of the paramagnetic probe EPR line width. In the normal state at T>Tc near 175 K it was revealed a pick in the temperature dependence of line width. In this region it was observed the time increase of the line width with the characteristic time ~ 17 min. This shows the possibility of magnetic phase formation in this material. 
0808.02921	Valence Quark Polarization In the Nucleon And the Deuteron Data	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Firooz Arash, Fatemeh Taghavi-Shahri	Abstract:  Within the framework of the so-called "valon" model, we argue that a substantial part of the nucleon spin, about 40%, is carried by the polarized valence quarks. The remaining is the result of cancellations between gluon polarization and the orbital angular momentum, where the gluon polarization is the dominant one. It is shown that the sea quark contribution to the spin of any hadron is simply marginal and consistent with zero. Our findings point to a substantially smaller value for a_8 thaninferred from hyperon- $β$ decay, suggesting that fullSU(3) symmetric assumption needs to be reconsidered. New and emerging experimental data tend to support this finding. Finally, we show that within the model described here the experimental data on the polarized structure functions $g_{1}^{p,n,d}$ are reproduced. 
0808.02922	Effects of food web construction by evolution or immigration	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:Craig R. Powell, Alan J. McKane	Abstract:  We present results contrasting food webs constructed using the same model where the source of species was either evolution or immigration from a previously evolved species pool. The overall structure of the webs are remarkably similar, although we find some important differences which mainly relate to the percentage of basal and top species. Food webs assembled from evolved webs also show distinct plateaux in the number of tropic levels as the resources available to system increase, in contrast to evolved webs. By equating the resources available to basal species to area, we are able to examine the species-area curve created by each process separately. They are found to correspond to different regimes of the tri-phasic species-area curve. 
0808.02923	The Knight of the Quantum: On the Contribution of D.I. Blokhintsev to Quantum Physics	History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)	Authors:A.L. Kuzemsky	Abstract:  A concise survey of the contribution of D.I. Blokhintsev to the quantum physics, including solid state physics, physics of metals, surface physics, statistical physics and optics is given. These achievements have been considered in the context of modern development of these fields of physics. 
0808.02924	Analyzing capacitance-voltage measurements of vertical wrapped-gated nanowires	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:O. Karlström, A. Wacker, K. Nilsson, G. Astromskas, S. Roddaro, L. Samuelson, L.-E. Wernersson	Abstract:  The capacitance of arrays of vertical wrapped-gate InAs nanowires are analyzed. With the help of a Poisson-Schr"odinger solver, information about the doping density can be obtained directly. Further features in the measured capacitance-voltage characteristics can be attributed to the presence of surface states as well as the coexistence of electrons and holes in the wire. For both scenarios, quantitative estimates are provided. It is furthermore shown that the difference between the actual capacitance and the geometrical limit is quite large, and depends strongly on the nanowire material. 
0808.02925	First Measurement of the J/psi Azimuthal Anisotropy in PHENIX at Forward Rapidity in Au+Au Collisions at sqrt s(NN) = 200 GeV	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:Catherine Silvestre, for the PHENIX Collaboration	Abstract:  The PHENIX experiment has shown that J/psis are suppressed in central Au+Au collisions at a center of mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision sqrt s(NN) = 200 GeV, and that the suppression is larger at forward than at mid-rapidity. Part of this difference may be explained by cold nuclear matter effects but the most central collisions suggest that regeneration mechanisms could be at play. In 2007, PHENIX collected almost four times more Au+Au collisions at this energy than used for previous published results. Moreover, the addition of a new reaction plane detector allows a much better analysis of the J/psi behavior in the azimuthal plane. Since a large elliptic flow has been measured for open charm, measuring J/psi azimuthal anisotropies may give a hint if J/psi are recombined in the expanding matter. First PHENIX results of J/psi elliptic flow as a function of transverse momentum at forward rapidity are presented in this article. The analysis is detailed and results are compared to mid-rapidity PHENIX preliminary results as well as to predictions. 
0808.02926	Relation between Fresnel transform of input light field and Radon transform of Wigner function of the field	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Hong-yi Fan, Li-yun Hu	Abstract:  We prove a new theorem about the relationship between optical field Wigner function's Radon transform and optical Fresnel transform of the field, i.e., when an input field Phi(x') propagates through an optical [D(-B)(-C)A] system, the energy density of the output field is equal to the Radon transform of the Wigner function of the input field, where the Radon transform parameters are D,B. We prove this theorem in both spatial-domain and frequency-domain. 
0808.02927	On the role of pressure anisotropy for relativistic stars admitting conformal motion	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Farook Rahaman, Mubasher Jamil, Mehedi Kalam, Kaushik Chakraborty, Ashis Ghosh	Abstract:  We investigate the spacetime of anisotropic stars admitting conformal motion. The Einstein field equations are solved using different ansatz of the surface tension. In this investigation, we study two cases in details with the anisotropy as: [1] $p_t = n p_r$ [2] $p_t - p_r = \frac{1}{8 π}(\frac{c_1}{r^2} + c_2)$ where, n, $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary constants. The solutions yield expressions of the physical quantities like pressure gradients and the mass. 
0808.02928	Scaling and Universality in Models of Step Bunching: The "C+-C-" Model	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Vesselin Tonchev, Bogdan Ranguelov, Hiroo Omi, Alberto Pimpinelli	Abstract:  We study further the recently introduced [Ranguelov et al., Comptes Rendus de l'Acad. Bulg. des Sci. 60, 4 (2007) 389] "C+-C-" model of step flow crystal growth over wide range of model parameters. The basic assumption of the model is that the reference ("equilibrium") densities used to compute the supersaturation might be different on either side of a step. We obtain the condition for linear stability of the whole step train in the form CL/CR>1 (L/R stands for left/right in a descending from left to right step train). Further we integrate numerically the equations of step motion to monitor the bunching process in the long times limit. Thus we obtain the exact size- and time- scaling of the step bunches including the numerical prefactors. We show that in a broad range of parameters the morphology is characterized with appearance of the minimal interstep distance in the bunch in the beginning of the bunches (at the trailing edge of the bunch) and may be described by a single universality class, different from those already generated by continuum theories [Krug et al., PRB 71, 045412]. 
0808.02929	In medium T-matrix for nuclear matter with three-body forces - binding energy and single particle properties	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:V. Soma, P. Bozek	Abstract:  We present spectral calculations of nuclear matter properties including three-body forces. Within the in-medium T-matrix approach, implemented with the CD-Bonn and Nijmegen potentials plus the three-nucleon Urbana interaction, we compute the energy per particle in symmetric and neutron matter. The three-body forces are included via an effective density dependent two-body force in the in-medium T-matrix equations. After fine tuning the parameters of the three-body force to reproduce the phenomenological saturation point in symmetric nuclear matter, we calculate the incompressibility and the energy per particle in neutron matter. We find a soft equation of state in symmetric nuclear matter but a relatively large value of the symmetry energy. We study the the influence of the three-body forces on the single-particle properties. For symmetric matter the spectral function is broadened at all momenta and all densities, while an opposite effect is found for the case of neutrons only. Noticeable modification of the spectral functions are realized only for densities above the saturation density. The modifications of the self-energy and the effective mass are not very large and appear to be strongly suppressed above the Fermi momentum. 
0808.02930	Chaos in a one-dimensional integrable quantum system	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Petr Seba, Daniel Vasata	Abstract:  We study a simple one-dimensional quantum system on a circle with n scale free point interactions. The spectrum of this system is discrete and expressible as a solution of an explicit secular equation. However, its statistical properties are nontrivial. The level spacing distribution between its neighboring odd and even levels displays a surprising agreement with the prediction obtained for the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of random matrices. 
0808.02931	Spatial planning with constraints on translational distances between geometric objects	Computational Geometry (cs.CG)	Authors:Gennady Pustylnik	Abstract:  The main constraint on relative position of geometric objects, used in spatial planning for computing the C-space maps (for example, in robotics, CAD, and packaging), is the relative non-overlapping of objects. This is the simplest constraint in which the minimum translational distance between objects is greater than zero, or more generally, than some positive value. We present a technique, based on the Minkowski operations, for generating the translational C-space maps for spatial planning with more general and more complex constraints on the relative position of geometric objects, such as constraints on various types (not only on the minimum) of the translational distances between objects. The developed technique can also be used, respectively, for spatial planning with constraints on translational distances in a given direction, and rotational distances between geometric objects, as well as for spatial planning with given dynamic geometric situation of moving objects. 
0808.02932	Krull dimension of solvable groups	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:A. Myasnikov, N. Romanovskiy	Abstract:  In this paper we prove that free solvable groups have finite Krull dimension. In fact, this is true for much wider class of solvable groups, termed rigid groups. Along the way we study the algebraic structure of the limit solvable groups (fully residually free solvable groups). 
0808.02933	Rare decay $π^{0}\to e^+ e^-$ constraints on the light CP-odd Higgs in NMSSM	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Qin Chang, Ya-Dong Yang	Abstract:  We constrain the light CP-odd Higgs $A_{1}^{0}$ in NMSSM via the rare decay $π^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}$. It is shown that the possible $3σ$ discrepancy between theoretical predictions and the recent KTeV measurement of ${\cal B}(π^{0}\to e^+ e^-)$ cannot be resolved when the constraints from $Υ\toγA_1^0$, $a_μ$ and $π^{0}\to γγ$ are combined. Furthermore, the combined constraints also exclude the scenario involving $m_{A_1^0}=214.3$ MeV, which is invoked to explain the anomaly in the $Σ^{+}\to p μ^{+}μ^{-}$ decay found by the HyperCP Collaboration. 
0808.02934	Supersymmetry Searches at the LHC	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Oleg Brandt	Abstract:  The search for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics is one of the major tasks of the LHC, CERN. In these proceedings, I review the status of searches for Supersymmetry by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. The efforts in both the hadronic and leptonic search channels are presented. A special focus is placed on the treatment of approximately one inverse femtobarn of early LHC data, and examples of background estimation techniques in such a dataset are given. Phenomenologically, besides "typical" mSUGRA scenarios, signatures based on prompt and non-pointing photons, as well as long-lived leptons and hadrons (R-hadrons) are covered. 
0808.02935	Proton-Proton Physics with ALICE	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:J. F. Grosse-Oetringhaus	Abstract:  The goal of the ALICE experiment at LHC is to study strongly interacting matter at high energy densities as well as the signatures and properties of the quark-gluon plasma. This goal manifests itself in a rich physics program. Although ALICE will mainly study heavy-ion collisions, a dedicated program will concentrate on proton-proton physics. The first part will introduce the ALICE experiment from a pp measurement's point of view. Two unique properties are its low pT cut-off and the excellent PID capabilities. The various topics of the proton-proton physics program, which will allow a close scrutiny of existing theoretical models, will be described. Furthermore, the interpretation of measurements of heavy-ion collisions necessitates the comparison to measurements of pp collisions. The second part will concentrate on the day-1 physics program of ALICE. At startup, neither the LHC luminosity nor its energy will have their nominal values. Furthermore, the ALICE detector is in the process of being aligned and calibrated. Still several physics topics can be studied from the very beginning. These will be presented as well as the effort that is already ongoing to be ready for the first collision. The statistics needed for each of the topics will be given with respect to the foreseen LHC startup scenario. 
0808.02936	Bouncing trimer: a random self-propelled particle, chaos and periodical motions	Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)	Authors:S. Dorbolo, F. Ludewig, N. Vandewalle	Abstract:  A trimer is an object composed of three centimetrical stainless steel beads equally distant and is predestined to show richer behaviours than the bouncing ball or the bouncing dimer. The rigid trimer has been placed on a plate of a electromagnetic shaker and has been vertically vibrated according to a sinusoidal signal. The horizontal translational and rotational motions of the trimer have been recorded for a range of frequencies between 25 and 100 Hz while the amplitude of the forcing vibration was tuned for obtaining maximal acceleration of the plate up to 10 times the gravity. Several modes have been detected like e.g. rotational and pure translational motions. These modes are found at determined accelerations of the plate and do not depend on the frequency. By recording the time delays between two successive contacts when the frequency and the amplitude are fixed, a mapping of the bouncing regime has been constructed and compared to that of the dimer and the bouncing ball. Period-2 and period-3 orbits have been experimentally observed. In these modes, according to observations, the contact between the trimer and the plate is persistent between two successive jumps. This persistence erases the memory of the jump preceding the contact. A model is proposed and allows to explain the values of the particular accelerations for which period-2 and period-3 modes are observed. Finally, numerical simulations allow to reproduce the experimental results. That allows to conclude that the friction between the beads and the plate is the major dissipative process. 
0808.02937	Assessing potential cluster Cepheids from a new distance and reddening parameterization and 2MASS photometry	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Daniel J. Majaess, David G. Turner, David J. Lane	Abstract:  A framework is outlined to assess Cepheids as potential cluster members from readily available photometric observations. A relationship is derived to estimate colour excess and distance for individual Cepheids through a calibration involving recently published HST parallaxes and a cleaned sample of established cluster Cepheids. Photometric (V-J) colour is found to be a viable parameter for approximating a Cepheid's reddening. The non-universal nature of the slope of the Cepheid PL relation for BV photometry is confirmed. By comparison, the slopes of the VJ and VI relations seem relatively unaffected by metallicity. A new Galactic Cepheid confirmed here, GSC 03729-01127 (F6-G1 Ib), is sufficiently coincident with the coronal regions of Tombaugh 5 to warrant follow-up radial velocity measures to assess membership. CCD photometry and O--C diagrams are presented for GSC 03729-01127 and the suspected cluster Cepheids AB Cam and BD Cas. Fourier analysis of the photometry for BD Cas and recent estimates of its metallicity constrain it to be a Population I overtone pulsator rather than a Type II s-Cepheid. AB Cam and BD Cas are not physically associated with the spatially-adjacent open clusters Tombaugh 5 and King 13, respectively, the latter being much older (log t ~ 9) than believed previously. Rates of period change are determined for the three Cepheids from archival and published data. GSC 03729-01127 and AB Cam exhibit period increases, implying fifth and third crossings of the instability strip, respectively, while BD Cas exhibits a period decrease, indicating a second crossing, with possible superposed trends unrelated to binarity. More importantly, the observed rates of period change confirm theoretical predictions. The challenges and prospects for future work in this area of research are discussed. 
0808.02938	Locally undetermined states, generalized Schmidt decomposition, and an application in distributed computing	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Yuan Feng, Runyao Duan, Mingsheng Ying	Abstract:  Multipartite quantum states that cannot be uniquely determined by their reduced states of all proper subsets of the parties exhibit some inherit `high-order' correlation. This paper elaborates this issue by giving necessary and sufficient conditions for a pure multipartite state to be locally undetermined, and moreover, characterizing precisely all the pure states sharing the same set of reduced states with it. Interestingly, local determinability of pure states is closely related to a generalized notion of Schmidt decomposition. Furthermore, we find that locally undetermined states have some applications to the well-known consensus problem in distributed computation. To be specific, given some physically separated agents, when communication between them, either classical or quantum, is unreliable and they are not allowed to use local ancillary quantum systems, then there exists a totally correct and completely fault-tolerant protocol for them to reach a consensus if and only if they share a priori a locally undetermined quantum state. 
0808.02939	Algorithmic derivation of Dyson-Schwinger Equations	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Reinhard Alkofer, Markus Q. Huber, Kai Schwenzer	Abstract:  We present an algorithm for the derivation of Dyson-Schwinger equations of general theories that is suitable for an implementation within a symbolic programming language. Moreover, we introduce the Mathematica package DoDSE which provides such an implementation. It derives the Dyson-Schwinger equations graphically once the interactions of the theory are specified. A few examples for the application of both the algorithm and the DoDSE package are provided. The package can be obtained from physik.uni-graz.at/~mah/DoDSE.html. 
0808.02940	A New Kind of Weak-Coupling in Top-Quark Physics ?	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Charles A. Nelson	Abstract:  In the standard model, for the t --> W b decay mode, the relative phase is 0-degrees between the dominant A(0,-1/2) and A(-1, -1/2) helicity amplitudes. However, in the case of an additional large t_R --> b_L chiral weak-transition moment, there is instead a 180-degree relative phase and three theoretical numerical puzzles. This phase can be measured at the Tevatron or LHC in top-antitop pair production by use of W-boson longitudinal-transverse interference in beam-referenced stage-two spin-correlation functions. Indeed, this is a new type of weak-coupling for it is directly associated with E_W, the W-boson energy in the top quark rest frame, instead of with a canonical effective mass scale. For most 2 --> 2 reactions, the simple off-shell continuation of this additional coupling is found to have good high energy properties, i.e. it does not destroy 1-loop unitarity of the SM. In a subset of processes, additional third-generation couplings are required. 
0808.02941	Fully Gapped Superconducting State Based on a High Normal State Quasiparticle Density of States in Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ Single Crystals	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Gang Mu, Huiqian Luo, Zhaosheng Wang, Lei Shan, Cong Ren, Hai-Hu Wen	Abstract:  We report the specific heat (SH) measurements on single crystals of hole doped $FeAs$-based superconductor $Ba_{0.6}K_{0.4}Fe_2As_2$. It is found that the electronic SH coefficient $γ_e(T)$ is not temperature dependent and increases almost linearly with the magnetic field in low temperature region. These point to a fully gapped superconducting state. Surprisingly the sharp SH anomaly $ΔC/T|_{T_c}$ reaches a value of 98 $mJ/mol K^2$ suggesting a very high normal state quasiparticle density of states ($γ_n \approx 63 mJ/mol K^2$). A detailed analysis reveals that the $γ_e(T)$ cannot be fitted with a single gap of s-wave symmetry due to the presence of a hump in the middle temperature region. However, our data indicate that the dominant part of the superconducting condensate is induced by an s-wave gap with the magnitude of about 6 meV. 
0808.02942	Morita Equivalence of Brandt Semigroup Algebras	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Maysam Maysami	Abstract:  We prove that for every group $G$ and any two sets $I,J$, the Brandt semigroup algebras $\ell(B(I,G))$ and $\ell(B(J,G))$ are Morita equivalent with respect to the Morita theory of self-induced Banach algebras introduced by Gronbaek. As applications, we show that if $G$ is an amenable group, then for a wide class of Banach $\ell(B(I,G))$-bimodules $E$, and every $n>0$, the bounded Hochschild cohomology groups $H^n(\ell(B(I,G)),E^*)$ are trivial, and also, the notion of approximate amenability is not Morita invariant. 
0808.02943	A binary tree representation for the 2-adic valuation of a sequence arising from a rational integral	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Xinyu Sun, Victor H. Moll	Abstract:  We present a binary tree that describes the 2-adic valuation of a sequence of coefficients arising from the evaluation of a rational integral. 
0808.02944	Parseval frames for ICC groups	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Dorin Ervin Dutkay, Deguang Han, Gabriel Picioroaga	Abstract:  We analyze Parseval frames generated by the action of an ICC group on a Hilbert space. We parametrize the set of all such Parseval frames by operators in the commutant of the corresponding representation. We characterize when two such frames are strongly disjoint. We prove an undersampling result showing that if the representation has a Parseval frame of norm $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$, the Hilbert space is spanned by an orthonormal basis generated by a subgroup. As applications we obtain some sufficient conditions under which a unitary representation admits a Parseval frame which is spanned by an Riesz sequences generated by a subgroup. In particular, every subrepresentation of the left regular representation of a free group has this property. 
0808.02945	Density and Correlation functions of vortex and saddle points in open billiard systems	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:R. Höhmann, U. Kuhl, H.-J. Stöckmann, J. D. Urbina, M. Dennis	Abstract:  We present microwave measurements for the density and spatial correlation of current critical points in an open billiard system, and compare them with the predictions of the Random Wave Model (RWM). In particular, due to a novel improvement of the experimental set-up, we determine experimentally the spatial correlation of saddle points of the current field. An asymptotic expression for the vortex-saddle and saddle-saddle correlation functions based on the RWM is derived, with experiment and theory agreeing well. We also derive an expression for the density of saddle points in the presence of a straight boundary with general mixed boundary conditions in the RWM, and compare with experimental measurements of the vortex and saddle density in the vicinity of a straight wall satisfying Dirichlet conditions. 
0808.02946	Probability and Fourier duality for affine iterated function systems	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Dorin Ervin Dutkay, Palle Jorgensen	Abstract:  Let $d$ be a positive integer, and let $μ$ be a finite measure on $\br^d$. In this paper we ask when it is possible to find a subset $Λ$ in $\br^d$ such that the corresponding complex exponential functions $e_λ$ indexed by $Λ$ are orthogonal and total in $L^2(μ)$. If this happens, we say that $(μ, Λ)$ is a spectral pair. This is a Fourier duality, and the $x$-variable for the $L^2(μ)$-functions is one side in the duality, while the points in $Λ$ is the other. Stated this way, the framework is too wide, and we shall restrict attention to measures $μ$ which come with an intrinsic scaling symmetry built in and specified by a finite and prescribed system of contractive affine mappings in $\br^d$; an affine iterated function system (IFS). This setting allows us to generate candidates for spectral pairs in such a way that the sets on both sides of the Fourier duality are generated by suitably chosen affine IFSs. For a given affine setup, we spell out the appropriate duality conditions that the two dual IFS-systems must have. Our condition is stated in terms of certain complex Hadamard matrices. Our main results give two ways of building higher dimensional spectral pairs from combinatorial algebra and spectral theory applied to lower dimensional systems. 
0808.02947	The Frame Potential, on Average	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Ingemar Bengtsson, Helena Granstrom	Abstract:  A SIC consists of N^2 equiangular unit vectors in an N dimensional Hilbert space. The frame potential is a function of N^2 unit vectors. It has a unique global minimum if the vectors form a SIC, and this property has been made use of in numerical searches for SICs. When the vectors form an orbit of the Heisenberg group the frame potential becomes a function of a single fiducial vector. We analytically compute the average of this function over Hilbert space. We also compute averages when the fiducial vector is placed in certain special subspaces defined by the Clifford group. 
0808.02948	Exotic c c-bar Mesons	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Eric Braaten	Abstract:  A surprising number of new c c-bar mesons with masses above the D D-bar threshold have been discovered at the B factories. Some of them are ordinary charmonium states, but others are definitely exotic mesons. The current theoretical status of the new c c-bar mesons is summarized. 
0808.02949	On the Use of Group Theoretical and Graphical Techniques toward the Solution of the General N-body Problem	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:W.B. Laing, M. Dunn, D.K. Watson	Abstract:  Group theoretic and graphical techniques are used to derive the N-body wave function for a system of identical bosons with general interactions through first-order in a perturbation approach. This method is based on the maximal symmetry present at lowest order in a perturbation series in inverse spatial dimensions. The symmetric structure at lowest order has a point group isomorphic with the S_N group, the symmetric group of N particles, and the resulting perturbation expansion of the Hamiltonian is order-by-order invariant under the permutations of the S_N group. This invariance under S_N imposes severe symmetry requirements on the tensor blocks needed at each order in the perturbation series. We show here that these blocks can be decomposed into a basis of binary tensors invariant under S_N. This basis is small (25 terms at first order in the wave function), independent of N, and is derived using graphical techniques. This checks the N^6 scaling of these terms at first order by effectively separating the N scaling problem away from the rest of the physics. The transformation of each binary tensor to the final normal coordinate basis requires the derivation of Clebsch-Gordon coefficients of S_N for arbitrary N. This has been accomplished using the group theory of the symmetric group. This achievement results in an analytic solution for the wave function, exact through first order, that scales as N^0, effectively circumventing intensive numerical work. This solution can be systematically improved with further analytic work by going to yet higher orders in the perturbation series. 
0808.02950	Polynomial Bounds for Oscillation of Solutions of Fuchsian Systems	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Gal Binyamini, Sergei Yakovenko	Abstract:  We study the problem of placing effective upper bounds for the number of zeros of solutions of Fuchsian systems on the Riemann sphere. The principal result is an explicit (non-uniform) upper bound, polynomially growing on the frontier of the class of Fuchsian systems of given dimension n having m singular points. As a function of n,m, this bound turns out to be double exponential in the precise sense explained in the paper. As a corollary, we obtain a solution of the so called restricted infinitesimal Hilbert 16th problem, an explicit upper bound for the number of isolated zeros of Abelian integrals which is polynomially growing as the Hamiltonian tends to the degeneracy locus. This improves the exponential bounds recently established by A. Glutsyuk and Yu. Ilyashenko.

The PBW basis property is established. An algebra isomorphism relating tDaHCa to tsDaHa is obtained. 
0808.02952	On the Number of Zeros of Abelian Integrals: A Constructive Solution of the Infinitesimal Hilbert Sixteenth Problem	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Gal Binyamini, Dmitry Novikov, Sergei Yakovenko	Abstract:  We prove that the number of limit cycles generated by a small non-conservative perturbation of a Hamiltonian polynomial vector field on the plane, is bounded by a double exponential of the degree of the fields. This solves the long-standing tangential Hilbert 16th problem. The proof uses only the fact that Abelian integrals of a given degree are horizontal sections of a regular flat meromorphic connection (Gauss-Manin connection) with a quasiunipotent monodromy group. 
0808.02953	Declarative Combinatorics: Isomorphisms, Hylomorphisms and Hereditarily Finite Data Types in Haskell	Programming Languages (cs.PL)	Authors:Paul Tarau	Abstract:  This paper is an exploration in a functional programming framework of {\em isomorphisms} between elementary data types (natural numbers, sets, multisets, finite functions, permutations binary decision diagrams, graphs, hypergraphs, parenthesis languages, dyadic rationals, primes, DNA sequences etc.) and their extension to hereditarily finite universes through {\em hylomorphisms} derived from {\em ranking/unranking} and {\em pairing/unpairing} operations. An embedded higher order {\em combinator language} provides any-to-any encodings automatically. Besides applications to experimental mathematics, a few examples of ``free algorithms'' obtained by transferring operations between data types are shown. Other applications range from stream iterators on combinatorial objects to self-delimiting codes, succinct data representations and generation of random instances. The paper covers 59 data types and, through the use of the embedded combinator language, provides 3540 distinct bijective transformations between them. The self-contained source code of the paper, as generated from a literate Haskell program, is available at \url{this http URL}. {\bf Keywords}: Haskell data representations, data type isomorphisms, declarative combinatorics, computational mathematics, Ackermann encoding, Gödel numberings, arithmetization, ranking/unranking, hereditarily finite sets, functions and permutations, encodings of binary decision diagrams, dyadic rationals, DNA encodings 
0808.02954	Gluon saturation effects on J/Psi production in heavy ion collisions	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Dmitri Kharzeev, Eugene Levin, Marzia Nardi, Kirill Tuchin	Abstract:  We consider a novel mechanism for J/Psi production in nuclear collisions arising due to the high density of gluons. We calculate the resulting J/Psi production cross section as a function of rapidity and centrality. We evaluate the nuclear modification factor and show that the rapidity distribution of the produced J/Psi's is significantly more narrow in AA collisions due to the gluon saturation effects. Our results indicate that gluon saturation in the colliding nuclei is a significant source of J/Psi suppression that can be disentangled from the quark-gluon plasma effects. 
0808.02955	Is the photon paramagnetic?	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:H. Perez Rojas, E. Rodriguez Querts	Abstract:  A photon exhibits a tiny anomalous magnetic moment $μ_γ$ due to its interaction with an external constant magnetic field in vacuum through the virtual electron-positron background. It is paramagnetic ($μ_γ>0$) in the whole region of transparency, i.e. below the first threshold energy for pair creation and has a maximum near this threshold. The photon magnetic moment is different for eigenmodes polarized along and perpendicular to the magnetic field. Explicit expressions are given for $μ_γ$ for the cases of photon energies smaller and closer to the first pair creation threshold. The region beyond the first threshold is briefly discussed. 
0808.02956	Spinor fields in Causal Set Theory	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Roman Sverdlov	Abstract:  The goal of this paper is to define fermionic fields on causal set. This is done by the use of holonomies to define vierbines, and then defining spinor fields by taking advantage of the leftover degrees of freedom of holonomies plus additional scalar fields. Grassmann nature is being enforced by allowing measure to take both positive and negative values, and also by introducing a vector space to have both commutting dot product and anticommutting wedge product.

0808.02958	Series expansion of the photon self-energy in QED and the photon anomalous magnetic moment	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:H. Perez Rojas, E. Rodriguez Querts	Abstract:  We start from the analytical expression of the eigenvalues $κ^{(i)}$ of the photon self-energy tensor in an external constant magnetic field $B$ calculated by Batalin Shabad in the Furry representation, and in the one-loop approximation. We expand in power series of the external field and in terms of the squared photon transverse momentum $z_2$ and (minus) transverse energy $z_1=k^2-z_2$, in terms of which are expressed $κ^{(i)}$. A general expression is given for the photon anomalous magnetic moment $μ_γ>0$ in the region of transparency, below the first threshold for pair creation, and it is shown that it is positive, i.e. paramagnetic. The results of the numerical calculation for $μ_γ>0$ are displayed in a region close to the threshold. 
0808.02959	A New World Sheet Field Theory	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Korkut Bardakci	Abstract:  A second quantized field theory on the world sheet is developed for summing planar graphs of the phi^3 theory. This is in contrast to the earlier work, which was based on first quantization. The ground state of the model is investigated with the help of a variational ansatz. In complete agreement with standard perturbation theory, the infinities encountered in carrying out this calculation can be eliminated by the renormalization of the parameters of the model. We also find that, as in the earlier work, in the ground state, graphs form a dense network (condensate) on the world sheet. 
0808.02960	Models of expansions of N with no end extensions	Logic (math.LO)	Authors:Saharon Shelah	Abstract:  We deal with models of Peano arithmetic (specifically with a question of Ali Enayat). The methods are from creature forcing. We find an expansion of N such that its theory has models with no (elementary) end extensions. In fact there is a Borel uncountable set of subsets of N such that expanding N by any uncountably many of them suffice. Also we find arithmetically closed A with no definably closed ultrafilter on it. 
0808.02961	Gravitational catalysis of chiral and color symmetry breaking of quark matter in hyperbolic space	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:D. Ebert, A.V. Tyukov, V.Ch. Zhukovsky	Abstract:  We study the dynamical breaking of chiral and color symmetries of dense quark matter in the ultrastatic hyperbolic spacetime $R\otimes H^3$ in the framework of an extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. On the basis of analytical expressions for chiral and color condensates as functions of curvature and temperature, the phenomenon of dimensional reduction and gravitational catalysis of symmetry breaking in strong gravitational field is demonstrated in the regime of weak coupling constants. In the case of strong couplings it is shown that curvature leads to small corrections to the flat-space values of condensate and thus enhances the symmetry breaking effects. Finally, using numerical calculations phase transitions under the influence of chemical potential and negative curvature are considered and the phase portrait of the system is constructed. 
0808.02962	Is there an Ay problem in low-energy neutron-proton scattering?	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Franz Gross, Alfred Stadler	Abstract:  We calculate Ay in neutron-proton scattering for the interactions models WJC-1 and WJC-2 in the Covariant Spectator Theory. We find that the recent 12 MeV measurements performed at TUNL are in better agreement with our results than with the Nijmegen Phase Shift Analysis of 1993, and after reviewing the low-energy data, conclude that there is no Ay problem in low-energy np scattering. 
0808.02963	A High Phase-Space-Density Gas of Polar Molecules	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:K.-K. Ni, S. Ospelkaus, M. H. G. de Miranda, A. Pe'er, B. Neyenhuis, J. J. Zirbel, S. Kotochigova, P. S. Julienne, D. S. Jin, J. Ye	Abstract:  A quantum gas of ultracold polar molecules, with long-range and anisotropic interactions, would not only enable explorations of a large class of many-body physics phenomena, but could also be used for quantum information processing. We report on the creation of an ultracold dense gas of 40K87Rb polar molecules. Using a single step of STIRAP (STImulated Raman Adiabatic Passage) via two-frequency laser irradiation, we coherently transfer extremely weakly bound KRb molecules to the rovibrational ground state of either the triplet or the singlet electronic ground molecular potential. The polar molecular gas has a peak density of 10^12 cm^-3, and an expansion-determined translational temperature of 350 nK. The polar molecules have a permanent electric dipole moment, which we measure via Stark spectroscopy to be 0.052(2) Debye for the triplet rovibrational ground state and 0.566(17) Debye for the singlet rovibrational ground state. (1 Debye= 3.336*10^-30 C m) 
0808.02964	Estimating the Lengths of Memory Words	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Gusztav Morvai, Benjamin Weiss	Abstract:  For a stationary stochastic process $\{X_n\}$ with values in some set $A$, a finite word $w \in A^K$ is called a memory word if the conditional probability of $X_0$ given the past is constant on the cylinder set defined by $X_{-K}^{-1}=w$. It is a called a minimal memory word if no proper suffix of $w$ is also a memory word. For example in a $K$-step Markov processes all words of length $K$ are memory words but not necessarily minimal. We consider the problem of determining the lengths of the longest minimal memory words and the shortest memory words of an unknown process $\{X_n\}$ based on sequentially observing the outputs of a single sample $\{ξ_1,ξ_2,...ξ_n\}$. We will give a universal estimator which converges almost surely to the length of the longest minimal memory word and show that no such universal estimator exists for the length of the shortest memory word. The alphabet $A$ may be finite or countable. 
0808.02965	On stability, fluctuations, and quantum mechanics	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Robert Carroll	Abstract:  We review a stability approach to quantization by Rusov and Vlasenko and indicate possible comparisons of fluctuations to standard situations involving a quantum potential. 
0808.02966	Interplay of complete wetting, critical adsorption, and capillary condensation	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:A. Drzewinski, A. Maciolek, A. Barasinski, S. Dietrich	Abstract:  The excess adsorption $Γ$ in two-dimensional Ising strips $(\infty \times L)$ subject to identical boundary fields, at both one-dimensional surfaces decaying in the orthogonal direction $j$ as $-h_1j^{-p}$, is studied for various values of $p$ and along various thermodynamic paths below the critical point by means of the density-matrix renormalization-group method. The crossover behavior between the complete wetting and critical adsorption regimes, occurring in semi-infinite systems, are strongly influenced by confinement effects. Along isotherms $T=const$ the asymptotic power law dependences on the external bulk field, which characterize these two regimes, are undercut by capillary condensation. Along the pseudo first-order phase coexistence line of the strips, which varies with temperature, we find a broad crossover regime where both the thickness of the wetting film and $Γ$ increase as function of the reduced temperature $τ$ but do not follow any power law. Above the wetting temperature the order parameter profiles are not slab-like but exhibit wide interfacial variations and pronounced tails. Inter alia, our explicit calculations demonstrate that, contrary to opposite claims by Kroll and Lipowsky [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 28}, 5273 (1983)], for $p=2$ critical wetting transitions do exist and we determine the corresponding wetting phase diagram in the $(h_1,T)$ plane. 
0808.02967	Continuous Bounded Cohomology of Topological Semigroups	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Maysam Maysami	Abstract:  We define a cohomology theory for topological semigroups, with seminormed cohomology groups. Our theory can be considered as a topological version of bounded cohomology of discrete semigroups. 
0808.02968	On the Hersch-Payne-Schiffer inequalities for Steklov eigenvalues	Spectral Theory (math.SP)	Authors:Alexandre Girouard, Iosif Polterovich	Abstract:  We prove that the isoperimetric inequality due to Hersch-Payne-Schiffer for the n-th nonzero Steklov eigenvalue of a bounded simply-connected planar domain is sharp for all n=1,2,... The equality is attained in the limit by a sequence of simply-connected domains degenerating to the disjoint union of n identical disks. We give a new proof of this inequality for n=2 and show that it is strict in this case. Related results are also obtained for the product of two consecutive Steklov eigenvalues. 
0808.02969	Electronic Selection Rules Controlling Dislocation Glide in bcc Metals	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Travis E. Jones, Mark E. Eberhart, Dennis P. Clougherty, Chris Woodward	Abstract:  The validity of the structure-property relationships governing the deformation behavior of bcc metals was brought into question with recent {\it ab initio} density functional studies of isolated screw dislocations in Mo and Ta. These existing relationships were semiclassical in nature, having grown from atomistic investigations of the deformation properties of the groups V and VI transition metals. We find that the correct form for these structure-property relationships is fully quantum mechanical, involving the coupling of electronic states with the strain field at the core of long $a/2<111>$ screw dislocations. 
0808.02970	Ratchet transport of interacting particles	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:A.D.Chepelianskii, M.V.Entin, L.I.Magarill, D.L.Shepelyansky	Abstract:  We study analytically and numerically the ratchet transport of interacting particles induced by a monochromatic driving in asymmetric two-dimensional structures. The ratchet flow is preserved in the limit of strong interactions and can become even stronger compared to the non-interacting case. The developed kinetic theory gives a good description of these two limiting regimes. The numerical data show emergence of turbulence in the ratchet flow under certain conditions. 
0808.02971	A Statistical Study on Solar Active Regions Producing Extremely Fast Coronal Mass Ejections	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yuming Wang, Jie Zhang	Abstract:  We present a statistical result on the properties of solar source regions that have produced 57 fastest front-side coronal mass ejections (CMEs) (speed 1500 km/s) occurred from 1996 June to 2007 January. The properties of these fast-CME-producing regions, 35 in total, are compared with those of all 1143 active regions (ARs) in the period studied. An automated method, based on SOHO/MDI magnetic synoptic charts, is used to select and characterize the ARs. For each AR, a set of parameters are derived including the areas (positive, negative and total, denoted by A_P, A_N and A_T respectively), the magnetic fluxes (positive, negative and total, F_P, F_N and F_T respectively), the average magnetic field strength (B_avg), quasi-elongation (e) characterizing the overall shape of the AR, the number and length of polarity inversion lines (PILs, or neutral lines, N_PIL and L_PIL respectively), and the average and maximum of magnetic gradient on the PILs (GOP_avg and GOP_max respectively). Our statistical analysis shows a general trend between the scales of an AR and the likelihood of producing a fast CME, i.e., the larger the geometric size (A_T), the larger the magnetic flux (F_T), the stronger the magnetic field (B_avg), and/or the more complex the magnetic configuration (N_PIL and L_PIL), then the higher the possibility of producing a fast CME. When all ARs are sorted into three equally-numbered groups with low, middle and high values of these parameters, we find that, for all these AR parameters, more than 60% of extremely fast CMEs are from the high-value group. The two PIL parameters are the best indicators of producing fast CMEs, with more than 80% from the high value group. 
0808.02972	Multistage Entanglement Swapping	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Alexander M. Goebel, Claudia Wagenknecht, Qiang Zhang, Yu-Ao Chen, Kai Chen, Joerg Schmiedmayer, Jian-Wei Pan	Abstract:  We report an experimental demonstration of entanglement swapping over two quantum stages. By successful realizations of two cascaded photonic entanglement swapping processes, entanglement is generated and distributed between two photons, that originate from independent sources and do not share any common past. In the experiment we use three pairs of polarization entangled photons and conduct two Bell-state measurements (BSMs) one between the first and second pair, and one between the second and third pair. This results in projecting the remaining two outgoing photons from pair 1 and 3 into an entangled state, as characterized by an entanglement witness. The experiment represents an important step towards a full quantum repeater where multiple entanglement swapping is a key ingredient. 
0808.02973	SMA observations of Infrared Dark Clouds: A tale of two cores	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. M. Rathborne, J. M. Jackson, Q. Zhang, R. Simon	Abstract:  We present high-angular resolution sub-millimeter continuum images and molecular line spectra obtained with the SMA toward two massive cores that lie within Infrared Dark Clouds; one actively star-forming (G034.43+00.24 MM1) and the other more quiescent (G028.53-00.25 MM1). The high-angular resolution sub-mm continuum image of G034.43+00.24 MM1 reveals a compact (~0.03 pc) and massive (~29 Msun) structure while the molecular line spectrum shows emission from numerous complex molecules. Such a rich molecular line spectrum from a compact region indicates that G034.43+00.24 MM1 contains a hot molecular core, an early stage in the formation of a high-mass protostar. Moreover, the velocity structure of its 13CO(3-2) emission indicates that this B0 protostar may be surrounded by a rotating circumstellar envelope. In contrast, the sub-mm continuum image of G028.53-00.25 MM1 reveals three compact (<0.06 pc), massive (9-21 Msun) condensations but with no lines detected in its spectrum. We suggest that the core G028.53-00.25 MM1 is in a very early stage in the high-mass star-formation process; its size and mass are sufficient to form at least one high-mass star, yet it shows no signs of localized heating. Because the combination of high velocity line wings with a large IR-mm bolometric luminosity (~100 Lsun) indicates that this core has already begun to form accreting protostars, we speculate that the condensations may be in the early phase of accretion and may eventually become high-mass protostars. We, therefore, have found the possible existence of two high-mass star-forming cores; one in a very early phase of star-formation and one in the later hot core phase. Together the properties of these two cores support the idea that the earliest stages of high-mass star-formation occur within IRDCs. 
0808.02974	Electron beam nanosculpting of suspended graphene sheets	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Michael D. Fischbein, Marija Drndic	Abstract:  We demonstrate high-resolution modification of suspended multi-layer graphene sheets by controlled exposure to the focused electron beam of a transmission electron microscope. We show that this technique can be used to realize, on timescales of a few seconds, a variety of features, including nanometer-scale pores, slits, and gaps that are stable and do not evolve over time. Despite the extreme thinness of the suspended graphene sheets, extensive removal of material to produce the desired feature geometries is found to not introduce long-range distortion of the suspended sheet structure. 
0808.02975	An Improved Technique for Measurement of Cold HI in Molecular Cloud Cores	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Marko Krco, Paul F. Goldsmith, Robert L. Brown, Di Li	Abstract:  The presence of atomic gas mixed with molecular species in a "molecular" cloud may significantly affect its chemistry, the excitation of some species, and can serve as probe of the cloud's evolution. Cold neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) in molecular clouds is revealed by its self absorption of background galactic HI 21-cm emission. The properties of this gas can be investigated quantitatively through observation of HI Narrow Self-Absorption (HINSA). In this paper, we present a new technique for measuring atomic gas physical parameters from HINSA observations that utilizes molecular tracers to guide the HINSA extraction. This technique offers a significant improvement in the precision with which HI column densities can be determined over previous methods, and it opens several new avenues of study of relevance to the field of star formation. 
0808.02976	A Comparative Study Between Eruptive X-class Flares Associated with Coronal Mass Ejections and Confined X-class Flares	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yuming Wang, Jie Zhang	Abstract:  We examine the two kinds of major energetic phenomena that occur in the solar atmosphere: eruptive and confined events. The former describes flares with associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs), while the latter denotes flares without associated CMEs. We find that about 90% of X-class flares are eruptive, but the remaining 10% are confined. To probe why the largest energy releases could be either eruptive or confined, we investigate four X-class events from each of the two types. Both sets of events are selected to have very similar intensities (X1.0 to X3.6) and duration (rise time under 13 minutes and decay time not over 9 minutes) in soft X-ray observations, to reduce any bias due to flare size on CME occurrence. We find that the occurrence of eruption (or confinement) is sensitive to the displacement of the location of the energy release, defined as the distance between the flare site and the flux-weighted magnetic center of the source active region. The displacement is 6 - 17 Mm for confined events but as large as 22 - 37 Mm for eruptive events. This means that confined events occur closer to the magnetic center, while the eruptive events tend to occur close to the edge of active regions. We use the potential field source-surface model to infer the coronal magnetic field above the source active regions and calculate the flux ratio of low (<1.1 Rs) to high (>1.1 Rs) corona. We find that the confined events have a lower ratio (<5.7) than the eruptive events (>7.1). These results imply that a stronger overlying arcade field may prevent energy releases in the low corona from being eruptive, resulting in flares, but without CMEs. 
0808.02977	On the existence of soliton and hairy black hole solutions of su(N) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory with a negative cosmological constant	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:J. E. Baxter, Elizabeth Winstanley	Abstract:  We study the existence of soliton and black hole solutions of four-dimensional su(N) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory with a negative cosmological constant. We prove the existence of non-trivial solutions for any integer N, with N-1 gauge field degrees of freedom. In particular, we prove the existence of solutions in which all the gauge field functions have no zeros. For fixed values of the parameters (at the origin or event horizon, as applicable) defining the soliton or black hole solutions, if the magnitude of the cosmological constant is sufficiently large, then the gauge field functions all have no zeros. These latter solutions are of special interest because at least some of them will be linearly stable. 
0808.02978	A Coherence-Based Approach for Tracking Waves in the Solar Corona	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Scott W. McIntosh, Bart De Pontieu, Steven Tomczyk	Abstract:  We consider the problem of automatically (and robustly) isolating and extracting information about waves and oscillations observed in EUV image sequences of the solar corona with a view to near real-time application to data from the Atmospheric Imaging Array (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We find that a simple coherence / travel-time based approach detects and provides a wealth of information on transverse and longitudinal wave phenomena in the test sequences provided by the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE). The results of the search are "pruned" (based on diagnostic errors) to minimize false-detections such that the remainder provides robust measurements of waves in the solar corona, with the calculated propagation speed allowing automated distinction between various wave modes. In this paper we discuss the technique, present results on the TRACE test sequences, and describe how our method can be used to automatically process the enormous flow of data (~1Tb/day) that will be provided by SDO/AIA after launch in late 2008. 
0808.02979	Abundance of Ground States with Positive Parity	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:T. Papenbrock, H. A. Weidenmueller	Abstract:  We investigate analytically and numerically a random-matrix model for m fermions occupying l1 single-particle states with positive parity and l2 single-particle states with negative parity and interacting through random two-body forces that conserve parity. The single-particle states are completely degenerate and carry no further quantum numbers. We compare spectra of many-body states with positive and with negative parity. We show that in the dilute limit, ground states with positive and with negative parity occur with equal probability. Differences in the ground-state probabilities are, thus, a finite-size effect and are mainly due to different dimensions of the Hilbert spaces of either parity. 
0808.02980	Strength of Coronal Mass Ejection-Driven Shocks Near the Sun, and Its Importance in Predicting Solar Energetic Particle Events	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Chenglong Shen, Yuming Wang, Pinzhong Ye, X. P. Zhao, Bin Gui, S. Wang	Abstract:  Coronal shocks are important structures, but there are no direct observations of them in solar and space physics. The strength of shocks plays a key role in shock-related phenomena, such as radio bursts and solar energetic particle (SEP) generation. This paper presents an improved method of calculating Alfven speed and shock strength near the Sun. This method is based on using as many observations as possible, rather than one-dimensional global models. Two events, a relatively slow CME on 2001 September 15 and a very fast CME on 2000 June 15, are selected to illustrate the calculation process. The calculation results suggest that the slow CME drove a strong shock, with Mach number of 3.43 - 4.18, while the fast CME drove a relatively weak shock, with Mach number of 1.90 - 3.21. This is consistent with the radio observations, which find a stronger and longer decameter-hectometric (DH) type II radio burst during the first event, and a short DH type II radio burst during the second event. In particular, the alculation results explain the observational fact that the slow CME produced a major solar energetic particle (SEP) event, while the fast CME did not. Through a comparison of the two events, the importance of shock strength in predicting SEP events is addressed. 
0808.02981	Quantifying the heart of darkness with GHALO - a multi-billion particle simulation of our galactic halo	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Joachim Stadel, Doug Potter, Ben Moore, Jürg Diemand, Piero Madau, Marcel Zemp, Michael Kuhlen, Vicent Quilis	Abstract:  We perform a series of simulations of a Galactic mass dark matter halo at different resolutions, our largest uses over three billion particles and has a mass resolution of 1000 M_sun. We quantify the structural properties of the inner dark matter distribution and study how they depend on numerical resolution. We can measure the density profile to a distance of 120 pc (0.05% of R_vir) where the logarithmic slope is -0.8 and -1.4 at (0.5% of R_vir). We propose a new two parameter fitting function that has a linearly varying logarithmic density gradient which fits the GHALO and VL2 density profiles extremely well. Convergence in the density profile and the halo shape scales as N^(-1/3), but the shape converges at a radius three times larger at which point the halo becomes more spherical due to numerical resolution. The six dimensional phase-space profile is dominated by the presence of the substructures and does not follow a power law, except in the smooth under-resolved inner few kpc. 
0808.02982	The Palomar/Keck Adaptive Optics Survey of Young Solar Analogs: Evidence for a Universal Companion Mass Function	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Stanimir Metchev (UCLA/Stony Brook), Lynne Hillenbrand (Caltech)    	Abstract:  We present results from an adaptive optics survey for substellar and stellar companions to Sun-like stars. The survey targeted 266 F5-K5 stars in the 3Myr to 3Gyr age range with distances of 10-190pc. Results from the survey include the discovery of two brown dwarf companions (HD49197B and HD203030B), 24 new stellar binaries, and a triple system. We infer that the frequency of 0.012-0.072Msun brown dwarfs in 28-1590AU orbits around young solar analogs is 3.2% (+3.1%,-2.7%; 2sigma limits). The result demonstrates that the deficiency of substellar companions at wide orbital separations from Sun-like stars is less pronounced than in the radial velocity "brown dwarf desert." We infer that the mass distribution of companions in 28-1590AU orbits around solar-mass stars follows a continuous dN/dM_2 ~ M_2^(-0.4) relation over the 0.01-1.0Msun secondary mass range. While this functional form is similar to that for <0.1Msun isolated objects, over the entire 0.01-1.0Msun range the mass functions of companions and of isolated objects differ significantly. Based on this conclusion and on similar results from other direct imaging and radial velocity companion surveys in the literature, we argue that the companion mass function follows the same universal form over the entire range between 0-1590AU in orbital semi-major axis and 0.01-20Msun in companion mass. In this context, the relative dearth of substellar versus stellar secondaries at all orbital separations arises naturally from the inferred form of the companion mass function.

Oliver, J.-C. Raynal	Abstract:  In the heavy quark limit of QCD, using the Operator Product Expansion, the formalism of Falk for hadrons or arbitrary spin, and the non-forward amplitude, as proposed by Uraltsev, we formulate sum rules involving the Isgur-Wise function $ξ_Λ (w)$ of the baryon transition $Λ_b \to Λ_c \ell \overlineν_{\ell}$, where the light cloud has $j^P=0^+$ for both initial and final baryons. We recover the lower bound for the slope $ρ_Λ^2 = - ξ'_Λ(1) \geq 0$ obtained by Isgur et al., and we generalize it by demonstrating that the IW function $ξ_Λ (w)$ is an alternate series in powers of $(w-1)$, i.e. $(-1)^n ξ_Λ^{(n)} (1) \geq 0$. Moreover, exploiting systematically the sum rules, we get an improved lower bound for the curvature in terms of the slope, $σ_Λ^2 = ξ "_Λ(1) \geq {3 \over 5} [ρ_Λ^2 + (ρ_Λ^2)^2]$. This bound constrains the shape of the Isgur-Wise function and it will be compelling in the analysis of future precise data on the differential rate of the baryon semileptonic decay $Λ_b \to Λ_c \ell \overlineν_{\ell}$, that has a large measured branching ratio, of about 5%. 
0808.02984	Building an interpretable fuzzy rule base from data using Orthogonal Least Squares Application to a depollution problem	Machine Learning (cs.LG)	Authors:Sébastien Destercke (IRSN, IRIT), Serge Guillaume (ITAP), Brigitte Charnomordic (ASB)    	Abstract:  In many fields where human understanding plays a crucial role, such as bioprocesses, the capacity of extracting knowledge from data is of critical importance. Within this framework, fuzzy learning methods, if properly used, can greatly help human experts. Amongst these methods, the aim of orthogonal transformations, which have been proven to be mathematically robust, is to build rules from a set of training data and to select the most important ones by linear regression or rank revealing techniques. The OLS algorithm is a good representative of those methods. However, it was originally designed so that it only cared about numerical performance. Thus, we propose some modifications of the original method to take interpretability into account. After recalling the original algorithm, this paper presents the changes made to the original method, then discusses some results obtained from benchmark problems. Finally, the algorithm is applied to a real-world fault detection depollution problem. 
0808.02985	$Υ$ decay to two-charm quark jets as a Probe of the Color Octet Mechanism	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Yu-Jie Zhang, Kuang-Ta Chao	Abstract:  We calculate the decay rate of bottomonium to two-charm quark jets $Υ \to c \bar c$ at the tree level and one-loop level including color-singlet and color-octet $b \bar b$ annihilations. We find that the short distance coefficient of the color-octet piece is much larger than the color-singlet piece, and that the QCD correction will change the endpoint behavior of the charm quark jet. The color-singlet piece is strongly affected by the one-loop QCD correction. In contrast, the QCD correction to the color-octet piece is weak. Once the experiment can measure the branching ratio and energy distribution of the two-charm quark jets in the $Υ$ decay, the result can be used to test the color octet mechanism or give a strong constraint on the color-octet matrix elements. 
0808.02986	The moderate magnetic field on the flare star Proxima Centauri	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ansgar Reiners, Gibor Basri	Abstract:  We report moderate magnetic flux of 450G < Bf < 750G (3sigma) on the nearby M5.5 flare star Proxima Centauri. A high resolution UVES spectrum was used to measure magnetic flux from Zeeman broadening in absorption lines of molecular FeH around 1mu. The magnetic flux we find is relatively weak compared with classical strong flare stars, but so are Proxima's flaring rates and actual emission levels. We compare what is known about the rotation rate, Rossby number, and activity levels in this star to relations between these quantities that have been recently being developed more generally for M dwarfs. We conclude that the magnetic flux is higher than the best estimates of the Rossby number from period measurements. On the other hand, the activity levels on Proxima Centauri are at the high end of what could be expected based on the measured field, but not so high as to exceed the natural scatter in these relations (other stars lie along this high envelope as well). 
0808.02987	On the sign problem in dense QCD	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Stephen D.H. Hsu, David Reeb	Abstract:  We investigate the Euclidean path integral formulation of QCD at finite baryon density and temperature. We show that the partition function Z can be written as a difference between two sums Z+ and Z-, each of which defines a partition function with positive weights. We call the sign problem severe if the ratio Z-/Z+ is nonzero in the infinite volume limit. This occurs only if, and generically always if, the associated free energy densities F+ and F- are equal in this limit. We present strong evidence here that the sign problem is severe at almost all points in the phase diagram, with the exception of special cases like exactly zero chemical potential (ordinary QCD), which requires a particular order of limits. Part of our reasoning is based on the analyticity of free energy densities within their open phase regions. Finally, we describe a Monte Carlo technique to simulate finite-density QCD in regions where Z-/Z+ is small. 
0808.02988	Extending Recovery of the Primordial Matter Power Spectrum	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jaiyul Yoo (1,2), David H. Weinberg (2), Jeremy L. Tinker (3), Zheng Zheng (4), Michael S. Warren (5) ((1) Harvard, (2) OSU, (3) KICP, (4) IAS, (5) LANL)    	Abstract:  The shape of the primordial matter power spectrum Plin(k) encodes critical information on cosmological parameters. At large scales, the observable galaxy power spectrum Pobs(k) is expected to follow the shape of Plin(k), but on smaller scales the effects of nonlinearity and galaxy bias make the ratio Pobs(k)/Plin(k) scale-dependent. We develop a method that can extend the dynamic range of the Plin(k) recovery by incorporating constraints on the galaxy halo occupation distribution (HOD) from the projected galaxy correlation function wp. We devise an analytic model to calculate Pobs(k) in real-space and redshift-space. Once HOD parameters are determined by matching wp for a given cosmological model, galaxy bias is completely specified, and our analytic model predicts both the shape and normalization of Pobs(k). Applying our method to SDSS main galaxy samples, we find that the real-space Pobs(k) follows the shape of the nonlinear matter power spectrum at the 1-2% level up to k=0.2 h/Mpc. When we apply our method to SDSS LRG samples, the linear bias approximation is accurate to 5% at k<0.08 h/Mpc, but the scale-dependence of LRG bias prevents the use of linear theory at k>0.08 h/Mpc. Our HOD model prediction is in good agreement with the recent SDSS LRG Pobs(k) measurements at all measured scales (k<0.2 h/Mpc), naturally explaining the shape of Pobs(k). The "Q-model" prescription is a poor description of galaxy bias for the LRG samples, and it can lead to biased cosmological parameter estimates when measurements at k>0.1 h/Mpc are included in the analysis. We quantify the potential bias and constraints on cosmological parameters that arise from applying linear theory and Q-model fitting, and we demonstrate the utility of HOD modeling of future high precision measurements of Pobs(k) on quasi-linear scales. 
0808.02989	Multiparty quantum states stabilized by the diagonal subgroup of the local unitary group	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:David W. Lyons, Scott N. Walck	Abstract:  We classify, up to local unitary equivalence, the set of $n$-qubit states that is stabilized by the diagonal subgroup of the local unitary group. We exhibit a basis for this set, parameterized by diagrams of nonintersecting chords connecting pairs of points on a circle, and give a criterion for when the stabilizer is precisely the diagonal subgroup and not larger. This investigation is part of a larger program to partially classify entanglement type (local unitary equivalence class) via analysis of stabilizer structure. 
0808.02990	Beilinson-Hodge cycles on semiabelian varieties	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Donu Arapura, Manish Kumar	Abstract:  Beilinson conjectured that all rational cycles of type (q,q) on the qth cohomology of a smooth complex algebraic variety should come from motivic cohomology. The purpose of this note is to prove this when the variety is a semiabelian variety or a product of curves. The proof is based on the study of invariants under the Mumford-Tate group. 
0808.02991	Abelian Zero Modes in Odd Dimensions	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Gerald V. Dunne, Hyunsoo Min	Abstract:  We show that the Loss-Yau zero modes of the 3d abelian Dirac operator may be interpreted in a simple manner in terms of a stereographic projection from a 4d Dirac operator with a constant field strength of definite helicity. This is an alternative to the conventional viewpoint involving Hopf maps from S^3 to S^2. Furthermore, our construction generalizes in a straightforward way to any odd dimension. The number of zero modes is related to the Chern-Simons number in a nonlinear manner. 
0808.02992	Pretty Fast Analysis: An embarrassingly parallel algorithm for biological simulation analysis	Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)	Authors:David N. Lebard	Abstract:  A parallel code has been written in FORTRAN90, C, and MPI for the analysis of biological simulation data. Using a master/slave algorithm, the software operates on AMBER generated trajectory data using either UNIX or MPI file IO, and it supports up to 15 simultaneous function calls. This software has been performance tested on the Ranger Supercomputer on trajectory data of an aqueous bacterial reaction center micelle. Although the parallel reading is poor, the analysis algorithm itself shows embarrassingly parallel speedup up to 1024 compute nodes. At this CPU count the overall scaling of the software compares well NAMD's best reported speedup, and outperforms AMBER's best known scaling by a factor of 3, while using only a small number of function calls and a short trajectory length. 
0808.02993	Transversality of Electromagnetic Waves in the Calculus-Based Introductory Physics Course	Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)	Authors:Lior M. Burko	Abstract:  Introductory calculus-based physics textbooks state that electromagnetic waves are transverse and list many of their properties, but most such textbooks do not bring forth arguments why this is so. Both physical and theoretical arguments are at a level appropriate for students of courses based on such books, and could be readily used by instructors of such courses. Here, we discuss two physical arguments (based on polarization experiments and on lack of monopole electromagnetic radiation), and the full argument for the transversality of (plane) electromagnetic waves based on the integral Maxwell equations. We also show, at a level appropriate for the introductory course, why the electric and magnetic fields in a wave are in phase and the relation of their magnitudes. 
0808.02994	The flip-side of galaxy formation: A combined model of Galaxy Formation and Cluster Heating	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Richard G. Bower (1), Ian G. McCarthy (1), Andrew J. Benson (2) ((1) ICC, Durham, (2) Caltech)    	Abstract:  Only ~10% of baryons in the universe are in the form of stars, yet most models of luminous structure formation have concentrated on the properties of the luminous stellar matter. In this paper we focus on the "flip side" of galaxy formation and investigate the properties of the material that is not presently locked up in galaxies. This "by-product" of galaxy formation can be observed as an X-ray emitting plasma (the intracluster medium, hereafter ICM) in groups and clusters, and we present a version of the Durham semi-analytic galaxy formation model GALFORM that allows us to investigate the properties of the ICM. As we would expect on the basis of gravitational scaling arguments, the previous model (presented in Bower et al. 2006) fails to reproduce even the most basic observed properties of the ICM; however, we present a simple modification to the model to allow for heat input into the ICM from the AGN "radio mode" feedback. This heating acts to expel gas from the X-ray luminous central regions of the host halo. With this modification, the model reproduces the observed gas mass fractions and luminosity-temperature relation of groups and clusters. Introducing the heating process into the model requires changes to a number of model parameters in order to retain a good match to the observed galaxy properties. With the revised parameters, the best fitting luminosity function is comparable to that presented in Bower et al. (2006). The new model makes a fundamental step forward, providing a unified model of galaxy and cluster ICM formation. However, the detailed comparison with the data is not completely satisfactory, and we highlight key areas for improvement. 
0808.02995	Nilpotent orbits in classical Lie algebras over finite fields of characteristic 2 and the Springer correspondence	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Ting Xue	Abstract:  Let $G$ be an adjoint algebraic group of type $B$, $C$, or $D$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2. We construct a Springer correspondence for the Lie algebra of $G$. In particular, for orthogonal Lie algebras in characteristic 2, the structure of component groups of nilpotent centralizers is determined and the number of nilpotent orbits over finite fields is obtained. 
0808.02996	Moduli spaces for finite-order jets of Riemannian metrics	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:A. Gordillo, J. Navarro, J. B. Sancho	Abstract:  We construct the moduli space of r-jets at a point of Riemannian metrics on a smooth manifold. The construction is closely related to the problem of classification of jet metrics via differential invariants. The moduli space is proved to be a differentiable space which admits a finite canonical stratification into smooth manifolds. A complete study on the stratification of moduli spaces is carried out for metrics in dimension n=2. 
0808.02997	Representations of $asl_2$	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Sophie Morier-Genoud	Abstract:  We study representations of the simple Lie antialgebra $asl_2$ introduced by Ovsienko. We show that representations of $asl_2$ are closely related to the famous ghost Casimir element of the universal enveloping algebra $osp(1|2)$. We prove that $asl_2$ has no non-trivial finite-dimensional representations; we define and classify some particular infinite-dimensional representations that we call weighted representations. 
0808.02998	Nilpotent orbits in the dual of classical Lie algebras in characteristic 2 and the Springer correspondence	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Ting Xue	Abstract:  Let $G$ be a simply connected algebraic group of type $B,C$ or $D$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 2. We construct a Springer correspondence for the dual vector space of the Lie algebra of $G$. In particular, we classify the nilpotent orbits in the duals of symplectic and orthogonal Lie algebras over algebraically closed or finite fields of characteristic 2. 
0808.02999	Variations of parameters in nucleation process under different external conditions	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Victor Kurasov	Abstract:  The nucleation process under different external conditions is considered. It is shown that the duration of this process can be connected with the microscopic corrections to the free energy of the critical embryo. Connection between variations in the value of the critical embryo free energy and the duration of the nucleation stage is given for several types of external conditions. This connection is in some cases reciprocal to uncertainty relation in quantum theory. In Appendix the derivation of main features of the general theory on the base of restrictions coming from the possibility of effective and stable observations is given. 
0808.03000	A Charged Doubly Spinning Black Ring	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:James Hoskisson	Abstract:  This paper calculates the general form of a 5d metric when fundamental string and momentum charges are added. This is accomplished using the standard method of boosting and T-dualising a solution to Einstein's equations, where the solution has three Killing vectors and is expressed in a generic form. The thermodynamical properties of the charged solution are derived and the physical implications of the solution are then examined with the two-charge dual spinning black ring being used as an example. 
0808.03001	Dynamical Functions of a 1D Correlated Quantum Liquid	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:J. M. P. Carmelo, D. Bozi, K. Penc	Abstract:  We extend to initial ground states with zero spin density m = 0 the expressions provided by the pseudofermion dynamical theory (PDT) for the finite-energy one- and two-electron spectral-weight distributions of a one-dimensional (1D) correlated metal with on-site particle-particle repulsion. The spectral-function expressions derived in this paper were used in recent successful and detailed theoretical studies of the finite-energy singular features in photoemission of the organic compound tetrathiafulvalene-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TTF-TCNQ) metallic phase. Our studies take into account spectral contributions from types of microscopic processes that do not occur for finite values of the spin density. Expressions for the spectral functions in the vicinity of the singular border lines which also appear in the TTF- TCNQ spectral-weight distribution are derived. In addition, the PDT expressions are generalized for electronic densities in the vicinity of half filling. Further details on the processes involved in the applications to TTF-TCNQ are reported. Our results are useful for the further understanding of the unusual spectral properties observed in low-dimensional organic metals and also provide expressions for the one- and two-atom spectral functions of a correlated quantum system of ultracold fermionic atoms in a 1D optical lattice with on-site two-atom repulsion. 
0808.03002	Stress induced stripe formation in Pd/W(110)	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:T.O. Mentes, A. Locatelli, L. Aballe, E. Bauer	Abstract:  A stress-induced stripe phase of submonolayer Pd on W(110) is observed by low-energy electron microscopy. The temperature dependence of the pattern is explained by the change both in the boundary free energy and elastic relaxation energy due to the increasing boundary width. The stripes are shown to disorder when the correlation length of the condensed phase becomes comparable to its period, while the condensate to lattice-gas transition takes place at a higher temperature, as revealed by low-energy electron diffraction. 
0808.03003	Codes Associated with Orthogonal Groups and Power Moments of Kloosterman Sums	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Dae San Kim (Sogang University)    	Abstract:  In this paper, we construct three binary linear codes $C(SO^{-}(2,q))$, $C(O^{-}(2,q))$, $C(SO^{-}(4,q))$, respectively associated with the orthogonal groups $SO^{-}(2,q)$, $O^{-}(2,q)$, $SO^{-}(4,q)$, with $q$ powers of two. Then we obtain recursive formulas for the power moments of Kloosterman and 2-dimensional Kloosterman sums in terms of the frequencies of weights in the codes. This is done via Pless power moment identity and by utilizing the explicit expressions of Gauss sums for the orthogonal groups. We emphasize that, when the recursive formulas for the power moments of Kloosterman sums are compared, the present one is computationally more effective than the previous one constructed from the special linear group $SL(2,q)$. We illustrate our results with some examples. 
0808.03004	Up-and-Down and the Percentile-Finding Problem	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:Assaf P. Oron	Abstract:  Up-and-Down (U&D) is a popular sequential design for estimating threshold percentiles in binary experiments. However, U&D application practices have stagnated, and significant gaps in understanding its properties persist. The first part of my work aims to fill gaps in U&D theory. New results concerning stationary distribution properties are proven. A second focus of this study is nonparametric U&D estimation. An improvement to isotonic regression called "centered isotonic regression" (CIR), and a new averaging estimator called "auto-detect" are introduced and their properties studied. Bayesian percentile-finding designs, most notably the continual reassessment method (CRM) developed for Phase I clinical trials, are also studied. In general, CRM convergence depends upon random run-time conditions -- meaning that convergence is not always assured. Small-sample behavior is studied as well. It is shown that CRM is quite sensitive to outlier sub-sequences of thresholds, resulting in highly variable small-sample behavior between runs under identical conditions. Nonparametric CRM variants exhibit a similar sensitivity. Ideas to combine the advantages of U&D and Bayesian designs are examined. A new approach is developed, using a hybrid framework, that evaluates the evidence for overriding the U&D allocation with a Bayesian one. 
0808.03005	Perturbation Method for Classical Spinning Particle Motion: I. Kerr Space-Time	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Dinesh Singh	Abstract:  This paper presents an analytic perturbation approach to the dynamics of a classical spinning particle, according to the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations of motion, with a direct application to circular motion around a Kerr black hole. The formalism is established in terms of a power series expansion with respect to the particle's spin magnitude, where the particle's kinematic and dynamical degrees are expressed in a completely general form that can be constructed to infinite order in the expansion parameter. It is further shown that the particle's squared mass and spin magnitude can shift due to a classical analogue of radiative corrections that arise from spin-curvature coupling. Explicit expressions are determined for the case of circular motion near the event horizon a Kerr black hole, where the mass and spin shift contributions are dependent on the initial conditions of the particle's spin orientation. A preliminary analysis of the stability properties of the orbital motion in the Kerr background due to spin-curvature interactions is explored and briefly discussed. 
0808.03006	Perturbation Method for Classical Spinning Particle Motion: II. Vaidya Space-Time	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Dinesh Singh	Abstract:  This paper describes an application of the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations in analytic perturbation form to the case of circular motion around a radially accreting or radiating black hole described by the Vaidya metric. Based on the formalism presented earlier, this paper explores the effects of mass accretion or loss of the central body on the overall dynamics of the orbiting spinning particle. This includes changes to its squared mass and spin magnitude due to the classical analog of radiative corrections from spin-curvature coupling. Various quantitative consequences are explored when considering orbital motion near the black hole's event horizon. An analysis on the orbital stability properties due to spin-curvature interactions is examined briefly, with conclusions in general agreement with previous work performed for the case of circular motion around a Kerr black hole. 
0808.03007	The Rise of the Vulcans	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:David Charbonneau	Abstract:  In this introductory review presented at the IAU Symposium 253 "Transiting Planets", I summarize the path from the initial 1995 radial-velocity discovery of hot Jupiters to the current rich panoply of investigations that are afforded when such objects are observed to transit their parent stars. Forty transiting exoplanets are now known, and the time for that population to double has dropped below one year. It is only for these objects that we have direct estimates of their masses and radii, and for which (at the current time) we can undertake direct studies of the chemistries and dynamics of their atmospheres. Informed by the successes of hot Jupiter studies, I outline a path for the spectroscopic study of certain habitable exoplanets that obviates the need for direct imaging. 
0808.03008	Origin of the Large Perturbative Corrections to Higgs Production at Hadron Colliders	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Valentin Ahrens, Thomas Becher, Matthias Neubert, Li Lin Yang	Abstract:  The very large K-factor for Higgs-boson production at hadron colliders is shown to result from enhanced perturbative corrections of the form (C_Aπα_s)^n, which arise in the analytic continuation of the gluon form factor to time-like momentum transfer. These terms are resummed to all orders in perturbation theory using the renormalization group. After the resummation, the K-factor for the production of a light Higgs boson at the LHC is reduced to a value close to 1.3. 
0808.03009	Accuracy of BCS-based approximations for pairing in small Fermi systems	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:N. Sandulescu, G. F. Bertsch	Abstract:  We analyze the accuracy of BCS-based approximations for calculating correlation energies and odd-even energy differences in 2-component fermionic systems with a small number of pairs. The analysis is focused on comparing BCS and projected BCS treatments with the exact solution of the pairing Hamiltonian, considering parameter ranges appropriate for nuclear pairing energies. We find that the projected BCS is quite accurate over the entire range of coupling strengths in spaces of up to about 20 doubly degenerate orbitals. It is also quite accurate for two cases we considered with a more realistic Hamiltonian, representing the nuclei around 117Sn and 207Pb. However, the projected BCS significantly underestimates the energies for much larger spaces when the pairing is weak. 
0808.03010	Theory of the Ordered Phase in A-site Antiferromagnetic Spinels	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:SungBin Lee, Leon Balents	Abstract:  Insulating spinel materials, with the chemical formula $AB_2X_4$, behave as diamond lattice antiferromagnets when only the A-site atom is magnetic. Many exhibit classic signatures of frustration, induced not geometrically but by competing first and second neighbor exchange interactions. In this paper, we further develop a theory of the magnetism of these materials, focusing on the physics observable within the ordered state. We derive a phenomenological Landau theory that predicts the orientation of the spins within incommensurate spiral ordered states. It also describes how the spins reorient in a magnetic field, and how they may undergo a low temperature "lock-in" transition to a commensurate state. We discuss microscopic mechanisms for these magnetic anisotropy effects. The reduction of the ordered moment by quantum fluctuations is shown to be enhanced due to frustration. Our results are compared to experiments on MnSc_2S_4, the best characterized of such A-site spinels, and more general implications are discussed. One prediction is that magnetically-induced ferroelectricity is generic in these materials, and a detailed description of the relation of the electric polarization to the magnetism is given. 
0808.03011	A Colding-Minicozzi Stability inequality and its applications	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Jose M. Espinar, Harold Rosenberg	Abstract:  We consider operators $L$ acting on functions on a Riemannian surface, $Σ$, of the form $L = Δ+ V +a K.$ Here $Δ$ is the Laplacian of $Σ$, $V$ a non-negative potential on $Σ$, K the Gaussian curvature and $a$ is a non-negative constant. Such operators $L$ arise as the stability operator of $Σ$ immersed in a Riemannian 3-manifold with constant mean curvature (for particular choices of $V$ and $a$). We assume L is nonpositive acting on functions compactly supported on $Σ$ and we obtain results in the spirit of some theorems of Ficher-Colbrie-Schoen, Colding-Minicozzi, and Castillon. We extend these theorems to $a \leq 1/4$. We obtain results on the conformal type of $Σ$ and a distance (to the boundary) lemma. 
0808.03012	Chiral sedimentation of extended objects in viscous media	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Nathan W. Krapf, Thomas A. Witten, Nathan C. Keim	Abstract:  We study theoretically the chirality of a generic rigid object's sedimentation in a fluid under gravity in the low Reynolds number regime. We represent the object as a collection of small Stokes spheres or stokeslets, and the gravitational force as a constant point force applied at an arbitrary point of the object. For a generic configuration of stokeslets and forcing point, the motion takes a simple form in the nearly free draining limit where the stokeslet radius is arbitrarily small. In this case, the internal hydrodynamic interactions between stokeslets are weak, and the object follows a helical path while rotating at a constant angular velocity $ω$ about a fixed axis. This $ω$ is independent of initial orientation, and thus constitutes a chiral response for the object. Even though there can be no such chiral response in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions between the stokeslets, the angular velocity obtains a fixed, nonzero limit as the stokeslet radius approaches zero. We characterize empirically how $ω$ depends on the placement of the stokeslets, concentrating on three-stokeslet objects with the external force applied far from the stokeslets. Objects with the largest $ω$ are aligned along the forcing direction. In this case, the limiting $ω$ varies as the inverse square of the minimum distance between stokeslets. We illustrate the prevalence of this robust chiral motion with experiments on small macroscopic objects of arbitrary shape. 
0808.03013	Properties of protostars in the Elephant Trunk globule IC 1396A	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:William T. Reach, Dohy Faied, Jeonghee Rho, Adwin Boogert, Achim Tappe, Thomas H. Jarrett, Patrick Morris, Laurent Cambresy, Francesco Palla, Riccardo Valdettaro	Abstract:  Extremely red objects, identified in the early Spitzer Space Telescope observations of the bright-rimmed globule IC 1396A and photometrically classified as Class I protostars Class II T Tauri stars based on their mid-infrared colors, were observed spectroscopically at 5.5 to 38 microns (IRS), at the 22 GHz water maser frequency (GBT), and in the optical (Palomar). The sources photometrically identified as Class I are confirmed as objects dominated by accretion luminosity from dense envelopes, with accretion rates 1e-5 to 1e-6 Msun/yr. The ice/silicate absorption ratio in the envelope is exceptionally low for the IC 1396A protostars, compared to those in nearby star-forming regions, suggesting the envelope chemistry is altered by the radiation field or globule pressure. Only one 22 GHz water maser was detected in IC 1396A; its infrared counterpart has luminosity <0.1 Lsun, the first H2O maser from such a low-luminosity object. The objects photometrically classified as Class II are confirmed as classical T Tauri stars with warm, luminous disks. The disk properties change significantly with source luminosity: low-mass (G-K) stars have prominent 9-11 micron emission features due to amorphous silicates while higher-mass (A-F) stars have weaker features requiring abundant crystalline silicates. The distribution of Class I sources is concentrated within the molecular globule, while the Class II sources are more widely scattered. Combined with the spectral results, this suggests two phases of star formation, the first (4 Myr ago) leading to the widespread Class II sources and the central O star of IC 1396, and the second (<1 Myr ago) occurring within the globule. 
0808.03014	Microlensing Zone of Planets Detectable through the Channel of High-Magnification Events	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Cheongho Han	Abstract:  A microlensing lensing zone refers to the range of planet-star separations where the probability of detecting a planetary signal is high. Its conventional definition as the range between $\sim 0.6$ and 1.6 Einstein radii of the primary lens is based on the criterion that a major caustic induced by a planet should be located within the Einstein ring of the primary. However, current planetary lensing searches focus on high-magnification events to detect perturbations induced by another caustic located always within the Einstein ring very close to the primary lens (stellar caustic) and thus a new definition of a lensing zone is needed. In this paper, we determine this lensing zone. By applying a criterion that detectable planets should produce signals $\geq 5%$, we find that the new lensing zone varies depending on the planet/star mass ratio unlike the fixed range of the classical zone regardless of the mass ratio. The lensing zone is equivalent to the classical zone for a planet with a planet/star mass ratio $q\sim 3\times 10^{-4}$ and it becomes wider for heavier planets. For a Jupiter-mass planet, the lensing zone ranges from 0.25 to 3.9 Einstein radii, corresponding to a physical range between $\sim 0.5$ AU and 7.4 AU for a typical Galactic event. The wider lensing zone of central perturbations for giant planets implies that the microlensing method provides an important tool to detect planetary systems composed of multiple ice-giant planets. 
0808.03015	Phase Coherence Effects in the Vortex Transport Entropy	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:G. Bridoux, G. Nieva, F. de la Cruz	Abstract:  Nernst and electrical resistivity measurements in superconducting YBCO and BSCCO with and without columnar defects show a distinctive thermodynamics of the respective liquid vortex matter. At a field dependent high temperature region in the phase diagram the Nernst signal is independent of structural defects in both materials. At lower temperatures, in YBCO, defects contribute only to the vortex mobility and the transport entropy is that of a system of vortex lines. The transition to lower temperatures in BSCCO has a different origin, the maximum in the Nernst signal when decreasing temperature is not associated with transport properties but with the entropy behavior of pancake vortices in the presence of structural defects. 
0808.03016	Scanning tunneling spectroscopic evidence for magnetic field-induced microscopic orders in the high-$T_c$ superconductor YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:A.D. Beyer, M.S. Grinolds, M.L. Teague, S. Tajima, N.-C. Yeh	Abstract:  We report spatially resolved tunneling spectroscopic evidence for field-induced microscopic orders in a high-$T_c$ superconductor $\rm YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-δ}$. The spectral characteristics inside vortices reveal a pseudogap ($V_{\rm CO}$) larger than the superconducting gap ($Δ\_{\rm SC}$) as well as a subgap ($Δ\^{\prime}$) smaller than $Δ\_{\rm SC}$, and the spectral weight shifts steadily from $Δ_{\rm SC}$ to $V_{\rm CO}$ and $Δ\^{\prime}$ upon increasing magnetic field. Additionally, energy-independent conductance modulations at 3.6 and 7.1 lattice constants along the Cu-O bonding directions and at 9.5 lattice constants along the nodal directions are manifested in the vortex state. These wave-vectors differ fundamentally from the strongly dispersive modes due to Bogoliubov quasiparticle scattering interferences and may be associated with field-induced microscopic orders of pair-, charge- and spin-density waves. 
0808.03017	Optimal prediction in molecular dynamics	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Benjamin Seibold	Abstract:  Optimal prediction approximates the average solution of a large system of ordinary differential equations by a smaller system. We present how optimal prediction can be applied to a typical problem in the field of molecular dynamics, in order to reduce the number of particles to be tracked in the computations. We consider a model problem, which describes a surface coating process, and show how asymptotic methods can be employed to approximate the high dimensional conditional expectations, which arise in optimal prediction. The thus derived smaller system is compared to the original system in terms of statistical quantities, such as diffusion constants. The comparison is carried out by Monte-Carlo simulations, and it is shown under which conditions optimal prediction yields a valid approximation to the original system. 
0808.03018	Precise predictions for the Higgs production in association with a W-boson pair at ILC	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Song Mao, Ma Wen-Gan, Zhang Ren-You, Guo Lei, Wang Shao-Ming	Abstract:  The Higgs-boson production in association with a W-boson pair at $e^+e^-$ linear colliders is one of the important processes in probing the coupling between Higgs-boson and vector gauge bosons and discovering the signature of new physics. We describe the impact of the complete electroweak(EW) radiative corrections of ${\cal O}(α_{ew})$ to this process in the standard model(SM) at the International Linear Collider(ILC), and investigate the dependence of the lowest-order(LO) and EW next-to-leading order(NLO) corrected cross sections on colliding energy $\sqrt{s}$ and Higg-boson mass. The LO and NLO EW corrected distributions of the invariant mass of W-boson pair and the transverse momenta of final $W$- and Higgs-boson are presented. Our numerical results show that the relative EW radiative correction($δ_{ew}$) varies from -19.4% to 0.2% when $m_H=120 GeV$ and $\sqrt{s}$ goes up from $300 GeV$ to $1.2 TeV$. 
0808.03019	Data Mining Using High Performance Data Clouds: Experimental Studies Using Sector and Sphere	Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)	Authors:Robert L Grossman, Yunhong Gu	Abstract:  We describe the design and implementation of a high performance cloud that we have used to archive, analyze and mine large distributed data sets. By a cloud, we mean an infrastructure that provides resources and/or services over the Internet. A storage cloud provides storage services, while a compute cloud provides compute services. We describe the design of the Sector storage cloud and how it provides the storage services required by the Sphere compute cloud. We also describe the programming paradigm supported by the Sphere compute cloud. Sector and Sphere are designed for analyzing large data sets using computer clusters connected with wide area high performance networks (for example, 10+ Gb/s). We describe a distributed data mining application that we have developed using Sector and Sphere. Finally, we describe some experimental studies comparing Sector/Sphere to Hadoop. 
0808.03020	Non-structure in lambda^{++} using instances of WGCH	Logic (math.LO)	Authors:Saharon Shelah	Abstract:  We try to redo, improve and continue the non-structure parts in some works on a.e.c., which uses weak diamond, in lambda^+ and lambda^{++} getting better and more results and do what is necessary for the book on a.e.c. Comparing with math.LO/9805146 we make the context closer to the examples, hence hopefully improve transparency, though losing some generality. Toward this we work also on the positive theory, i.e. structure side of "low frameworks" like almost good lambda-frames. 
0808.03021	On the concentration and the convergence rate with a moment condition in first passage percolation	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Yu Zhang	Abstract:  We consider the first passage percolation model on the ${\bf Z}^d$ lattice. In this model, we assign independently to each edge $e$ a non-negative passage time $t(e)$ with a common distribution $F$. Let $a_{0,n}$ be the passage time from the origin to $(n,0,..., 0)$. Under the exponential tail assumption, Kesten (1993) and Talagrand (1995) investigated the concentration of $a_{0,n}$ from its mean using different methods. With this concentration and the exponential tail assumption, Alexander gave an estimate for the convergence rate for ${\bf E} a_{0,n}$. In this paper, focusing on a moment condition, we reinvestigate the concentration and the convergence rate for $a_{0,n}$ using a special martingale structure.

The observations were carried out using five imaging filters (3, 7, 11, 15, and 24 micron) and a dispersion prism (2 -- 5 micron, $λ/ Δλ$ $\sim$ 20) equipped in the IRC. This paper describes the outline of our survey project and presents some initial results using the imaging data that detected over 5.9x10^5 near-infrared and 6.4x10^4 mid-infrared point sources. The 10 $σ$ detection limits of our survey are about 16.5, 14.0, 12.3, 10.8, and 9.2 in Vega-magnitude at 3, 7, 11, 15, and 24 micron, respectively. The 11 and 15 micron data, which are unique to AKARI IRC, allow us to construct color-magnitude diagrams that are useful to identify stars with circumstellar dust. We found a new sequence in the color-magnitude diagram, which is attributed to red giants with luminosity fainter than that of the tip of the first red giant branch. We suggest that this sequence is likely to be related to the broad emission feature of aluminium oxide at 11.5 micron. The 11 and 15 micron data also indicate that the ([11] - [15]) micron color of both oxygen-rich and carbon-rich red giants once becomes blue and then turns red again in the course of their evolution, probably due to the change in the flux ratio of the silicate or silicon carbide emission feature at 10 or 11.3 micron to the 15 micron flux. 
0808.03023	Categoricity and solvability of A.E.C., quite highly	Logic (math.LO)	Authors:Saharon Shelah	Abstract:  We investigate in ZFC what can be the family of large enough cardinals mu in which an a.e.c. K is categorical or even just solvable. We show that for not few cardinals lambda<mu there is a superlimit model in K_lambda. Moreover, our main result is that we can find a good lambda-frame s categorical in lambda such that K_s subseteq K_lambda. We then show how to use [Sh:705] to get categoricity in every large enough cardinality if K has cases of mu-amalgamation for enough mu and 2^mu<2^{mu^{+1}} <... < 2^{mu^{+n}}... for enough mu. 
0808.03024	A Toy Model for Topology Change Transitions: Role of Curvature Corrections	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Valeri P. Frolov, Dan Gorbonos	Abstract:  We consider properties of near-critical solutions describing a test static axisymmetric D-dimensional brane interacting with a bulk N-dimensional black hole (N>D). We focus our attention on the effects connected with curvature corrections to the brane action. Namely, we demonstrate that the second order phase transition in such a system is modified and becomes first order. We discuss possible consequences of these results for merger transitions between caged black holes and black strings. 
0808.03025	Color-Inclination Relation of the Classical Kuiper Belt Objects	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Nuno Peixinho, Pedro Lacerda, David Jewitt	Abstract:  We re-examine the correlation between the colors and the inclinations of the Classical Kuiper Belt Objects (CKBOs) with an enlarged sample of optical measurements. The correlation is strong (rho=-0.7) and highly significant (>8 sigma) in the range 0-34 deg. Nonetheless, the optical colors are independent of inclination below ~12 deg, showing no evidence for a break at the reported boundary between the so-called dynamically "hot" and "cold" populations near ~5 deg. The commonly accepted parity between the dynamically cold CKBOs and the red CKBOs is observationally unsubstantiated, since the group of red CKBOs extends to higher inclinations. Our data suggest, however, the existence of a different color break. We find that the functional form of the color-inclination relation is most satisfactorily described by a non-linear and stepwise behavior with a color break at ~12 deg. Objects with inclinations >12 deg show bluish colors which are either weakly correlated with inclination or are simply homogeneously blue, whereas objects with inclinations <12 deg are homogeneously red. 
0808.03026	Difference in Narrow Emission Line Spectra of Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Kai Zhang, Tinggui Wang, Xiaobo Dong, Honglin Lu	Abstract:  In the unification scheme of Seyfert galaxies, a dusty torus blocks the continuum source and broad line region in Seyfert 2 galaxies. However it is not clear whether or not and to what extent the torus affects the narrow line spectra. In this paper, we show that Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies have different distributions on the [OIII]/H$β$ vs [NII]/H$α$ diagram (BPT diagram) for narrow lines. Seyfert 2 galaxies display a clear left boundary on the BPT diagram and only 7.3% of them lie on the left. By contrast, Seyfert 1 galaxies do not show such a cutoff and 33.0% of them stand on the left side of the boundary. Among Seyfert 1 galaxies, the distribution varies with the extinction to broad lines. As the extinction increases, the distribution on BPT diagram moves to larger [NII]/H$α$ value. We interpret this as an evidence for the obscuration of inner dense narrow line region by the dusty torus. We also demonstrate that the [OIII] and broad line luminosity correlation depends on the extinction of broad lines in the way that high extinction objects have lower uncorrected [OIII] luminosities, suggesting that [OIII] is partially obscured in these objects. Therefore, using [OIII] as an indicator for the nuclear luminosity will systematically under-estimate the nuclear luminosity of Seyfert 2 galaxies. 
0808.03027	Quantum computation with the Jaynes-Cummings model	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Hiroo Azuma	Abstract:  In this paper, we propose a method for building a two-qubit gate with the Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). In our scheme, we construct a qubit from a pair of optical paths where a photon is running. Generating Knill, Laflamme and Milburn's nonlinear sign-shift gate by the JCM, we construct the conditional sign-flip gate, which works with small error probability in principle. We also discuss two experimental setups for realizing our scheme. In the first experimental setup, we make use of coherent lights to examine whether or not our scheme works. In the second experimental setup, an optical loop circuit made out of the polarizing beam splitter and the Pockels cell takes an important role in the cavity. 
0808.03028	Nonautonomous Hamiltonian Systems and Morales-Ramis Theory I. The Case $\ddot{x}=f(x,t)$	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Primitivo B. Acosta-Humanez	Abstract:  In this paper we present an approach towards the comprehensive analysis of the non-integrability of differential equations in the form $\ddot x=f(x,t)$ which is analogous to Hamiltonian systems with 1+1/2 degree of freedom. In particular, we analyze the non-integrability of some important families of differential equations such as Painlevé II, Sitnikov and Hill-Schrödinger equation. We emphasize in Painlevé II, showing its non-integrability through three different Hamiltonian systems, and also in Sitnikov in which two different version including numerical results are shown. The main tool to study the non-integrability of these kind of Hamiltonian systems is Morales-Ramis theory. This paper is a very slight improvement of the talk with the almost-same title delivered by the author in SIAM Conference on Applications of Dynamical Systems 2007. 
0808.03029	Twisted cyclic theory, equivariant KK theory and KMS States	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Alan L. Carey, Sergey Neshveyev, Ryszard Nest, Adam Rennie	Abstract:  Recently, examples of an index theory for KMS states of circle actions were discovered, \cite{CPR2,CRT}. We show that these examples are not isolated. Rather there is a general framework in which we use KMS states for circle actions on a C*-algebra A to construct Kasparov modules and semifinite spectral triples. By using a residue construction analogous to that used in the semifinite local index formula we associate to these triples a twisted cyclic cocycle on a dense subalgebra of A. This cocycle pairs with the equivariant KK-theory of the mapping cone algebra for the inclusion of the fixed point algebra of the circle action in A. The pairing is expressed in terms of spectral flow between a pair of unbounded self adjoint operators that are Fredholm in the semifinite sense. A novel aspect of our work is the discovery of an eta cocycle that forms a part of our twisted residue cocycle. To illustrate our theorems we observe firstly that they incorporate the results in \cite{CPR2,CRT} as special cases. Next we use the Araki-Woods III_λ representations of the Fermion algebra to show that there are examples which are not Cuntz-Krieger systems. 
0808.03030	Free Solution Electrophoresis of Homopolyelectrolytes	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Pai-Yi Hsiao, Kun-Mao Wu	Abstract:  We investigate the behavior of single polyelectrolytes in multivalent salt solutions under the action of electric fields through computer simulations. The chain is unfolded in a strong electric field and aligned parallel to the field direction, and the chain size shows a sigmoidal transition. The unfolding electric field $E^*$ depends on the salt concentration and scales as $V^{-1/2}$ with $V$ being the ellipsoidal volume occupied by the chain. The magnitude of the electrophoretic mobility of chain drastically increases during the unfolding. The fact that $E^*$ depends on the chain length provides a plausible mechanism to separate long charged homopolymers by size in free solution electrophoresis via the unfolding transition of globule polyelectrolytes condensed by multivalent salt. 
0808.03031	Specific features of the effect of time dependent field on subdiffusing particles. The stochastic Liouville equation approach	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:A. I. Shushin	Abstract:  We analyze the effect of time dependent external field on non-Markovian migration described by the continuous time random walk (CTRW) approach. The rigorous method of treating the problem is proposed which is based on the Markovian representations of the CTRW approach and field modulation. The method is applied to the case of subdiffusive migration in which the exact formulas for the first and second moments of spatial distribution are derived. For oscillating external field they predict unusual dependence of the first moment on oscillation phase and anomalous field dependent contribution to

Emphasis is placed on the resonance tunneling feature and inter-valley scattering probability. It is shown that normal incidence transmission probabilities for monolayer and bilayer graphene exhibit different properties. Our calculation indicates that valleytronics in graphene systems may be detected, generated and controlled by changing the structure parameters of the external electric potential. 
0808.03033	Skew-product representations of multidimensional Dunkl Markov processes	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Oleksandr Chybiryakov	Abstract:  In this paper we obtain skew-product representations of the multidimensional Dunkl processes which generalize the skew-product decomposition in dimension 1 obtained in L. Gallardo and M. Yor. Some remarkable properties of the Dunkl martingales. Séminaire de Probabilités XXXIX, 2006. We also study the radial part of the Dunkl process, i.e. the projection of the Dunkl process on a Weyl chamber. 
0808.03034	Detecting quantum-coherent nanomechanical oscillations using the current-noise spectrum of a double quantum dot	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Neill Lambert, Franco Nori	Abstract:  We consider a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a double quantum dot. We demonstrate how the finite-frequency current noise spectrum through the double quantum dot can be used to distinguish classical and quantum behaviour in the nearby nano-electromechanical resonator. We also show how the full frequency current noise spectrum gives important information on the combined double quantum dot-resonator energy spectrum. Finally, we point out regimes where the quantum state of the resonator becomes squeezed, and also examine the cross-correlated electron-phonon current noise. 
0808.03035	Exponential Lower Bounds for Quasimodes of Semiclassical Schrödinger Operators	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Michael VanValkenburgh	Abstract:  We prove quantitative unique continuation results for the semiclassical Schrodinger operator on smooth, compact domains. These take the form of exponentially decreasing (in h) local L^{2} lower bounds for exponentially precise quasimodes. We also show that these lower bounds are sharp in h, and that, moreover, the hypothesized quasimode accuracy is also sharp. 
0808.03036	A New Type of Plasma Wakefield Accelerator Driven by Magnetowaves	Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph)	Authors:Pisin Chen, Feng-Yin Chang, Guey-Lin Lin, Robert J. Noble, Richard Sydora	Abstract:  We present a new concept for a plasma wakefield accelerator driven by magnetowaves (MPWA). This concept was originally proposed as a viable mechanism for the "cosmic accelerator" that would accelerate cosmic particles to ultra high energies in the astrophysical setting. Unlike the more familiar Plasma Wakefield Accelerator (PWFA) and the Laser Wakefield Accelerator (LWFA) where the drivers, the charged-particle beam and the laser, are independently existing entities, MPWA invokes the high-frequency and high-speed whistler mode as the driver, which is a medium wave that cannot exist outside of the plasma. Aside from the difference in drivers, the underlying mechanism that excites the plasma wakefield via the ponderomotive potential is common. Our computer simulations show that under appropriate conditions, the plasma wakefield maintains very high coherence and can sustain high-gradient acceleration over many plasma wavelengths. We suggest that in addition to its celestial application, the MPWA concept can also be of terrestrial utility. A proof-of-principle experiment on MPWA would benefit both terrestrial and celestial accelerator concepts. 
0808.03037	Limit laws for the energy of a charged polymer	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Xia Chen	Abstract:  In this paper we obtain the central limit theorems, moderate deviations and the laws of the iterated logarithm for the energy \[H_n=\sum_{1\le j<k\le n}ω_jω_k1_{\{S_j=S_k\}}\] of the polymer $\{S_1,...,S_n\}$ equipped with random electrical charges $\{ω_1,...,ω_n\}$. Our approach is based on comparison of the moments between $H_n$ and the self-intersection local time \[Q_n=\sum_{1\le j<k\le n}1_{\{S_j=S_k\}}\] run by the $d$-dimensional random walk $\{S_k\}$. As partially needed for our main objective and partially motivated by their independent interest, the central limit theorems and exponential integrability for $Q_n$ are also investigated in the case $d\ge3$. 
0808.03038	Tschirnhaus-Weierstrass curves	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Josef Schicho, David Sevilla	Abstract:  We define the concept of Tschirnhaus-Weierstrass curve, named after the Weierstrass form of an elliptic curve and Tschirnhaus transformations. Every pointed curve has a Tschirnhaus-Weierstrass form, and this representation is unique up to a scaling of variables. This is useful for computing isomorphisms between curves. 
0808.03039	Coulomb pseudogap in elastic 2D-2D electron tunneling in a quantizing magnetic field	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:V. G. Popov, O. N. Makarovskii, V. Renard, L. Eaves, J.-C. Portal	Abstract:  The electron tunneling is experimentally studied between two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) formed in a single-doped-barrier heterostructure in the magnetic fields directed perpendicular to the 2DEGs planes. It is well known that the quantizing magnetic field induces the Coulomb pseudogap suppressing the electron tunneling at Fermi level. In this paper we firstly present the experimental results revealing the pseudogap in the electron tunneling assisted by elastic electron scattering on disorder. 
0808.03040	Tkachenko waves, glitches and precession in neutron star	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S.B. Popov (Sternberg Astronomical Institute)    	Abstract:  Here I discuss possible relations between free precession of neutron stars, Tkachenko waves inside them and glitches. I note that the proposed precession period of the isolated neutron star RX J0720.4-3125 (Haberl et al. 2006) is consistent with the period of Tkachenko waves for the spin period 8.4s. Based on a possible observation of a glitch in RX J0720.4-3125 (van Kerkwijk et al. 2007), I propose a simple model, in which long period precession is powered by Tkachenko waves generated by a glitch. The period of free precession, determined by a NS oblateness, should be equal to the standing Tkachenko wave period for effective energy transfer from the standing wave to the precession motion. A similar scenario can be applicable also in the case of the PSR B1828-11. 
0808.03041	Spanning Trees on the Two-Dimensional Lattices with More Than One Type of Vertex	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Shu-Chiuan Chang	Abstract:  For a two-dimensional lattice $Λ$ with $n$ vertices, the number of spanning trees $N_{ST}(Λ)$ grows asymptotically as $\exp(n z_Λ)$ in the thermodynamic limit. We present exact integral expression and numerical value for the asymptotic growth constant $z_Λ$ for spanning trees on various two-dimensional lattices with more than one type of vertex given in \cite{Okeeffe}. An exact closed-form expression for the asymptotic growth constant is derived for net 14, and the asymptotic growth constants of net 27 and the triangle lattice have the simple relation $z_{27} = (z_{tri}+\ln 4)/4$. Some integral identities are also obtained. 
0808.03042	Null Melvin Twist to Sakai-Sugimoto model	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Shesansu Pal	Abstract:  The Null Melvin Twist to D4 brane background has been studied and putting in a bunch of coincident D8 and anti-D8 branes {\it a la} Sakai-Sugimoto model results in a breakdown of a global symmetry to its diagonal subgroup. The same is studied at finite temperature which results in the unchanged form of the chiral symmetry breaking and restoration curve. The effect of turning on a finite chemical potential do not changes the structure of the phase diagram with respect to Null Melvin Twist. Moreover, the confining and de-confining phase transition has the same structure as in the absence of Null Melvin Twist. 
0808.03043	Correlation between extrinsic electroresistance and magnetoresistance in fine-grained La0.7Ca0.3MnO3	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:P. Sujatha Devi, A. Kumar, Dipten Bhattacharya, Shilpi Karmakar, B.K. Chaudhuri	Abstract:  We report our observation of a correlation between the extrinsic electroresistance (EER) and magnetoresistance (EMR) via grain size in fine-grained La0.7Ca0.3MnO3. The nature of dependence of EER and EMR on grain size (~0.2-1.0 micron) indicates that for finer grains with low-resistive boundaries both of them follow similar trend whereas they differ for coarser grains with high-resistive boundaries. This could be due to a crossover in the mechanism of charge transport across the grain boundaries - from spin-depedent scattering process to spin-polarized tunneling one - as a function of grain size. 
0808.03044	Explicit and Almost Explicit Spectral Calculations for Diffusion Operators	Spectral Theory (math.SP)	Authors:Ross G. Pinsky	Abstract:  The diffusion operator $$ H_D=-\frac12\frac d{dx}a\frac d{dx}-b\frac d{dx}=-\frac12\exp(-2B)\frac d{dx}a\exp(2B)\frac d{dx}, $$ where $B(x)=\int_0^x\frac ba(y)dy$, defined either on $R^+=(0,\infty)$ with the Dirichlet boundary condition at $x=0$, or on $R$, can be realized as a self-adjoint operator with respect to the density $\exp(2Q(x))dx$. The operator is unitarily equivalent to the Schrödinger-type operator $H_S=-\frac12\frac d{dx}a\frac d{dx}+V_{b,a}$, where $V_{b,a}=\frac12(\frac{b^2}a+b')$. We obtain an explicit criterion for the existence of a compact resolvent and explicit formulas up to the multiplicative constant 4 for the infimum of the spectrum and for the infimum of the essential spectrum for these operators. We give some applications which show in particular how $\infσ(H_D)$ scales when $a=ν a_0$ and $b=γb_0$, where $ν$ and $γ$ are parameters, and $a_0$ and $b_0$ are chosen from certain classes of functions. We also give applications to self-adjoint, multi-dimensional diffusion operators. 
0808.03045	A seismic approach to testing different formation channels of subdwarf B stars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Haili Hu, M.-A. Dupret, C. Aerts, G. Nelemans, S. D. Kawaler, A. Miglio, J. Montalban, R. Scuflaire	Abstract:  There are many unknowns in the formation of subdwarf B stars. Different formation channels are considered to be possible and to lead to a variety of helium-burning subdwarfs. All seismic models to date, however, assume that a subdwarf B star is a post-helium-flash-core surrounded by a thin inert layer of hydrogen. We examine an alternative formation channel, in which the subdwarf B star originates from a massive (>~2 Msun) red giant with a non-degenerate helium-core. Although these subdwarfs may evolve through the same region of the log g-Teff diagram as the canonical post-flash subdwarfs, their interior structure is rather different. We examine how this difference affects their pulsation modes and whether it can be observed. Using detailed stellar evolution calculations we construct subdwarf B models from both formation channels. The iron accumulation in the driving region due to diffusion, which causes the excitation of the modes, is approximated by a Gaussian function. The pulsation modes and frequencies are calculated with a non-adiabatic pulsation code. A detailed comparison of two subdwarf B models from different channels, but with the same log g and Teff, shows that their mode excitation is different. The excited frequencies are lower for the post-flash than for the post-non-degenerate subdwarf B star. This is mainly due to the differing chemical composition of the stellar envelope. A more general comparison between two grids of models shows that the excited frequencies of most post-non-degenerate subdwarfs cannot be well-matched with the frequencies of post-flash subdwarfs. In the rare event that an acceptable seismic match is found, additional information, such as mode identification and log g and Teff determinations, allows us to distinguish between the two formation channels. 
0808.03046	Neutrinos, Electrons and Muons in Electromagnetic Fields and Matter: The Method of Exact Solutions	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Konstantin A. Kouzakov, Alexander I. Studenikin	Abstract:  We present a powerful method for exploring various processes in the presence of strong external fields and matter. The method implies utilization of the exact solutions of the modified Dirac equations which contain the effective potentials accounting for the influences of external electromagnetic fields and matter on particles. We briefly discuss the basics of the method and its applications to studies of different processes, including a recently proposed new mechanism of radiation by neutrinos and electrons moving in matter (the spin light of the neutrino and electron). In view of a recent "prediction" of an order-of-magnitude change of the muon lifetime under the influence of an electromagnetic field of a CO$_2$ laser, we revisit the issue and show that such claims are nonrealistic. 
0808.03047	More on Gribov copies and propagators in Landau-gauge Yang-Mills theory	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Axel Maas	Abstract:  Fixing a gauge in the non-perturbative domain of Yang-Mills theory is a non-trivial problem due to the presence of Gribov copies. In particular, there are different gauges in the non-perturbative regime which all correspond to the same definition of a gauge in the perturbative domain. Gauge-dependent correlation functions may differ in these gauges. Two such gauges are the minimal and absolute Landau gauge, both corresponding to the perturbative Landau gauge. These, and their numerical implementation, are described and presented in detail. Other choices will also be discussed. This investigation is performed, using numerical lattice gauge theory calculations, by comparing the propagators of gluons and ghosts for the minimal Landau gauge and the absolute Landau gauge in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. It is found that the propagators are different in the far infrared and even at energy scales of the order of half a GeV. In particular, also the finite-volume effects are modified. This is observed in two and three dimensions. Some remarks on the four-dimensional case are provided as well. 
0808.03048	On mean central limit theorems for stationary sequences	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Jérôme Dedecker, Emmanuel Rio	Abstract:  In this paper, we give estimates of the minimal ${\mathbb{L}}^1$ distance between the distribution of the normalized partial sum and the limiting Gaussian distribution for stationary sequences satisfying projective criteria in the style of Gordin or weak dependence conditions. 
0808.03049	Topological Summation of Observables Measured with Dynamical Overlap Fermions	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Wolfgang Bietenholz, Ivan Hip	Abstract:  HMC histories for light dynamical overlap fermions tend to stay in a fixed topological sector for many trajectories, so that the different sectors are not sampled properly. Therefore the suitable summation of observables, which have been measured in separate sectors, is a major challenge. We explore several techniques for this issue, based on data for the chiral condensate and the (analogue of the) pion mass in the 2-flavour Schwinger model with dynamical overlap-hypercube fermions. 
0808.03050	How Well a Chaotic Quantum System Can Retain Memory of Its Initial State?	Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)	Authors:Valentin V. Sokolov, Oleg V. Zhirov	Abstract:  In classical mechanics the local exponential instability effaces the memory of initial conditions and leads to practical irreversibility. In striking contrast, quantum mechanics appears to exhibit strong memory of the initial state. We relate the latter fact to the low (at most linear) rate with which the system's Wigner function gets during evolution more and more complicated structure and establish existence of a critical strength of external influence below which such a memory still survives. 
0808.03051	Global well-posedness of incompressible flow in porous media with critical diffusion in Besov spaces	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Baoquan Yuan, Jia Yuan	Abstract:  In this paper we study the model of heat transfer in a porous medium with a critical diffusion. We obtain global existence and uniqueness of solutions to the equations of heat transfer of incompressible fluid in Besov spaces $\dot B^{3/p}_{p,1}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ with $1\le p\le\infty$ by the method of modulus of continuity and Fourier localization technique. 
0808.03052	Kinks in a non-linear massive sigma model	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:A. Alonso-Izquierdo, M. A. Gonzalez Leon, J. Mateos Guilarte	Abstract:  We describe the kink solitary waves of a massive non-linear sigma model with an ${\mathbb S}^2$ sphere as the target manifold. Our solutions form a moduli space of non-relativistic solitary waves in the long wavelength limit of ferromagnetic linear spin chains. 
0808.03053	On the topological entropy of families of braids	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Toby Hall, S. Öykü Yurttas	Abstract:  A method for computing the topological entropy of each braid in an infinite family, making use of Dynnikov's coordinates on the boundary of Teichmüller space, is described. The method is illustrated on two two-parameter families of braids. 
0808.03054	Joint continuity of the local times of fractional Brownian sheets	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Antoine Ayache, Dongsheng Wu, Yimin Xiao	Abstract:  Let $B^H=\{B^H(t),t\in{\mathbb{R}_+^N}\}$ be an $(N,d)$-fractional Brownian sheet with index $H=(H_1,...,H_N)\in(0,1)^N$ defined by $B^H(t)=(B^H_1(t),...,B^H_d(t)) (t\in {\mathbb{R}}_+^N),$ where $B^H_1,...,B^H_d$ are independent copies of a real-valued fractional Brownian sheet $B_0^H$. We prove that if $d<\sum_{\ell=1}^NH_{\ell}^{-1}$, then the local times of $B^H$ are jointly continuous. This verifies a conjecture of Xiao and Zhang (Probab. Theory Related Fields 124 (2002)). We also establish sharp local and global Hölder conditions for the local times of $B^H$. These results are applied to study analytic and geometric properties of the sample paths of $B^H$. 
0808.03055	Minimal average degree aberration and the state polytope for experimental designs	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:Yael Berstein, Hugo Maruri-Aguilar, Shmuel Onn, Eva Riccomagno, Henry Wynn	Abstract:  For a particular experimental design, there is interest in finding which polynomial models can be identified in the usual regression set up. The algebraic methods based on Groebner bases provide a systematic way of doing this. The algebraic method does not in general produce all estimable models but it can be shown that it yields models which have minimal average degree in a well-defined sense and in both a weighted and unweighted version. This provides an alternative measure to that based on "aberration" and moreover is applicable to any experimental design. A simple algorithm is given and bounds are derived for the criteria, which may be used to give asymptotic Nyquist-like estimability rates as model and sample sizes increase. 
0808.03056	A quantized Tits-Kantor-Koecher algebra	Quantum Algebra (math.QA)	Authors:Yun Gao, Naihuan Jing	Abstract:  We propose a quantum analogue of a Tits-Kantor-Koecher algebra with a Jordan torus as an coordinated algebra by looking at the vertex operator construction over a Fock space. 
0808.03057	A note on the reduction of the AdS4 x CP3 string sigma model	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:R.C. Rashkov	Abstract:  We study the reduction of the (bosonic) string sigma model on $AdS_4\times\cp$ background. We give a brief presentation of the reduction procedure for $AdS$ part and apply explicitly the reduction scheme to $\cp$ part of the model. A brief discussion and directions for further study are presented. 
0808.03058	Evaluations of the twisted Alexander polynomials of 2-bridge knots at $\pm 1$	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Mikami Hirasawa (Nagoya Institute of Technology), Kunio Murasugi (University of Toronto)    	Abstract:  Let $H(p)$ be the set of 2-bridge knots $K$ whose group $G$ is mapped onto a non-trivial free product, $Z/2 * Z/p$, $p$ being odd. Then there is an algebraic integer $s_0$ such that for any $K$ in $H(p)$, $G$ has a parabolic representation $ρ$ into $SL(2, Z[s_0]) \subset SL(2,C)$. Let $Δ(t)$ be the twisted Alexander polynomial associated to $ρ$. Then we prove that for any $K$ in $H(p)$, $Δ(1)=-2s_0^{-1}$ and $Δ(-1)=-2s_0^{-1}μ^2$, where $s_0^{-1}, μ\in Z[s_0]$. The number $μ$ can be recursively evaluated. 
0808.03059	Compactons and Chaos in Strongly Nonlinear Lattices	Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)	Authors:Karsten Ahnert, Arkady Pikovsky	Abstract:  We study localized traveling waves and chaotic states in strongly nonlinear one-dimensional Hamiltonian lattices. We show that the solitary waves are super-exponentially localized, and present an accurate numerical method allowing to find them for an arbitrary nonlinearity index. Compactons evolve from rather general initially localized perturbations and collide nearly elastically, nevertheless on a long time scale for finite lattices an extensive chaotic state is generally observed. Because of the system's scaling, these dynamical properties are valid for any energy. 
0808.03060	Bohmian Mechanics at Space-Time Singularities. II. Spacelike Singularities	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Roderich Tumulka	Abstract:  We develop an extension of Bohmian mechanics by defining Bohm-like trajectories for quantum particles in a curved background space-time containing a spacelike singularity. As an example of such a metric we use the Schwarzschild metric, which contains two spacelike singularities, one in the past and one in the future. Since the particle world lines are everywhere timelike or lightlike, particles can be annihilated but not created at a future spacelike singularity, and created but not annihilated at a past spacelike singularity. It is argued that in the presence of future (past) spacelike singularities, there is a unique natural Bohm-like evolution law directed to the future (past). This law differs from the one in non-singular space-times mainly in two ways: it involves Fock space since the particle number is not conserved, and the wave function is replaced by a density matrix. In particular, we determine the evolution equation for the density matrix, a pure-to-mixed evolution equation of a quasi-Lindblad form. We have to leave open whether a curvature cut-off needs to be introduced for this equation to be well defined. 
0808.03061	Development of Anisotropy in Incompressible Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence	Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)	Authors:Barbara Bigot, Sebastien Galtier, Helene Politano	Abstract:  We present a set of three-dimensional (3D) direct numerical simulations of incompressible decaying magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in which we investigate the influence of an external uniform magnetic field B_0. A parametric study in terms of B_0 intensity is made where, in particular, we distinguish the shear- from the pseudo-Alfven waves dynamics. The initial kinetic and magnetic energies are equal with a negligible cross-correlation. Both the temporal and spectral effects of B_0 are discussed. A sub-critical balance is found between the Alfven and nonlinear times with both a global and a spectral definition. The nonlinear dynamics of strongly magnetized flows is characterized by a different k_perp-spectrum (where B_0 defines the parallel direction) if it is plotted at a fixed k_// (2D spectrum) or if it is integrated (averaged) over all k_// (1D spectrum). In the former case a much wider inertial range is found with a steep power law, closer to the wave turbulence prediction than the Kolmogorov one like in the latter case. It is believed that the averaging effect may be a source of difficulty to detect the transition towards wave turbulence in natural plasmas. For the first time, the formation of filaments is reported within current and vorticity sheets in strongly magnetized flows which modifies our classical picture of dissipative sheets in conductive flows. 
0808.03062	Dynamical symmetries in noncommutative theories	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Ricardo Amorim	Abstract:  In the present work we study dynamical space-time symmetries in noncommutative relativistic theories by using the minimal canonical extension of the Doplicher, Fredenhagen and Roberts algebra. Our formalism is constructed in an extended space-time with independent degrees of freedom associated with the object of noncommutativity $θ^{μν}$. In this framework we consider theories that are invariant under the Poincaré group ${\cal P}$ or under its extension ${\cal P}'$, when translations in the extra dimensions are permitted. The Noether's formalism adapted to such extended $x+θ$ space-time is employed. 
0808.03063	Ferromagnetism in transparent Mn(II)-doped indium tin oxide films prepared by sol-gel process	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Susmita Kundu, Dipten Bhattacharya, Jiten Ghosh, Pintu Das, Prasanta K. Biswas	Abstract:  We observe remarkably strong room temperature ferromagnetism (~1.5 Bohr Magneton/Mn) in optically transparent Mn(II)-doped indium tin oxide (ITO) films. The nanocrystalline films with average grain size 10-22 nm and thickness 150-350 nm are prepared by sol-gel coating technique on sodalime silica glass substrate. The ferromagnetic property is, of course, weak for films deposited on pure silica glass substrate. The structural parameters of the films appear to be governing the magnetic property strongly which vary appreciably depending on the substrate. The observation of room temperature ferromagnetism in transparent conducting ITO films may find a plethora of applications in the area of magneto-optics. 
0808.03064	On the problem of Unicity in Einstein-Sciama-Kibble Theory	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Luca Fabbri	Abstract:  We consider the ESK theory, based on the principle for which the space is filled with matter fields in such a way that Cartan torsion is spin; in the geometry in which Cartan torsion tensor is completely antisymmetric, spin has to be completely antisymmetric: we will show how the complete antisymmetry of spin constraints the form of possible matter field theories as to allow the special case of the simplest one solely, all other most general cases being excluded. 
0808.03065	Automatic generation of Feynman rules in the Schroedinger functional	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Shinji Takeda	Abstract:  We provide an algorithm to generate vertices for the Schrödinger functional with an abelian background gauge field. The background field has a non-trivial color structure, therefore we mainly focus on a manipulation of the color matrix part. We propose how to implement the algorithm especially in python code. By using python outputs produced by the code, we also show how to write a numerical expression of vertices in the time-momentum as well as the coordinate space into a Feynman diagram calculation code. As examples of the applications of the algorithm, we provide some one-loop results, ratios of the Lambda parameters between the plaquette gauge action and the improved gauge actions composed from six-link loops (rectangular, chair and parallelogram), the determination of the O(a) boundary counter term to this order, and the perturbative cutoff effects of the step scaling function of the Schroedinger functional coupling constant. 
0808.03066	First Passage Time Distribution and Number of Returns for Ultrametric Random Walk	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:V. A. Avetisov, A. Kh. Bikulov, A. P. Zubarev	Abstract:  In this paper, we consider a homogeneous Markov process ξ(t;ω) on an ultrametric space Q_p, with distribution density f(x,t), x in Q_p, t in R_+, satisfying the ultrametric diffusion equation df(x,t)/dt =-Df(x,t). We construct and examine a random variable τ(ω) that has the meaning the first passage times. Also, we obtain a formula for the mean number of returns on the interval (0,t] and give its asymptotic estimates for large t. 
0808.03067	Higher-derivative 3-algebras	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Mohsen Alishahiha, Sunil Mukhi	Abstract:  Starting with the N=8 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on D2-branes and incorporating higher-derivative corrections to lowest nontrivial order, we perform a duality to derive the Lorentzian 3-algebra theory along with a set of derivative corrections. We find that these corrections can be expressed entirely in terms of intrinsic 3-algebra quantities: the 3-bracket and covariant derivatives. Our analysis is performed for both bosonic and fermionic terms. We conjecture that the derivative corrections we obtain are relevant for Euclidean 3-algebra theories as well. 
0808.03068	Quantifying and containing the curse of high resolution coronal imaging	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Véronique Delouille, Pierre Chainais, Jean-François Hochedez	Abstract:  Future missions such as Solar Orbiter (SO), InterHelioprobe, or Solar Probe aim at approaching the Sun closer than ever before, with on board some high resolution imagers (HRI) having a subsecond cadence and a pixel area of about $(80km)^2$ at the Sun during perihelion. In order to guarantee their scientific success, it is necessary to evaluate if the photon counts available at these resolution and cadence will provide a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We perform a first step in this direction by analyzing and characterizing the spatial intermittency of Quiet Sun images thanks to a multifractal analysis. We identify the parameters that specify the scale-invariance behavior. This identification allows next to select a family of multifractal processes, namely the Compound Poisson Cascades, that can synthesize artificial images having some of the scale-invariance properties observed on the recorded images. The prevalence of self-similarity in Quiet Sun coronal images makes it relevant to study the ratio between the SNR present at SoHO/EIT images and in coarsened images. SoHO/EIT images thus play the role of 'high resolution' images, whereas the 'low-resolution' coarsened images are rebinned so as to simulate a smaller angular resolution and/or a larger distance to the Sun. For a fixed difference in angular resolution and in Spacecraft-Sun distance, we determine the proportion of pixels having a SNR preserved at high resolution given a particular increase in effective area. If scale-invariance continues to prevail at smaller scales, the conclusion reached with SoHO/EIT images can be transposed to the situation where the resolution is increased from SoHO/EIT to SO/HRI resolution at perihelion. 
0808.03069	Uniform deterministic equivalent of additive functionals and non-parametric drift estimation for one-dimensional recurrent diffusions	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:D. Loukianova, O. Loukianov	Abstract:  Usually the problem of drift estimation for a diffusion process is considered under the hypothesis of ergodicity. It is less often considered under the hypothesis of null-recurrence, simply because there are fewer limit theorems and existing ones do not apply to the whole null-recurrent class. The aim of this paper is to provide some limit theorems for additive functionals and martingales of a general (ergodic or null) recurrent diffusion which would allow us to have a somewhat unified approach to the problem of non-parametric kernel drift estimation in the one-dimensional recurrent case. As a particular example we obtain the rate of convergence of the Nadaraya--Watson estimator in the case of a locally Hölder-continuous drift. 
0808.03070	Near band-edge luminescence of semi-insulating undoped gallium arsenide at high levels of excitation	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:V.F. Kovalenko, S.V. Shutov, Ye.A. Baganov, M.M. Smyikalo	Abstract:  The dependences of the maximum and the half-width of near band-edge photoluminescence of semi-insulating undoped GaAs crystals at 77K on the concentration of background acceptor impurities and the level of excitation in the range from 3x1021 to 6x1022 quantum/(cm2/s) are investigated. The observed dependences are explained by formation of the density tails of states as a result of fluctuations of impurity concentration and participation of localized states of the donor impurity band in radiative transitions. Reduction of many-particle interaction at increasing of N can be connected with increasing of shielding of charge carriers by atoms of impurity. 
0808.03071	No quasi-long-range order in the two-dimensional liquid crystal	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Ricardo Paredes, Ana-Isabel Fariñas-Sánchez, Robert Botet	Abstract:  Systems with global symmetry group O(2) experience topological transition in the 2-dimensional space. But there is controversy about such a transition for systems with global symmetry group O(3). In this paper, we study the Lebwohl-Lasher model for the two-dimensional liquid crystal, using three different methods independent of the proper values of possible critical exponents. Namely, we analyze the at-equilibrium order parameter distribution function with: 1) the hyperscaling relation; 2) the first scaling collapse for the probability distribution function;and 3) the Binder's cumulant. We give strong evidences for definite lack of a line of critical points at low temperatures in the Lebwohl-Lasher model, contrary to conclusions of a number of previous numerical studies. 
0808.03072	A theory of hierarchical consequence and conditionals	Logic (math.LO)	Authors:Dov Gabbay (LIF), Karl Schlechta (LIF)    	Abstract:  We introduce A-ranked preferential structures and combine them with an accessibility relation. This framework allows us to formalize contrary to duty obligations. Representation results are proved. 
0808.03073	Roadmap for preferential logics	Logic (math.LO)	Authors:Dov Gabbay (LIF), Karl Schlechta (LIF)    	Abstract:  We give an overview of logical and semantical rules for nonmonotonic and related logics. 
0808.03074	Light-bending in Schwarzschild-de-Sitter: projective geometry of the optical metric	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:G.W. Gibbons, C.M. Warnick, M.C. Werner	Abstract:  We interpret the well known fact that the equations for light rays in the Kottler or Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric are independent of the cosmological constant in terms of the projective equivalence of the optical metric for any value of Λ. We explain why this does not imply that lensing phenomena are independent of Λ. Motivated by this example, we find a large collection of one-parameter families of projectively equivalent metrics including both the Kottler optical geometry and the constant curvature metrics as special cases. Using standard constructions for geodesically equivalent metrics we find classical and quantum conserved quantities and relate these to known quantities. 
0808.03075	Reactive preferential structures and nonmonotonic consequence	Logic (math.LO)	Authors:Dov Gabbay (LIF), Karl Schlechta (LIF)    	Abstract:  We introduce information bearing systems (IBRS) as an abstraction of many logical systems. We define a general semantics for IBRS, and show that IBRS generalize in a natural way preferential semantics and solve open representation problems. 
0808.03076	Phase behavior of C18 monoglyceride in hydrophobic solutions	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:C.H. Chen, I. Van Damme, E.M. Terentjev	Abstract:  We apply a set of different techniques to analyze the physical properties and phase transitions of monoglycerides (MG) in oil. In contrast to many studies of MG in water or aqueous systems, we find a significant difference in the phase structure at different concentrations and temperatures. By adding small quantities of water to our base MG/oil systems we test the effect of hydration of surfactant head-groups, and its effect on the phase behavior. The phase diagrams are determined by calorimetry and their universal features are recorded under different conditions. Two ordered phases are reported: the inverse lamellar gel phase and the sub-alpha crystalline gel phase. This sequence is very different from the structures in MG/water; its most striking feature is the establishing of a 2D densely packed hexagonal order of glycerol heads in the middle of inverse lamellar bilayers. Rheology was examined through temperature scans to demonstrate the gelation phenomenon, which starts from the onset of the lamellar phase during the cooling/ordering process. 
0808.03077	Cumulativity without closure of the domain under finite unions	Logic (math.LO)	Authors:Dov Gabbay (LIF), Karl Schlechta (LIF)    	Abstract:  For nonmonotonic logics, Cumulativity is an important rule. We show here that Cumulativity fans out into an infinity of different conditions, if the domain is not closed under finite unions. 
0808.03078	Decoration invariants for horseshoe braids	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:André de Carvalho, Toby Hall	Abstract:  The Decoration Conjecture describes the structure of the set of braid types of Smale's horseshoe map ordered by forcing, providing information about the order in which periodic orbits can appear when a horseshoe is created. A proof of this conjecture is given for the class of so-called lone decorations, and it is explained how to calculate associated braid conjugacy invariants which provide additional information about forcing for horseshoe braids. 
0808.03079	Stau LSP Phenomenology: Two- versus Four-Body Decay Modes and Resonant Single Slepton Production at the LHC as an Example	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:H.K. Dreiner, S. Grab, M.K. Trenkel	Abstract:  We investigate B3 mSUGRA models, where the lightest scalar tau, stau_1, is the LSP. B3 models allow for lepton number and R-parity violation; the LSP can thus decay. We assume one non-zero B3 coupling lambda'_ijk at M_GUT, which generates further B3 couplings at M_Z. We study the RGEs and give numerical examples. The new couplings lead to additional stau_1 decays, providing distinct collider signatures. We classify the stau_1 decays and describe their dependence on the mSUGRA parameters. We exploit our results for single slepton production at the LHC. As an explicit numerical example, we investigate single smuon production, focussing on like-sign dimuons in the final state. Also considered are final states with three or four muons. 
0808.03080	Modeling of quasiparticle-induced excitations of a Josephson charge-phase qubit	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:J. Könemann, H. Zangerle, B. Egeling, R. Harke, B. Mackrodt, R. Dolata, A. B. Zorin	Abstract:  We have analyzed quasiparticle transitions in an Al charge-phase qubit inducing a dynamic change of the qubit states. The time-averaged mixed state is related to the strong coupling of the qubit to an ensemble of non-equilibrium quasiparticles in the leads. Such quasiparticles tunnel stochastically on and off the island and can excite the qubit. Continuous monitoring of the qubit impedance at a frequency of 80 MHz shows the admixture of the excited state. We present a numerical description of these cyclic transitions and compare it with our experimental data. 
0808.03081	Isomonodromic deformatiion with an irregular singularity and hyperelliptic curve	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Kazuhide Matsuda	Abstract:  In this paper, we extend the result of Kitaev and Korotkin to the case where a monodromy-preserving deformation has an irregular singularity. For the monodromy-preserving deformation, we obtain the $τ$-function whose deformation parameters are the positions of regular singularities and the parameter $t$ of an irregular singularity. Furthermore, the $τ$-function is expressed by the hyperelliptic $Θ$ function moving the argument $\z$ and the period $\B,$ where $t$ and the positions of regular singularities move $z$ and $\B,$ respectively. 
0808.03082	Unitarity corrections from the high energy QCD effective action	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Martin Hentschinski	Abstract:  We investigate the derivation of reggeon transition vertices from Lipatov's gauge invariant effective action for high energy processes in QCD. In particular we address the question of longitudinal integrations in order to reduce the vertices into the required purely transverse form. We explicitly derive the BFKL-kernel and verify vanishing of the 2-to-3 reggeon transition vertex. First results on the derivation of the 2-to-4 reggeon transition vertex are discussed. 
0808.03083	Identical particles are indistinguishable but..	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Alberto C. de la Torre, Hector O. Martin	Abstract:  It is shown that quantum systems of identical particles can be treated as if they were different when they are in well differentiated states. This simplifying assumption allows the consideration of quantum systems isolated from the rest of the universe and justifies many intuitive statements about identical systems. However, it is shown that this simplification may lead to wrong results in the calculation of the entropy. Keywords: quantum mechanics, identical systems, entropy 
0808.03084	Aging and metastability of monoglycerides in hydrophobic solutions	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:C.H. Chen, E.M. Terentjev	Abstract:  The aging of aggregated structures of monoglycerides in hydrophobic medium is described by a set of different techniques. Polarized microscopy was used to study the mesomorphic behavior as a function of time. Differential scanning calorimetry was utilized to quantitatively monitor changes in the latent heat in different phase transformations that take place in the aging system. Infrared spectroscopy was applied to detect the formation of hydrogen bonding between surfactants. The X-ray diffraction patterns fingerprinted the molecular arrangement in different emerging phases. Infra-red spectroscopy was used to monitor the state of hydrogen bonding in the system. We conclude that in both inverted-lamellar and sub-alpha crystalline phases, monoglyceride molecules inevitably lose their emulsified ability in the hydrophobic solutions through the gradual change in hydrogen bonding patterns. On aging, the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between glycerol groups causes the segregation of chiral (D and L) isomers within the bilayers. Therefore all structures were eventually forced to reorder into the beta-crystalline state, distinguishing between the D and L layers. Accordingly, the highly ordered packing of aged structures weakened the emulsifying ability and finally leaded the collapse of the percolating gel network. 
0808.03085	Monitoring Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients with Swift. III. Outbursts of the prototypical SFXTs IGR J17544-2619 and XTE J1739-302	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:L.Sidoli (1), P.Romano (2), V.Mangano (2), G.Cusumano (2), S.Vercellone (1), J.A.Kennea (3), A.Paizis (1), H.A. Krimm (4,5), D.N.Burrows (3), N.Gehrels (6) ((1)-INAF-IASF Milano, Italy, (2)-INAF-IASF Palermo, Italy (3)-PSU, University Park, USA (4)-CRESST/Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, USA (5) Universities Space Research Association, Columbia, USA, (6)- NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, USA)    	Abstract:  IGR J17544-2619 and XTE J1739-302 are considered the prototypical sources of the new class of High Mass X-ray Binaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs).These sources were observed during bright outbursts on 2008 March 31 and 2008 April 8, respectively, thanks to an on-going monitoring campaign we are performing with Swift, started in October 2007. Simultaneous observations with XRT and BAT allowed us to perform for the first time a broad band spectroscopy of their outbursts. The X-ray emission is well reproduced with absorbed cutoff powerlaws, similar to the typical spectral shape from accreting pulsars. IGR J17544-2619 shows a significantly harder spectrum during the bright flare (where a luminosity in excess of 1E36 erg/s is reached) than during the long-term low level flaring activity (1E33-1E34 erg/s), while XTE J1739-302 displayed the same spectral shape, within the uncertainties, and a higher column density during the flare than in the low level activity. The light curves of these two SFXTs during the bright flare look similar to those observed during recent flares from other two SFXTs, IGRJ11215-5952 and IGRJ16479-4514, reinforcing the connection among the members of this class of X-ray sources. 
0808.03086	Nonbinary Codeword Stabilized Quantum Codes	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Xie Chen, Bei Zeng, Isaac L. Chuang	Abstract:  The codeword stabilized (CWS) quantum codes formalism presents a unifying approach to both additive and nonadditive quantum error-correcting codes (arXiv:0708.1021 [quant-ph]), but only for binary states. Here we generalize the CWS framework to the nonbinary case (of both prime and nonprime dimension) and map the search for nonbinary quantum codes to a corresponding search problem for classical nonbinary codes with specific error patterns. We show that while the additivity properties of nonbinary CWS codes are similar to the binary case, the structural properties of the nonbinary codes differ substantially from the binary case, even for prime dimensions. In particular, we identify specific structure patterns of stabilizer groups, based on which efficient constructions might be possible for codes that encode more dimensions than any stabilizer codes of the same length and distance; similar methods cannot be applied in the binary case. Understanding of these structural properties can help prune the search space and facilitate the identification of good nonbinary CWS codes. 
0808.03087	Noise in random Boolean networks	Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)	Authors:Tiago P. Peixoto, Barbara Drossel	Abstract:  We investigate the effect of noise on Random Boolean Networks. Noise is implemented as a probability $p$ that a node does not obey its deterministic update rule. We define two order parameters, the long-time average of the Hamming distance between a network with and without noise, and the average frozenness, which is a measure of the extent to which a node prefers one of the two Boolean states. We evaluate both order parameters as function of the noise strength, finding a smooth transition from deterministic ($p=0$) to fully stochastic ($p=1/2$) dynamics for networks with $K\le2$, and a first order transition at $p=0$ for $K>2$. Most of the results obtained by computer simulation are also derived analytically. The average Hamming distance can be evaluated using the annealed approximation. In order to obtain the distribution of frozenness as function of the noise strength, more sophisticated self-consistent calculations had to be performed. This distribution is a collection of delta peaks for K=1, and it has a fractal sructure for $K>1$, approaching a continuous distribution in the limit $K\gg1$. 
0808.03088	Pairing of Supermassive Black Holes in unequal-mass mergers	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Callegari, L. Mayer, S. Kazantzidis	Abstract:  Disk galaxies with a spheroidal component are known to host Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) in their center. Unequal-mass galaxy mergers have been rarely studied despite the fact that they are the large majority of merging events by number and they are associated with the typical targets of gravitational wave experiments such as LISA. We performed N-body/SPH simulations of disk galaxy mergers with mass ratios 1:4 and 1:10 at redshifts z=0 and z=3. They have the highest resolution achieved so far for merging galaxies, and include star formation and supernova feedback. Gas dissipation is found to be necessary for the pairing of SMBHs in these minor mergers. Still, 1:10 mergers with gas allow an efficient pairing only at high z when orbital times are short enough compared to the Hubble time. 
0808.03089	Survey of Hopf fibrations and rotation conventions in mathematics and physics	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:David W. Lyons	Abstract:  We present a unifying framework for understanding several different versions of the Hopf fibration, and use this framework to reconcile two methods of representing rotations of 3-space by unitary matrices--the mathematician's convention based on quaternion algebra, and the physicist's convention based on the Bloch sphere. 
0808.03090	Complex Cooperative Behaviour in Range-free Frustrated Many-body Systems	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:David Sherrington	Abstract:  A brief introduction and overview is given of the complexity that is possible and the challenges its study poses in many-body systems in which spatial dimension is irrelevant and naively one might have expected trivial behaviour. 
0808.03091	Spectral properties of quasi-one-dimensional conductors with a finite transverse band dispersion	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Z Bonacic Losic, A Bjelis, P Zupanovic	Abstract:  We determine the one-particle spectral function and the corresponding derived quantities for the conducting chain lattice with the finite inter-chain hopping $t_\perp$ and the three-dimensional long-range Coulomb electron-electron interaction. The standard $G_{0}W_{0}$ approximation is used. It is shown that, due to the optical character of the anisotropic plasmon dispersion caused by the finite $t_\perp$, the low energy quasi-particle $δ$-peak appears in the spectral function in addition to the hump present at the energies of the order of plasmon energy. The particular attention is devoted to the continuous cross-over from the non-Fermi liquid to the Fermi liquid regime by increasing $t_\perp$. It is shown that the spectral weight of the hump transfers to the quasi-particle as the optical gap in the plasmon dispersion increases together with $t_\perp$, with the quasi-particle residuum $Z$ behaving like $- (\ln t_{\perp})^{-1}$ in the limit $t_{\perp}\to 0$. Our approach is appropriate for the wide range of energy scales given by the plasmon energy and the width of the conduction band, and is complementary to the Luttinger liquid techniques that are limited to the low energy regime close to the Fermi surface. 
0808.03092	Collisionless relaxation in gravitational systems: From violent relaxation to gravothermal collapse	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Yan Levin, Renato Pakter, Felipe B. Rizzato	Abstract:  Theory and simulations are used to study collisionless relaxation of a gravitational $N$-body system. It is shown that when the initial one particle distribution function satisfies the virial condition -- potential energy is minus twice the kinetic energy -- the system quickly relaxes to a metastable state described {\it quantitatively} by the Lynden-Bell distribution with a cutoff. If the initial distribution function does not meet the virial requirement, the system undergoes violent oscillations, resulting in a partial evaporation of mass. The leftover particles phase separate into a core-halo structure. The theory presented allows us to quantitatively predict the amount and the distribution of mass left in the central core, without any adjustable parameters. On a longer time scale $τ_G \sim N$ collisionless relaxation leads to a gravothermal collapse. 
0808.03093	Searching for Very-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Bursts from Evaporating Primordial Black Holes	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:V.B. Petkov, E.V. Bugaev, P.A. Klimai, M.V. Andreev, V.I. Volchenko, G.V. Volchenko, A.N. Gaponenko, Zh.Sh. Guliev, I.M. Dzaparova, D.V. Smirnov, A.V. Sergeev, A.B. Chernyaev, A.F. Yanin	Abstract:  Temporal and energy characteristics of the very-high-energy gamma-ray bursts from evaporating primordial black holes have been calculated by assuming that the photospheric and chromospheric effects are negligible. The technique of searching for such bursts on shower arrays is described. We show that the burst time profile and the array dead time should be taken into account to interpret experimental data. Based on data from the Andyrchy array of the Baksan Neutrino Observatory (Institute for Nuclear Research, Russian Academy of Sciences), we have obtained an upper limit on the number density of evaporating primordial black holes in a local region of space with a scale size of ~10^{-3} pc. Comparison with the results of previous experiments is made. 
0808.03094	Search for Higgs Bosons in SUSY Cascades in CMS and Dark Matter with Non-universal Gaugino Masses	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Katri Huitu, Ritva Kinnunen, Jari Laamanen, Sami Lehti, Sourov Roy, Tapio Salminen	Abstract:  In grand unified theories (GUT), non-universal boundary conditions for the gaugino masses may arise at the unification scale, and affect the observability of the neutral MSSM Higgs bosons (h/H/A) at the LHC. The implications of such non-universal gaugino masses are investigated for the Higgs boson production in the SUSY cascade decay chain gluino --> squark quark, squark --> neutralino_2 quark, neutralino_2 --> neutralino_1 h/H/A, h/H/A --> b b-bar produced in pp interactions. In the singlet representation with universal gaugino masses only the light Higgs boson can be produced in this cascade with the parameter region of interest for us, while with non-universal gaugino masses heavy neutral MSSM Higgs boson production may dominate. The allowed parameter space in the light of the WMAP constraints on the cold dark matter relic density is investigated in the above scenarios for gaugino mass parameters. We also demonstrate that combination of representations can give the required amount of dark matter in any point of the parameter space. In the non-universal case we show that heavy Higgs bosons can be detected in the studied cascade in parameter regions with the WMAP preferred neutralino relic density. 
0808.03095	Graphene quantum dots: Beyond a Dirac billiard	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:F. Libisch, C. Stampfer, J. Burgdörfer	Abstract:  We present realistic simulations of quantum confinement effects in ballistic graphene quantum dots with linear dimensions of 10 to 40 nm. We determine wavefunctions and energy level statistics in the presence of disorder resulting from edge roughness, charge impurities, or short-ranged scatterers. Marked deviations from a simple Dirac billiard for massless fermions are found. We find a remarkably stable dependence of the nearest-neighbor level spacing on edge roughness suggesting that the roughness of fabricated devices can be potentially characterized by the distribution of measured Coulomb blockade peaks. 
0808.03096	Fragmentation of Positronium (Ps) in collision with Li ion	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:S. Roy, C. Sinha	Abstract:  Fragmentation of ground state ortho Positronium (Ps) in collision with Li ion (Li+) is studied in the framework of post collisional Coulomb distorted eikonal approximation (CDEA) for the target elastic case . The present model takes account of the two center effect on the ejected e which is crucial for a proper description of the projectile ionization involving an ionic target. Both the fully differential (TDCS) and the doubly differential (DDCS) cross sections (energy spectra) are investigated at intermediate and high incident energies. A broad distinct Electron loss peak (ELP) centered around v_e ~ v_p is noted in the e energy spectrum in contrast to the sharp ELP for a heavy projectile. Two salient features are noted in the present study: i) the shift of the e DDCS peak (summed over e+ angles) towards higher ejection energy with respect to half the residual energy of the system, ii) comparison of the e& e+ energy spectra reflect a strong e - e+ asymmetry with respect to the ratio v_e/v_p =1 >. Both these features could be attributed to the post collisional two center effect on the e due to its parent nucleus (e+) and the screened target ion . Two different wave functions of the Li ion are chosen in order to test the sensitivity of the present results with respect to the choice of the wave function. 
0808.03097	Hadronic Momentum Densities in the Transverse Plane	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Zainul Abidin, Carl E. Carlson (William and Mary)    	Abstract:  We examine the spatial density within extended objects of the momentum component $p^+$, and find relativistically exact connections to Fourier transforms of gravitational form factors. We apply these results to obtain semi-empirical momentum density distributions within nucleons, and similar distributions for spin-1 objects based on theoretical results from the AdS/QCD correspondence. We find that the momentum density in the transverse plane is more compact than the charge density. 
0808.03098	Global Smooth Effects and Well-Posedness for the Derivative Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation with Small Rough Data	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Wang Baoxiang, Han Lijia, Huang Chunyan	Abstract:  \rm We obtain the global smooth effects for the solutions of the linear Schrödinger equation in anisotropic Lebesgue spaces. Applying these estimates, we study the Cauchy problem for the generalized elliptical and non-elliptical derivative nonlinear Schrödinger equations (DNLS) and get the global well posedness of solutions with small data in modulation spaces $M^{3/2}_{2,1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$. Noticing that $H^{\tilde{s}} \subset M^s_{2,1}$ $(\tilde{s}-s>n/2)$ is an optimal inclusion, we have shown the global well posedness of DNLS with a class of very rough data. 
0808.03099	Minimal models for proteins and RNA: From folding to function	Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)	Authors:D. L. Pincus, S. S. Cho, C. Hyeon, D. Thirumalai	Abstract:  We present a panoramic view of the utility of coarse-grained (CG) models to study folding and functions of proteins and RNA. Drawing largely on the methods developed in our group over the last twenty years, we describe a number of key applications ranging from folding of proteins with disulfide bonds to functions of molecular machines. After presenting the theoretical basis that justifies the use of CG models, we explore the biophysical basis for the emergence of a finite number of folds from lattice models. The lattice model simulations of approach to the folded state show that non-native interactions are relevant only early in the folding process - a finding that rationalizes the success of structure-based models that emphasize native interactions. Applications of off-lattice $C_α$ and models that explicitly consider side chains ($C_α$-SCM) to folding of $β$-hairpin and effects of macromolecular crowding are briefly discussed. Successful application of a new class of off-lattice model, referred to as the Self-Organized Polymer (SOP), is shown by describing the response of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to mechanical force. The utility of the SOP model is further illustrated by applications that clarify the functions of the chaperonin GroEL and motion of the molecular motor kinesin. We also present two distinct models for RNA, namely, the Three Site Interaction (TIS) model and the SOP model, that probe forced unfolding and force quench refolding of a simple hairpin and {\it Azoarcus} ribozyme. The predictions based on the SOP model show that force-induced unfolding pathways of the ribozyme can be dramatically changed by varying the loading rate. We conclude with a discussion of future prospects for the use of coarse-grained models in addressing problems of outstanding interest in biology.

0808.03101	QCD at Non-Zero Density : Lattice Results	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:M. P. Lombardo	Abstract:  A concise review of the progress of lattice calculations at non-zero density since QM2006 is given, with emphasis on the high baryon density, low temperature domain. Possibilities for exploring densities higher than those studied by standard techniques are analysed. The phase transitions of cold, dense matter, where the sign problem remains severe, are discussed in the context of QCD-like models and approximations to QCD. 
0808.03102	Heavy Coronal Ions in the Heliosphere: I. Global Distribution of Charge-states of C, N, O, Mg, Si and S	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Grzedzielski (1), M.E. Wachowicz (1), M. Bzowski (1), V. Izmodenov (2) ((1) Space Research Centre PAS, Warsaw, Poland) ((2) Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia)    	Abstract:  Aims: Investigate/Study de-charging of solar wind C, N, O, Mg, Si and S ions and assess fluxes of resulting ENA in the heliosphere. Methods: The model treats the heavy ions as test particles convected by (and in a particular case also diffusing through) a hydrodynamically calculated background plasma flow, from 1 AU to the termination shock (TS), to heliosheath (HS) and finally to heliospheric tail (HT). The ions undergo radiative and dielectronic recombinations, charge exchanges, photo- and electron impact ionizations with plasma particles, interstellar neutral atoms (calculated on a Monte-Carlo model) and solar photons. Results: Highly-charged heavy coronal ions flowing with the solar wind undergo successive de-ionizations, mainly in the heliosheath, leading to charge-states much lower than in the supersonic solar wind. If Coulomb scattering is the main ion energy loss mechanism, the end product of these deionizations are fluxes of ENA of ~1 keV/nucleon originating in the upwind heliosheath that for C, Mg, Si and S may constitute sources of pickup ions (PUI) significantly exceeding the interstellar supply. Conclusions: Discussed processes result in (i) distinct difference of ion charge q in the supersonic solar wind (approximately q >= +Z/2, Z = atomic number) compared to that in the HS (approximately 0 <= q <= +Z/2)), (ii) probable concentration of singly ionized atoms (q = +1) in the heliosheath towards the heliopause (HP) and in the HT, (iii) possible significant production of ENA in the HS offering natural explanation for production of PUI, and -- after acceleration at the TS -- anomalous cosmic rays (ACR) of species (like C, Mg, Si, S) unable to enter the heliospheric cavity from outside because of their total ionization in the local interstellar medium.

0808.03104	Phases and magnetization process of an anisotropic Shastry-Sutherland model	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Zi Yang Meng, Stefan Wessel	Abstract:  We examine ground state properties of the spin-1/2 easy-axis Heisenberg model on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice with ferromagnetic transverse spin exchange using quantum Monte Carlo and degenerate perturbation theory. For vanishing transverse exchange, the model reduces to an antiferromagnetic Ising model that besides Neel order harbors regions of extensive ground state degeneracy. In the quantum regime, we find a dimerized phase of triplet states, separated from the Neel ordered phase by a superfluid. The quantum phase transitions between these phases are characterized. The magnetization process shows a magnetization plateau at 1/3 of the saturation value, that persists down to the Ising limit, and a further plateau at 1/2 only in the quantum regime. For both plateaus, we determine the crystalline patterns of the localized triplet excitations. No further plateaus nor supersolid phases are found in this model. 
0808.03105	Some properties of multivariate measures of concordance	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:M. D. Taylor	Abstract:  We explore the consequences of a set of axioms which extend Scarsini's axioms for bivariate measures of concordance to the multivariate case and exhibit the following results: (1) A method of extending measures of concordance from the bivariate case to arbitrarily high dimensions. (2) A formula expressing the measure of concordance of the random vectors $(\pm X_1,...,\pm X_n)$ in terms of the measures of concordance of the "marginal" random vectors $(X_{i_1},...,X_{i_k})$. (3) A method of expressing the measure of concordance of an odd-dimensional copula in terms of the measures of concordance of its even-dimensional marginals. (4) A family of relations which exist between the measures of concordance of the marginals of a given copula. 
0808.03106	A simple parameter-free one-center model potential for an effective one-electron description of molecular hydrogen	Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)	Authors:Armin Lühr, Yulian V. Vanne, Alejandro Saenz	Abstract:  For the description of an H2 molecule an effective one-electron model potential is proposed which is fully determined by the exact ionization potential of the H2 molecule. In order to test the model potential and examine its properties it is employed to determine excitation energies, transition moments, and oscillator strengths in a range of the internuclear distances, 0.8 < R < 2.5 a.u. In addition, it is used as a description of an H2 target in calculations of the cross sections for photoionization and for partial excitation in collisions with singly-charged ions. The comparison of the results obtained with the model potential with literature data for H2 molecules yields a good agreement and encourages therefore an extended usage of the potential in various other applications or in order to consider the importance of two-electron and anisotropy effects. 
0808.03107	Strong electronic correlations in Li$_x$ZnPc organic metals	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:M. Filibian (1), P. Carretta (1), M. C. Mozzati (1), P. Ghigna (1), G. Zoppellaro (2), M. Ruben (2) ((1) University of Pavia, Italy, (2) Institut fur Nanotechnologie, Karlsruhe, Germany)    	Abstract:  Nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance and magnetization measurements show that bulk Li$_x$ZnPc are strongly correlated one-dimensional metals. The temperature dependence of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ and of the static uniform susceptibility $χ_S$ on approaching room temperature are characteristic of a Fermi liquid. Moreover, while for $x\simeq 2$ the electrons are delocalized down to low temperature, for $x\to 4$ a tendency towards localization is noticed upon cooling, yielding an increase both in $1/T_1$ and $χ_s$. The $x$-dependence of the effective density of states at the Fermi level $D(E_F)$ displays a sharp enhancement for $x\simeq 2$, at the half filling of the ZnPc lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals. This suggests that Li$_x$ZnPc is on the edge of a metal-insulator transition where enhanced superconducting fluctuations could develop. 
0808.03108	A tangential force model for interactions between bonded colloidal particles	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Volker Becker, Heiko Briesen	Abstract:  Recently, Pantina and Furst (Phys. Rev. Lett., 94(13), 138301, 2005) experimentally demon- strated that there are tangential forces between bonded colloidal particles and that bonds between colloidal particles are capable of supporting bending moments. We introduce a model to be used in computer simulations that describes these tangential interactions. We show how the model parame- ters can be determined from experimental data. Simulations using the model are able to reproduce the measurement of Pantina and Furst. Application of the model to an aggregate with fractal structure leads to more realistic behavior than using classical approaches only. 
0808.03109	n-ary Fuzzy Logic and Neutrosophic Logic Operators	Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)	Authors:Florentin Smarandache, V. Christianto	Abstract:  We extend Knuth's 16 Boolean binary logic operators to fuzzy logic and neutrosophic logic binary operators. Then we generalize them to n-ary fuzzy logic and neutrosophic logic operators using the smarandache codification of the Venn diagram and a defined vector neutrosophic law. In such way, new operators in neutrosophic logic/set/probability are built. 
0808.03110	Production at High $p_T$ in Central Au+Au and $p+p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} = 200$ GeV in STAR	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:P. Fachini (for the STAR collaboration)    	Abstract:  he $ρ^0$ production at high-$p_T$ (5.0 $\leq p_T \leq$ 10.0 GeV/$c$) measured in minimum bias $p+p$, Au+Au and central Au+Au collisions in the STAR detector are presented. The $ρ^0/π$ ratio measured in $p+p$ is compared to PYTHIA calculations as a test of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) that describes reasonably well particle production from hard processes. The $ρ^0$ nuclear modification factor are also presented. In $p+p$ collisions, charged pions and (anti-)protons are measured in the range 5.0 $\leq p_T \leq$ 15.0 GeV/$c$ and the anti-particle to particle ratio and the baryon to meson ratios of these hadrons are discussed. 
0808.03111	The Evolution Of Carbon, Sulphur, and Titanium Isotopes from High-Redshift to the Local Universe	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:G.L. Hughes (1), B.K. Gibson (1), L. Carigi (1,2), P. Sanchez-Blazquez (1), J.M.Chavez (3), D.L. Lambert (3) ((1) University of Central Lancashire, (2) Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, (3) University of Texas)    	Abstract:  Recent observations of carbon, sulphur, and titanium isotopes at redshifts z~1 and in the local stellar disc and halo have opened a new window into the study of isotopic abundance patterns and the origin of the chemical elements. Using our Galactic chemical evolution code GEtool, we have examined the evolution of these isotopes within the framework of a Milky Way-like system. We have three aims in this work: first, to test the claim that novae are required, in order to explain the carbon isotope patterns in the Milky Way; second, to test the claim that sulphur isotope patterns at high-redshift require an initial mass function biased towards massive stars; and third, to test extant chemical evolution models against new observations of titanium isotopes that suggest an anti-correlation between trace-to-dominant isotopes with metallicity. Based upon our dual-infall galactic chemical evolution modelling of a Milky Way-like system, and the subsequent comparison with these new and unique datasets, we conclude the following: novae are not required to understand the evolution of 12C/13C in the solar neighbourhood; a massive star-biased initial mass function is consistent with the low ratios of 12C/13C and 32S/34S seen in one high-redshift late-type spiral, but the consequent super-solar metallicity prediction for the interstellar medium in this system seems highly unlikely; and deficient isotopes of titanium are predicted to correlate positively with metallicity, in apparent disagreement with the new datasets; if confirmed, classical chemical evolution models of the Milky Way (and the associated supernovae nucleosynthetic yields) may need a substantial overhaul to be made consistent. 
0808.03112	On the decidability of semigroup freeness	Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)	Authors:Julien Cassaigne, Francois Nicolas	Abstract:  This paper deals with the decidability of semigroup freeness. More precisely, the freeness problem over a semigroup S is defined as: given a finite subset X of S, decide whether each element of S has at most one factorization over X. To date, the decidabilities of two freeness problems have been closely examined. In 1953, Sardinas and Patterson proposed a now famous algorithm for the freeness problem over the free monoid. In 1991, Klarner, Birget and Satterfield proved the undecidability of the freeness problem over three-by-three integer matrices. Both results led to the publication of many subsequent papers. The aim of the present paper is three-fold: (i) to present general results concerning freeness problems, (ii) to study the decidability of freeness problems over various particular semigroups (special attention is devoted to multiplicative matrix semigroups), and (iii) to propose precise, challenging open questions in order to promote the study of the topic. 
0808.03113	Neutron$-^{19}$C scattering near an Efimov state	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:M. T. Yamashita, T. Frederico, Lauro Tomio	Abstract:  The low-energy neutron$-^{19}$C scattering in a neutron-neutron-core model is studied with large scattering lengths near the conditions for the appearance of an Efimov state. We show that the real part of the elastic $s-$wave phase-shift ($δ_0^R$) presents a zero, or a pole in $ k\cotδ_0^{R}$, when the system has an Efimov excited or virtual state. More precisely the pole scales with the energy of the Efimov state (bound or virtual). We perform calculations in the limit of large scattering lengths, disregarding the interaction range, within a renormalized zero-range approach using subtracted equations. It is also presented a brief discussion of these findings in the context of ultracold atom physics with tunable scattering lengths. 
0808.03114	Top homology of hypergraph matching complexes, $p$-cycle complexes and Quillen complexes of symmetric groups	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:John Shareshian, Michelle L Wachs	Abstract:  We investigate the representation of a symmetric group $S_n$ on the homology of its Quillen complex at a prime $p$. For homology groups in small codimension, we derive an explicit formula for this representation in terms of the representations of symmetric groups on homology groups of $p$-uniform hypergraph matching complexes. We conjecture an explicit formula for the representation of $S_n$ on the top homology group of the corresponding hypergraph matching complex when $n \equiv 1 \bmod p$. Our conjecture follows from work of Bouc when $p=2$, and we prove the conjecture when $p=3$. 
0808.03115	Nonequilibrium isolated molecule limit	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Michael Galperin, Abraham Nitzan, Mark A. Ratner	Abstract:  Method developed by Sandalov and coworkers [Int. J. Quant. Chem. 94, 113 (2003)] is applied to inelastic transport in the case of strong correlations on the molecule, which is relatively weakly coupled to contacts. Ability of the approach to deal with the transport in the language of many-body molecular states as well as take into account charge-specific normal modes and nonadiabatic couplings is stressed. We demonstrate capabilities of the technique within simple model calculations, and compare it to previously published approaches. 
0808.03116	Single crystal growth and physical properties of the layered arsenide BaRh_2As_2	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Yogesh Singh, Y. Lee, S. Nandi, A. Kreyssig, A Ellern, S. Das, R. Nath, B. N. Harmon, A. I. Goldman, D. C. Johnston	Abstract:  Single crystals of BaRh_2As_2 have been synthesized from a Pb flux. We present the room temperature crystal structure, single crystal x-ray diffraction measurements as a function of temperature T, anisotropic magnetic susceptibility χversus T, electrical resistivity in the ab-plane ρ versus T, Hall coefficient versus T and magnetic field H, and heat capacity C versus T measurements on the crystals. The single crystal structure determination confirms that BaRh_2As_2 forms in the tetragonal ThCr_2Si_2 type structure (space group I4/mmm) with lattice parameters a = b = 4.0564(6)Åand c = 12.797(4) Å. Band structure calculations show that BaRh_2As_2 should be metallic with a small density of states at the Fermi energy N(E_ F) = 3.49 states/eV f.u. (where f.u. \equiv formula unit) for both spin directions. ρ(T) data in the ab-plane confirm that the material is indeed metallic with a residual resistivity ρ(2K) = 29 μΩcm, and with a residual resistivity ratio ρ(310K)/ρ(2K) = 5.3. The observed χ(T) is small (\sim 10^{-5} cm^3/mol) and weakly anisotropic with χ_{ab}/χ_ c \approx 2. The C(T) data indicate a small density of states at the Fermi energy with the low temperature Sommerfeld coefficient γ= 4.7(9) mJ/mol K^2. There are no indications of superconductivity, spin density wave, or structural transitions between 2K and 300K. We compare the calculated density of states versus energy of BaRh_2As_2 with that of BaFe_2As_2. 
0808.03117	The Photometric Variability of HH 30	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Alan M. Watson, María Carolina Durán-Rojas, Karl R. Stapelfeldt	Abstract:  HH 30 is an edge-on disk around a young stellar object. Previous imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope has show morphological variability that is possibly related to the rotation of the star or the disk. We report the results of two terrestrial observing campaigns to monitor the integrated magnitude of HH 30. We use the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to look for periodic modulation with periods between 2 days and almost 90 days in these two data sets and in a third, previously published, data set. We develop a method to deal with short-term correlations in the data. Our results indicate that none of the data sets shows evidence for significant periodic photometric modulation. 
0808.03118	A New Atmospheric Model for HD 189733 b	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jonathan Langton, Gregory Laughlin	Abstract:  We have developed a new two-dimensional hydrostatically-balanced isobaric hydrodynamic model for use in simulation of exoplanetary atmospheres. We apply this model to the infrared photosphere of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b, for which an excellent 8-micron light curve has been obtained. For reasonable parameter choices, the results of our model are consistent with these observations. In our simulations, strongly turbulent supersonic flow develops, with wind speeds of approximately 5 km/s. This flow geometry causes chaotic variation of the temperature distribution, leading to observable variations in the light curve from one orbit to the next. 
0808.03119	Some relative stable categories are compactly generated	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Matthew Grime, Peter Jorgensen	Abstract:  Let G be a finite group. The stable module category of G has been applied extensively in group representation theory. In particular, it has been used to great effect that it is a triangulated category which is compactly generated. Let H be a subgroup of G. It is possible to define a stable module category of G relative to H. It too is a triangulated category, but no non-trivial examples have been known where this relative stable category was compactly generated. We show here that the relative stable category is compactly generated if the group algebra of H has finite representation type. In characteristic p, this is equivalent to the Sylow p-subgroups of H being cyclic. 
0808.03120	Acoustic black hole evaporation as plasma diffusion phenomena	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Garcia de Andrade	Abstract:  Acoustic analogues of Kerr black hole in plasmas are considered, by taking for granted the existence of acoustic ion waves in plasmas. An effective black holes (BH) in curved Riemannian spacetime in a random walk plasmas is endowed with a naked singularity, when plasmas are in the lowest diffusion mode. The plasma particle diffusion is encoded in the effective metric. The diffusive solution has a horizon when the plasma flow reaches the sound velocity in the medium and a shock wave is obtained inside the slab. The sonic black hole curved Riemannian metric is also found in terms of particle number density in plasmas. The sonic BH singularity is found at the center of the plasma diffusive slab from the study of the Ricci curvature scalar for constant diffusion coefficient. It is suggested and shown that the Hawking temperature is proportional to the plasma Kelvin temperature through diffusion coefficient dependence to this temperature. Therefore Unruh sonic or dumb BH is shown to have a relation between Hawking and plasma diffusive temperatures. BH evaporation is analogous to the diffusive phenomena in plasmas, since in both cases Hawking temperature is inversely proportional to mass. It is shown that Hawking analogue temperature of a plasma torus is $T_{H}(torus)\approx{10^{-4}K}$ which is much higher than the gravitational Hawking temperature of a one solar mass BH, ${T_{H}}^{GR}\approx{10^{-8}K}$, but still very small for being detectable in plasma laboratories. 
0808.03121	Is it possible to check urgently the 5-loop analytical results for the $e^+e^-$-annihilation Adler function ?	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:A.L. Kataev	Abstract:  Considering the results of recent distinguished analytical calculations of the 5-loop single-fermion loop corrections to the QED $β$-function we emphasize that to our point of view it is important to perform their independent cross-checks. We propose one of the ways of these cross-check. It is based on the application of the original Crewther relation. We derive the new analytical expressions for the $C_F^4α_s^4$-contributions to the Bjorken polarized sum rule. If results of possible direct calculations will agree with the presented expression, then the appearance of $ζ_3$-term in the 5-loop correction to the QED $β$-function and in the $C_F^4α_s^4$ contribution into the $e^+e^-$ annihilation Adler function will get independent support and may be analysed within the framework of the recently introduced concept of "maximal transcendentality". 
0808.03122	Nonlinear harmonic generation and devices in doubly-resonant Kerr cavities	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Hila Hashemi, Alejandro W. Rodriguez, J. D. Joannopoulos, Marin Soljačić, Steven G. Johnson	Abstract:  We describea theoretical analysis of the nonlinear dynamics of third-harmonic generation ($ω\to3ω$) via Kerr ($\chithree$) nonlinearities in a resonant cavity with resonances at both $ω$ and $3ω$. Such a doubly resonant cavity greatly reduces the required power for efficient harmonic generation, by a factor of $\sim V/Q^2$ where $V$ is the modal volume and $Q$ is the lifetime, and can even exhibit 100% harmonic conversion efficiency at a critical input power. However, we show that it also exhibits a rich variety of nonlinear dynamics, such as multistable solutions and long-period limit cycles.We describe how to compensate for self/cross-phase modulation (which otherwise shifts the cavity frequencies out of resonance), and how to excite the different stable solutions (and especially the high-efficiency solutions) by specially modulated input pulses. 
0808.03123	Low-dimensional magnetism in the mixed Cr valence spin-chain compound Sr_4Cr_3O_9	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Yogesh Singh, D. C. johnston	Abstract:  Sr_4Cr_3O_9 is the n = 2 member of a family of quasi-one-dimensional compounds A_{n+2}T_{n+1}O_{3n+3} (A = Ca, Sr, or Ba, T = transition metal, and n = 1 to \infty) having a crystal structure which consists of chains of n TO_6 octahedra alternated by one TO_6 trigonal prism running along the c-axis. The chains are arranged on a triangular lattice in the ab-plane. We report the synthesis, structure, magnetization M versus magnetic field H, magnetic susceptibility χversus temperature T and specific heat C versus T measurements on sintered and arc-melted polycrystalline samples of Sr_4Cr_3O_9. The χdata have a T dependence which is typical of low-dimensional magnetic systems with dominant antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange interactions. Specifically, χ(T) shows a broad maximum at T_{max} \approx 200K for the sintered pellet and T_{max}\approx 265K for the arc-melted sample, indicating the onset of short-range magnetic order. Below T = 15K we observe 2 anomalies in the χ(T) data for both samples suggesting the onset of long-range magnetic ordering. The corresponding anomalies in the C(T) data however are weak indicating that only a small amount of the expected magnetic entropy is recovered at the magnetic transitions and that strong short-range AF order exists above these temperatures. 
0808.03124	Planck Scale Cosmology in Resummed Quantum Gravity	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:B.F.L. Ward (Department of Physics, Baylor University, Waco, TX, USA)    	Abstract:  We show that, by using resummation techniques based on the extension of the methods of Yennie, Frautschi and Suura to Feynman's formulation of Einstein's theory, we get quantum field theoretic predictions for the UV fixed-point values of the dimensionless gravitational and cosmological constants. Connections to the phenomenological asymptotic safety analysis of Planck scale cosmology by Bonanno and Reuter are discussed. 
0808.03125	Crossing the Phantom Divide with Parameterized Post-Friedmann Dark Energy	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Wenjuan Fang, Wayne Hu, Antony Lewis	Abstract:  Dark energy models with a single scalar field cannot cross the equation of state divide set by a cosmological constant. More general models that allow crossing require additional degrees of freedom to ensure gravitational stability. We show that a parameterized post-Friedmann description of cosmic acceleration provides a simple but accurate description of multiple scalar field crossing models. Moreover the prescription provides a well controlled approximation for a wide range of "smooth" dark energy models. It conserves energy and momentum and is exact in the metric evolution on scales well above and below the transition scale to relative smoothness. Standard linear perturbation tools have been altered to include this description and made publicly available for studies of the dark energy involving cosmological structure out to the horizon scale. 
0808.03126	Ricci Solitons and Einstein-Scalar Field Theory	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:M M Akbar, E Woolgar	Abstract:  B List has recently studied a geometric flow whose fixed points correspond to static Ricci flat spacetimes. It is now known that this flow is in fact Ricci flow modulo pullback by a certain diffeomorphism. We use this observation to associate to each static Ricci flat spacetime a local Ricci soliton in one higher dimension. As well, solutions of Euclidean-signature Einstein gravity coupled to a free massless scalar field with nonzero cosmological constant are associated to shrinking or expanding Ricci solitons. We exhibit examples, including an explicit family of complete expanding solitons which can be thought of as a Ricci flow for a complete Lorentzian metric. The possible generalization to Ricci-flat stationary metrics leads us to consider an alternative to Ricci flow. 
0808.03127	Making Massless Dirac Fermions from Patterned Two-Dimensional Electron Gases	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Cheol-Hwan Park, Steven G. Louie	Abstract:  Analysis of the electronic structure of an ordinary two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) under an appropriate external periodic potential of hexagonal symmetry reveals that massless Dirac fermions are generated near the corners of the supercell Brillouin zone. The required potential parameters are found to be achievable under or close to laboratory conditions. Moreover, the group velocity is tunable by changing either the effective mass of the 2DEG or the lattice parameter of the external potential, and it is insensitive to the potential amplitude. The finding should provide a new class of systems other than graphene for investigating and exploiting massless Dirac fermions using 2DEGs in semiconductors. 
0808.03128	Magnetoplasmons in layered graphene structures	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Oleg L. Berman, Godfrey Gumbs, Yurii E. Lozovik	Abstract:  We calculate the dispersion equations for magnetoplasmons in a single layer, a pair of parallel layers, a graphite bilayer and a superlattice of graphene layers in a perpendicular magnetic field. We demonstrate the feasibility of a drift-induced instability of magnetoplasmons. The magnetoplasmon instability in a superlattice is enhanced compared to a single graphene layer. The energies of the unstable magnetoplasmons could be in the terahertz (THz) part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The enhanced instability makes superlattice graphene a potential source of THz radiation. 
0808.03129	Self-organization using synaptic plasticity	Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO)	Authors:Vicenç Gómez, Andreas Kaltenbrunner, Vicente López, Hilbert J. Kappen	Abstract:  Large networks of spiking neurons show abrupt changes in their collective dynamics resembling phase transitions studied in statistical physics. An example of this phenomenon is the transition from irregular, noise-driven dynamics to regular, self-sustained behavior observed in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons as the interaction strength between the neurons increases. In this work we show how a network of spiking neurons is able to self-organize towards a critical state for which the range of possible inter-spike-intervals (dynamic range) is maximized. Self-organization occurs via synaptic dynamics that we analytically derive. The resulting plasticity rule is defined locally so that global homeostasis near the critical state is achieved by local regulation of individual synapses.

0808.03131	LHC Startup	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Wesley H. Smith	Abstract:  The Large Hadron Collider will commence operations in the latter half of 2008. The plans of the LHC experiments ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb are described. The scenario for progression of luminosity and the strategies of these 4 experiments to use the initial data are detailed. There are significant measurements possible with integrated luminosities of 1, 10 and 100 pb^-1. These measurements will provide essential calibration and tests of the detectors, understanding of the Standard Model backgrounds and a first oportunity to look for new physics. 
0808.03132	Saturated subfields and invariants of finite groups	Rings and Algebras (math.RA)	Authors:Ivan V. Arzhantsev, Anatoliy P. Petravchuk	Abstract:  Every subfield $\kk(φ)$ of the field of rational functions $\kk(x_1,...,x_n)$ is contained in a unique maximal subfield of the form $\kk(ψ)$. The element $ψ$ is called generative for the element $φ$. A subfield of $\kk(x_1,...,x_n)$ is called saturated if it contains a generative element of each its element. We study the saturation property for subfields of invariants $\kk(x_1,...,x_n)^G$, where $G$ is a finite group of automorphisms of the field $\kk(x_1,...,x_n)$. 
0808.03133	Precision QEDXQCD Resummation Theory for LHC Physics: Status and Update	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:B.F.L. Ward (1), S. Joseph (1), S. Majhi (1), S.A. Yost (2) ((1) Department of Physics, Baylor University, Waco, TX, USA, (2) Department of Physics, The Citadel, Charleston, South Carolina, USA)    	Abstract:  We present the elements of the IR-improved DGLAP-CS theory as it relates to the new MC friendly exponentiated scheme for precision calculation of higher order corrections to LHC physics in which IR singularities from both QED and QCD are canceled to all orders in alpha and in alpha_s simultaneously in the presence of rigorous shower/ME matching. We present the first MC data comparing the implied new showers themselves with the standard ones using the HERWIG6.5 MC event generator as a test case at LHC energies. As expected, the IR-improved shower re-populates lower values of the energy fraction z and lower values of the attendant p_T for the standard HERWIG6.5 input parameters. Possible phenomenological implications are discussed. 
0808.03134	QCD Calculations of Radiative B Decays	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Mikolaj Misiak	Abstract:  The current status of B -> Xs gamma decay rate calculations is summarized. Missing ingredients at the NNLO level are listed. The global normalization factor and non-perturbative effects are discussed. Arguments are presented that results for the cutoff-enhanced perturbative corrections have been misused in Ref. [15] by applying them in the region E_gamma \in [1.0, 1.6] GeV, which means that the corresponding numerical effect on BR(B -> Xs gamma, E_gamma > 1.6 GeV) is unreliable. 
0808.03135	Can a Matter-Wave Interferometer Detect Translational Speed?	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Ruyong Wang, Yi Zheng, Aiping Yao	Abstract:  Based only on the Galilean addition of velocities and the de Broglie relation, it is deduced that in a matter-wave interferometer with slow-speed particles, a moving segment of deltaL with a velocity V contributes deltaPhi = (2Pi/vlamda)VdotdeltaL to the total phase difference of the interferometer, where v is the speed of the particles and lamda is the wavelength.. This expression is exactly the same as the generalized Sagnac effect for light waves found by experiments except that v is replaced by c. For a rotational motion, it leads to the Sagnac effect. Additionally, the scientific value of this relationship is also to explore the possibility of detecting translation speeds by a matter-wave interferometer. Two configurations of the experimental setup have been indicated and the key element is that the paths of the interfering beams constitute a loop with an opening. If the possibility is confirmed by experiments, the conclusions will be that there is a preferred reference frame for matter waves and a speedometer with a very high sensitivity is possible. 
0808.03136	Asteroseismology and the Solar-Stellar Connection	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Travis S. Metcalfe (NCAR)    	Abstract:  In March 2009, NASA will launch the Kepler satellite -- a mission designed to discover habitable Earth-like planets around distant Sun-like stars. The method that Kepler will use to detect distant worlds will only reveal the size of the planet relative to the size of the host star, so part of the mission is devoted to characterizing other suns using asteroseismology. In this proceedings, I give a broad overview of the Kepler mission and the data that it will produce, with a special emphasis on how it could improve our understanding of solar and stellar dynamos. I conclude with an update on the development of a stellar modeling pipeline for interpreting asteroseismic observations. 
0808.03137	Relic density of neutrinos with primordial asymmetries	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Sergio Pastor, Teguayco Pinto, Georg Raffelt	Abstract:  We study flavor oscillations in the early universe, assuming primordial neutrino-antineutrino asymmetries. Including collisions and pair processes in the kinetic equations, we not only estimate the degree of flavor equilibration, but for the first time also kinetic equilibration among neutrinos and with the ambient plasma. Typically the restrictive BBN bound on the nue-antinue asymmetry indeed applies to all flavors as claimed in the previous literature, but fine-tuned initial asymmetries always allow for a large surviving neutrino excess radiation that may show up in precision cosmological data. 
0808.03138	Complete Treatment of Galaxy Two-Point Statistics: Gravitational Lensing Effects and Redshift-Space Distortions	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jaiyul Yoo (Harvard)    	Abstract:  We present a coherent theoretical framework for computing gravitational lensing effects and redshift-space distortions in an inhomogeneous universe and investigate their impacts on galaxy two-point statistics. Adopting the linearized FRW metric, we derive the gravitational lensing and the generalized Sachs-Wolfe effects that include the weak lensing distortion, magnification, and time delay effects, and the redshift-space distortion, Sachs-Wolfe, and integrated Sachs-Wolfe effects, respectively. Based on this framework, we first compute their effects on observed source fluctuations, separating them as two physically distinct origins: the volume effect that involves the change of volume and is always present in galaxy two-point statistics, and the source effect that depends on the intrinsic properties of source populations. Then we identify several terms that are ignored in the standard method, and we compute the observed galaxy two-point statistics, an ensemble average of all the combinations of the intrinsic source fluctuations and the additional contributions from the gravitational lensing and the generalized Sachs-Wolfe effects. This unified treatment of galaxy two-point statistics clarifies the relation of the gravitational lensing and the generalized Sachs-Wolfe effects to the metric perturbations and the underlying matter fluctuations. For near future dark energy surveys, we compute additional contributions to the observed galaxy two-point statistics and analyze their impact on the anisotropic structure. Thorough theoretical modeling of galaxy two-point statistics would be not only necessary to analyze precision measurements from upcoming dark energy surveys, but also provide further discriminatory power in understanding the underlying physical mechanisms. 
0808.03139	The star-formation history of K-selected galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:L. Dunne, R.J. Ivison, S. Maddox, M. Cirasuolo, A.M. Mortier, S. Foucaud, E. Ibar, O. Almaini, C. Simpson, R. McLure	Abstract:  We have studied the uJy radio properties of K-selected galaxies detected in the Ultra-Deep Survey portion of UKIDSS using 610- and 1,400-MHz images from the VLA and GMRT. These deep radio mosaics, combined with the largest and deepest K image currently available, allow high-S/N detections of many K-selected sub-populations, including sBzK and pBzK star-forming and passive galaxies. We find a strong correlation between the radio and K fluxes and a linear relationship between SFR and K luminosity. We find no evidence, from either radio spectral indices or a comparison with submm-derived SFRs, that the full sample is strongly contaminated by AGN. The sBzK and pBzK galaxies have similar levels of radio flux, SFR and specific SFR (SSFR) at z < 1.4, suggesting there is strong contamination of the pBzK sample by star-forming galaxies. At z > 1.4, pBzK galaxies become difficult to detect in the radio stack, though the implied SFRs are still much higher than expected for passively evolving galaxies. Their radio emission may come from low-luminosity AGN. EROs straddle the passive and star-forming regions of the BzK diagram and also straddle the two groups in terms of their radio properties. K-bright ERO samples are dominated by passive galaxies and faint ERO samples contain more star-forming galaxies. The star-formation history (SFH) from stacking all K sources in the UDS agrees well with that derived for other wavebands and other radio surveys, at least out to z ~ 2. The radio-derived SFH then appears to fall more steeply than that measured at other wavelengths. The SSFR for K-selected sources rises strongly with redshift at all stellar masses, and shows a weak dependence on stellar mass. High- and low-mass galaxies show a similar decline in SSFR since z ~ 2 (abridged). 
0808.03140	Direct calculation of the radiative efficiency of an accretion disk around a black hole	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Scott C. Noble (1), Julian H. Krolik (1), John F. Hawley (2) ((1) Department of Physics and Astronomy, Johns Hopkins University; (2) Astronomy Department, University of Virginia)    	Abstract:  Numerical simulation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence makes it possible to study accretion dynamics in detail. However, special effort is required to connect inflow dynamics (dependent largely on angular momentum transport) to radiation (dependent largely on thermodynamics and photon diffusion). To this end we extend the flux-conservative, general relativistic MHD code HARM from axisymmetry to full 3D. The use of an energy conserving algorithm allows the energy dissipated in the course of relativistic accretion to be captured as heat. The inclusion of a simple optically thin cooling function permits explicit control of the simulated disk's geometric thickness as well as a direct calculation of both the amplitude and location of the radiative cooling associated with the accretion stresses. Fully relativistic ray-tracing is used to compute the luminosity received by distant observers. For a disk with aspect ratio H/r ~ 0.1 accreting onto a black hole with spin parameter a/M = 0.9, we find that there is significant dissipation beyond that predicted by the classical Novikov-Thorne model. However, much of it occurs deep in the potential, where photon capture and gravitational redshifting can strongly limit the net photon energy escaping to infinity. In addition, with these parameters and this radiation model, significant thermal and magnetic energy remains with the gas and is accreted by the black hole. In our model, the net luminosi ty reaching infinity is 6% greater than the Novikov-Thorne prediction. If the accreted thermal energy were wholly radiated, the total luminosity of the accretion flow would be ~20% greater than the Novikov-Thorne value. 
0808.03141	Suzaku Observations of Four Heavily Absorbed HMXBs	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:D.C. Morris, R.K. Smith, C.B. Markwardt, R.F. Mushotzky, J. Tueller, T.R. Kallman, K.S. Dhuga	Abstract:  We report on Suzaku observations of four unidentified sources from the INTEGRAL and Swift BAT Galactic plane surveys. All the sources have a large neutral hydrogen column density and are likely members of an emerging class of heavily absorbed high mass X-ray binary (HMXB) first identified in INTEGRAL observations. Two of the sources in our sample are approximately constant flux sources, one source shows periodic variation and one source exhibited a short, bright X-ray outburst. The periodicity is transient, suggesting it is produced by a neutron star in an elliptical orbit around a stellar wind source. We analyze the flaring source in several segments to look for spectral variation and discuss the implications of the findings for the nature of the source. We conclude that all four sources in our sample can be identified with the emerging class of highly absorbed HMXBs, that one is a newly identified transient X-ray pulsar and that at least one is a newly identified supergiant fast X-ray transient (SFXT). 
0808.03142	Weak quasistatic magnetism in the frustrated Kondo lattice Pr_2Ir_2O_7	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:D. E. MacLaughlin, Y. Ohta, Y. Machida, S. Nakatsuji, G. M. Luke, K. Ishida, R. H. Heffner, Lei Shu, O. O. Bernal	Abstract:  Muon spin relaxation experiments have been performed in the pyrochlore iridate Pr_2Ir_2O_7 for temperatures in the range 0.025-250 K. Kubo-Toyabe relaxation functions are observed up to > 200 K, indicating static magnetism over this temperature range. The T -> 0 static muon spin relaxation rate Delta(0) ~ 8 mus^-1 implies a weak quasistatic moment (~0.1 mu_B). The temperature dependence of Delta is highly non-mean-field-like, decreasing smoothly by orders of magnitude but remaining nonzero below ~150 K. The data rule out ordering of the full Pr^3+ CEF ground-state moment (3.0 mu_B) down to 0.025 K. The weak static magnetism is most likely due to hyperfine-enhanced ^141Pr nuclear magnetism. The dynamic relaxation rate lambda increases markedly below ~20 K, probably due to slowing down of spin fluctuations in the spin-liquid state. At low temperatures lambda is strong and temperature-independent, indicative of a high density of low-lying spin excitations as is common in frustrated antiferromagnets. 
0808.03143	Multiple solutions for the $p-$laplace operator with critical growth	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Pablo L. De Nápoli, Julián Fernández Bonder, Analía Silva	Abstract:  In this note we show the existence of at least three nontrivial solutions to the following quasilinear elliptic equation $-Δ_p u = |u|^{p^*-2}u + λf(x,u)$ in a smooth bounded domain $Ω$ of $\R^N$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\partialΩ$, where $p^*=Np/(N-p)$ is the critical Sobolev exponent and $Δ_p u =div(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u)$ is the $p-$laplacian. The proof is based on variational arguments and the classical concentrated compactness method. 
0808.03144	SuperIso v3.0: A program for calculating flavor physics observables in 2HDM and supersymmetry	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:F. Mahmoudi	Abstract:  We describe SuperIso v3.0 which is a public program for evaluation of flavor physics observables in the Standard Model (SM), general two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM), minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and next to minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). SuperIso v3.0, in addition to the branching ratio of B -> X_s gamma and the isospin asymmetry of B -> K* gamma, incorporates other flavor observables such as the branching ratio of B_s -> mu+ mu-, the branching ratio of B -> tau nu_tau, the branching ratio of B -> D tau nu_tau, the branching ratio of K -> mu nu_mu and the branching ratios of D_s -> tau nu_tau and D_s -> mu nu_mu. The calculation of the branching ratio of B -> X_s gamma is also improved, as it includes NNLO Standard Model contributions. The program also computes the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g-2). Nine sample models are included in the package, namely SM, 2HDM, and mSUGRA, NUHM, AMSB and GMSB for the MSSM, and CNMSSM, NGMSB and NNUHM for the NMSSM. SuperIso uses a SUSY Les Houches Accord file (SLHA1 or SLHA2) as input, which can be either generated automatically by the program via a call to external spectrum calculators, or provided by the user. The calculation of the observables is detailed in the Appendices, where a suggestion for the allowed intervals for each observable is also provided. 
0808.03145	Approximate capacity of the two-way relay channel: A deterministic approach	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Amir Salman Avestimehr, Aydin Sezgin, David N.C. Tse	Abstract:  We study the capacity of the full-duplex bidirectional (or two-way) relay channel with two nodes and one relay. The channels in the forward direction are assumed to be different (in general) than the channels in the backward direction, i.e. channel reciprocity is not assumed. We use the recently proposed deterministic approach to capture the essence of the problem and to determine a good transmission and relay strategy for the Gaussian channel. Depending on the ratio of the individual channel gains, we propose to use either a simple amplify-and-forward or a particular superposition coding strategy at the relay. We analyze the achievable rate region and show that the scheme achieves to within 3 bits the cut-set bound for all values of channel gains. 
0808.03146	Thermal-radiation-induced nonequilibrium carriers in an intrinsic graphene	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:P.N. Romanets, F.T. Vasko, M.V. Strikha	Abstract:  We examine an intrinsic graphene connected to the phonon thermostat at temperature T under irradiation of thermal photons with temperature T_r, other than T. The distribution of nonequilibrium electron-hole pairs was obtained for the cases of low and high concentration of carriers. For the case when the interparticle scattering is unessential, the distribution function is determined by the interplay of intraband relaxation of energy due to acoustic phonons and interband radiative transitions caused by the thermal radiation. When the Coulomb scattering dominates, then the quasi-equilibrium distribution with effective temperature and non-equilibrium concentration, determined through balance equations, is realized. Due to the effect of thermal radiation with temperature $T_r\neq T$ concentration and conductivity of carriers in graphene modify essentially. It is demonstrated, that at $T_r>T$ the negative interband absorption, caused by the inversion of carriers distribution, can occur, i.e. graphene can be unstable under thermal irradiation. 
0808.03147	On slim double Lie groupoids	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Nicolas Andruskiewitsch, Jesus Alonso Ochoa Arango, Alejandro Tiraboschi	Abstract:  We prove that every slim double Lie groupoid with proper core action is completely determined by a factorization of a certain canonically defined "diagonal" Lie groupoid. 
0808.03148	Photo-induced separation of chiral isomers in a classical buffer gas	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:B. Spivak, A. V. Andreev	Abstract:  We develop a theory of photo-induced drift of chiral molecules or small particles in classical buffer gases. In the absence of a magnetic field there exists a flux of chiral molecules, provided the electromagnetic field is circularly polarized. It has opposite signs for different chiral isomers. In the presence of a magnetic field the flux can be also induced by a linearly polarized (or unpolarized) electromagnetic field. The magnitude of the flux is not proportional to either linear or orbital momentum of the electromagnetic field. 
0808.03149	The Time Inversion for Modified Oscillators	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Ricardo Cordero-Soto, Sergei K. Suslov	Abstract:  We discuss a new completely integrable case of the time-dependent Schroedinger equation in $R^n$ with variable coefficients for a modified oscillator, which is dual with respect to the time inversion to a model of the quantum oscillator recently considered by Meiler, Cordero-Soto, and Suslov. A second pair of dual Hamiltonians is also found in the momentum representation. Our examples show that in mathematical physics and quantum mechanics a change in the direction of time may require a total change of the system dynamics in order to return the system back to its original quantum state. Particular solutions of the corresponding Schroedinger equations are also obtained. A Hamiltonian structure of the classical integrable problem and its quantization are also discussed. 
0808.03150	Strong mass segregation around a massive black hole	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Tal Alexander (Weizmann Inst.), Clovis Hopman (Leiden Obs.)    	Abstract:  We show that the mass-segregation solution for the steady state distribution of stars around a massive black hole (MBH) has two branches: the known weak segregation solution (Bahcall & Wolf 1977), and a newly discovered strong segregation solution, presented here. The nature of the solution depends on the heavy-to-light stellar mass ratio M_H/M_L and on the unbound population number ratio N_H/N_L, through the relaxational coupling parameter Δ=4 N_H M_H^2 /[N_L M_L^2(3+M_H/M_L)]. When the heavy stars are relatively common (Δ>>1), they scatter frequently on each other. This efficient self-coupling leads to weak mass segregation, where the stars form n \propto r^{-α_M} mass-dependent cusps near the MBH, with indices α_H=7/4 for the heavy stars and 3/2<α_L<7/4 for the light stars (i.e. \max(α_H-α_L)~=1/4). However, when the heavy stars are relatively rare (Δ<<1), they scatter mostly on light stars, sink to the center by dynamical friction and settle into a much steeper cusp with 2~<α_H<11/4, while the light stars form a 3/2<α_L<7/4 cusp, resulting in strong segregation (i.e. \max(α_H-α_L)~=1). We show that the present-day mass function of evolved stellar populations (coeval or continuously star forming) with a universal initial mass function, separate into two distinct mass scales, ~1 Mo of main sequence and compact dwarfs, and ~10 Mo of stellar black holes (SBHs), and have Δ<0.1. We conclude that it is likely that many relaxed galactic nuclei are strongly segregated. We review indications of strong segregation in observations of the Galactic Center and in results of numeric simulations, and briefly list some possible implications of a very high central concentration of SBHs around a MBH. 
0808.03151	Glueball matrix elements: a lattice calculation and applications	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Harvey B. Meyer	Abstract:  We compute the matrix elements of the energy-momentum tensor between glueball states and the vacuum in SU(3) lattice gauge theory and extrapolate them to the continuum. These matrix elements may play an important phenomenological role in identifying glue-rich mesons. Based on a relation derived long ago by the ITEP group for J/psi radiative decays, the scalar matrix element leads to a branching ratio for the glueball that is at least three times larger than the experimentally observed branching ratio for the f_0 mesons above 1GeV. This suggests that the glueball component must be diluted quite strongly among the known scalar mesons. Finally we review the current best continuum determination of the scalar and tensor glueball masses, the deconfining temperature, the string tension and the Lambda parameter, all in units of the Sommer reference scale, using calculations based on the Wilson action.

Cardona, R. K. Kremer, R. Lauck, G. Siegle, J. Serrano, X. C. Gonze	Abstract:  During the past five years the low temperature heat capacity of simple semiconductors and insulators has received renewed attention. Of particular interest has been its dependence on isotopic masses and the effect of spin- orbit coupling in ab initio calculations. Here we concentrate on the lead chalcogenides PbS, PbSe and PbTe. These materials, with rock salt structure, have different natural isotopes for both cations and anions, a fact that allows a systematic experimental and theoretical study of isotopic effects e.g. on the specific heat. Also, the large spin-orbit splitting of the 6p electrons of Pb and the 5p of Te allows, using a computer code which includes spin-orbit interaction, an investigation of the effect of this interaction on the phonon dispersion relations and the temperature dependence of the specific heat and on the lattice parameter. It is shown that agreement between measurements and calculations significantly improves when spin-orbit interaction is included. 
0808.03153	A Sample of Very Young Field L Dwarfs and Implications for the Brown Dwarf "Lithium Test" at Early Ages	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. Davy Kirkpatrick, Kelle L. Cruz, Travis S. Barman, Adam J. Burgasser, Dagny L. Looper, C. G. Tinney, Christopher R. Gelino, Patrick J. Lowrance, James Liebert, John M. Carpenter, Lynne A. Hillenbrand, John R. Stauffer	Abstract:  Using a large sample of optical spectra of late-type dwarfs, we identify a subset of late-M through L field dwarfs that, because of the presence of low-gravity features in their spectra, are believed to be unusually young. From a combined sample of 303 field L dwarfs, we find observationally that 7.6+/-1.6% are younger than 100 Myr. This percentage is in agreement with theoretical predictions once observing biases are taken into account. We find that these young L dwarfs tend to fall in the southern hemisphere (Dec < 0 deg) and may be previously unrecognized, low-mass members of nearby, young associations like Tucana-Horologium, TW Hydrae, beta Pictoris, and AB Doradus. We use a homogeneously observed sample of roughly one hundred and fifty 6300-10000 Angstrom spectra of L and T dwarfs taken with the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer at the W. M. Keck Observatory to examine the strength of the 6708-A Li I line as a function of spectral type and further corroborate the trends noted by Kirkpatrick et al. (2000). We use our low-gravity spectra to investigate the strength of the Li I line as a function of age. The data weakly suggest that for early- to mid-L dwarfs the line strength reaches a maximum for a few 100 Myr, whereas for much older (few Gyr) and much younger (<100 Myr) L dwarfs the line is weaker or undetectable. We show that a weakening of lithium at lower gravities is predicted by model atmosphere calculations, an effect partially corroborated by existing observational data. Larger samples containing L dwarfs of well determined ages are needed to further test this empirically. If verified, this result would reinforce the caveat first cited in Kirkpatrick et al. (2006) that the lithium test should be used with caution when attempting to confirm the substellar nature of the youngest brown dwarfs. 
0808.03154	On the accuracy of DFT exchange-correlation functionals for H bonds in small water clusters II: The water hexamer and van der Waals interactions	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Biswajit Santra, Angelos Michaelides, Martin Fuchs, Alexandre Tkatchenko, Claudia Filippi, Matthias Scheffler	Abstract:  Second order Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) at the complete basis set (CBS) limit and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) are used to examine several low energy isomers of the water hexamer. Both approaches predict the so-called "prism" to be the lowest energy isomer, followed by "cage", "book", and "cyclic" isomers. The energies of the four isomers are very similar, all being within 10-15 meV/H2O. This reference data is then used to evaluate the performance of several density-functional theory (DFT) exchange-correlation (xc) functionals. A subset of the xc functionals tested for smaller water clusters [I: Santra et al., J. Chem. Phys. 127, 184104 (2007)] has been considered. Whilst certain functionals do a reasonable job at predicting the absolute dissociation energies of the various isomers (coming within 10-20 meV/H2O), none predict the correct energetic ordering of the four isomers, nor does any predict the correct low total energy isomer. All xc functionals tested either predict the book or cyclic isomers to have the largest dissociation energies. A many-body decomposition of the total interaction energies within the hexamers leads to the conclusion that the failure lies in the poor description of van der Waals (dispersion) forces in the xc functionals considered. It is shown that the addition of an empirical pairwise (attractive) C6/R6 correction to certain functionals allows for an improved energetic ordering of the hexamers. The relevance of these results to density-functional simulations of liquid water is also briefly discussed.

0808.03156	Perturbation of Nuclear Decay Rates During the Solar Flare of 13 December 2006	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jere H. Jenkins, Ephraim Fischbach	Abstract:  Recently, Jenkins, et al. have reported the detection of correlations between fluctuations in nuclear decay rates and Earth-Sun distance, which suggest that nuclear decay rates can be affected by solar activity. In this paper, we report the detection of a significant decrease in the decay of 54Mn during the solar flare of 13 December 2006, whose x-rays were first recorded at 02:37 UT (21:37 EST on 12 December). Our detector was a 1 uCi sample of 54Mn, whose decay rate exhibited a dip coincident in time with spikes in both the x-ray and proton fluxes recorded by the GOES-10 and 11 satellites. A secondary peak in the x-ray and proton fluxes on 17 December at 12:40 EST was also accompanied by a coincident dip in the 54Mn decay rate. These observations support the claim by Jenkins, et al. that nuclear decay rates vary with Earth-Sun distance. 
0808.03157	Probing Supergravity Unified Theories at the Large Hadron Collider	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Zuowei Liu	Abstract:  The discovery of supersymmetry is one of the major goals of the current experiments at the Tevatron and in proposed experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However when sparticles are produced the signatures of their production will to a significant degree depend on their hierarchical mass patterns. Here we investigate hierarchical mass patterns for the four lightest sparticles within one of the leading candidate theories - the SUGRA model. Specifically we analyze the hierarchies for the four lightest sparticles for the mSUGRA as well as for a general class of supergravity unified models including nonuniversalities in the soft breaking sector. It is shown that out of nearly $10^4$ possibilities of sparticle mass hierarchies, only a small number survives the rigorous constraints of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking, relic density and other experimental constraints. The signature space of these mass patterns at the LHC is investigated using a large set of final states including multi-leptonic states, hadronically decaying $τ$s, tagged $b$ jets and other hadronic jets. In all, we analyze more than 40 such lepton plus jet and missing energy signatures along with several kinematical signatures such as missing transverse momentum, effective mass, and invariant mass distributions of final state observables. It is shown that a composite analysis can produce significant discrimination among sparticle mass patterns allowing for a possible identification of the source of soft breaking. While the analysis given is for supergravity models, the techniques used in the analysis are applicable to wide class of models including string and brane models. 
0808.03158	Towards a microscopic description of dimer adsorbates on metallic surfaces	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Jaime Merino, Laszlo Borda, Pascal Simon	Abstract:  Despite the experimental successes of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and the interest in more complex magnetic nanostructures, our present understanding and theoretical description of STM spectra of magnetic adatoms is mainly phenomenological and most often ignores many-body effects. Here, we propose a theory which includes a microscopic description of the wave functions of the substrate and magnetic adatoms together with quantum many-body effects. To test our theory, we have computed the STM spectra of magnetic Cobalt monomers and dimers adsorbed on metallic Copper surfaces and succesfully compared our results to recent available experimental data. 
0808.03159	Spin-isospin resonances: A self-consistent covariant description	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Haozhao Liang, Nguyen Van Giai, Jie Meng	Abstract:  For the first time a fully self-consistent charge-exchange relativistic RPA based on the relativistic Hartree-Fock (RHF) approach is established. The self-consistency is verified by the so-called isobaric analog state (IAS) check. The excitation properties and the non-energy weighted sum rules of two important charge-exchange excitation modes, the Gamow-Teller resonance (GTR) and the spin-dipole resonance (SDR), are well reproduced in the doubly magic nuclei $^{48}$Ca, $^{90}$Zr and $^{208}$Pb without readjustment of the particle-hole residual interaction. The dominant contribution of the exchange diagrams is demonstrated. 
0808.03160	Critical heat flux around strongly-heated nanoparticles	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Samy Merabia (LPMCN), Pawel Keblinski, Laurent Joly (LPMCN), Laurent Lewis, Jean-Louis Barrat (LPMCN)    	Abstract:  We study heat transfer from a heated nanoparticle into surrounding fluid, using molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the fluid next to the nanoparticle can be heated well above its boiling point without a phase change. Under increasing nanoparticle temperature, the heat flux saturates which is in sharp contrast with the case of flat interfaces, where a critical heat flux is observed followed by development of a vapor layer and heat flux drop. These differences in heat transfer are explained by the curvature induced pressure close to the nanoparticle, which inhibits boiling. When the nanoparticle temperature is much larger than the critical fluid temperature, a very large temperature gradient develops resulting in close to ambient temperature just radius away from the particle surface 
0808.03161	The W40 Cloud Complex	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Steven A. Rodney, Bo Reipurth	Abstract:  The W40 complex is a nearby site of recent massive star formation composed of a dense molecular cloud adjacent to an HII region that contains an embedded OB star cluster. The HII region is beginning to blister out and break free from its envelope of molecular gas, but our line of sight to the central stars is largely obscured by intervening dust. Several bright OB stars in W40 - visible at optical, infrared, or cm wavelengths - are providing the ionizing flux that heats the HII region. The known stellar component of W40 is dominated by a small number of partly or fully embedded OB stars which have been studied at various wavelengths, but the lower mass stellar population remains largely unexamined. Despite its modest optical appearance, at 600pc W40 is one of the nearest massive star forming regions, and with a UV flux of about 1/10th of the Orion Nebula Cluster, this neglected region deserves detailed investigation. 
0808.03162	Noise-based logic: Binary, multi-valued, or fuzzy, with optional superposition of logic states	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:Laszlo B. Kish	Abstract:  A new type of deterministic (non-probabilistic) computer logic system inspired by the stochasticity of brain signals is shown. The distinct values are represented by independent stochastic processes: independent voltage (or current) noises. The orthogonality of these processes provides a natural way to construct binary or multi-valued logic circuitry with arbitrary number N of logic values by using analog circuitry. Moreover, the logic values on a single wire can be made a (weighted) superposition of the N distinct logic values. Fuzzy logic is also naturally represented by a two-component superposition within the binary case (N=2). Error propagation and accumulation are suppressed. Other relevant advantages are reduced energy dissipation and leakage current problems, and robustness against circuit noise and background noises such as 1/f, Johnson, shot and crosstalk noise. Variability problems are also nonexistent because the logic value is an AC signal. A similar logic system can be built with orthogonal sinusoidal signals (different frequency or orthogonal phase) however that has an extra 1/N type slowdown compared to the noise-based logic system with increasing number of N furthermore it is less robust against time delay effects than the noise-based counterpart. 
0808.03163	Bepcii and Besiii	Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)	Authors:Frederick A. Harris (For the BES Collaboration)    	Abstract:  The Beijing Electron Collider has been upgraded (BEPCII) to a two-ring collider with a design luminosity of $1 \times 10^{33}$cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at a center-of-mass energy of 3.78 GeV. It will operate between 2 and 4.6 GeV in the center of mass. With this luminosity, the BESIII detector will be able to collect, for example, 10 billion $J/ψ$ events in one year of running. This will be a unique facility in the world opening many physics opportunities. BEPCII and BESIII are both currently being commissioned, first events have been obtained, and data taking will take place in fall 2008. 
0808.03164	Searching for Narrow Emission Lines in X-ray Spectra: Computation and Methods	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Taeyoung Park, David A. van Dyk, Aneta Siemiginowska	Abstract:  The detection and quantification of narrow emission lines in X-ray spectra is a challenging statistical task. The Poisson nature of the photon counts leads to local random fluctuations in the observed spectrum that often results in excess emission in a narrow band of energy resembling a weak narrow line. From a formal statistical perspective, this leads to a (sometimes highly) multimodal likelihood. Many standard statistical procedures are based on (asymptotic) Gaussian approximations to the likelihood and simply cannot be used in such settings. Bayesian methods offer a more direct paradigm for accounting for such complicated likelihood functions but even here multimodal likelihoods pose significant computational challenges. The new Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods developed in 2008 by van Dyk and Park, however, are able to fully explore the complex posterior distribution of the location of a narrow line, and thus provide valid statistical inference. Even with these computational tools, standard statistical quantities such as means and standard deviations cannot adequately summarize inference and standard testing procedures cannot be used to test for emission lines. In this paper, we use new efficient MCMC algorithms to fit the location of narrow emission lines, we develop new statistical strategies for summarizing highly multimodal distributions and quantifying valid statistical inference, and we extend the method of posterior predictive p-values proposed by Protassov et al. (2002) to test for the presence of narrow emission lines in X-ray spectra. We illustrate and validate our methods using simulation studies and apply them to the Chandra observations of the high redshift quasar PG1634+706. 
0808.03165	Effects of interaction of electron donor and accepter molecules on the electronic structure of graphene	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Rakesh Voggu, Barun Das, Chandra Sekhar Rout, C. N. R. Rao	Abstract:  Effects of interaction of graphene with electron donor and acceptor molecules have been investigated by employing Raman spectroscopy. The G band softens progressively with the increasing concentration of tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) which is an electron donor while the band stiffens with increasing concentration of tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) which is an electron-acceptor molecule. Both TTF and TCNE broaden the G-band. The 2D band position is also affected by interaction with TTF and TCNE. The intensity of the 2D-band decreases markedly with the concentration of either. The ratio of intensities of the 2D and G bands decreases with increase in TTF and TCNE concentrations. The electrical resistivity of graphene varies in opposite directions on interaction with TTF and TCNE. All these effects occur due to molecular charge-transfer, as evidenced by the observation of charge-transfer bands in the electronic absorption spectra. 
0808.03166	Privacy Preserving Association Rule Mining Revisited	Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)	Authors:Abedelaziz Mohaisen, Dowon Hong	Abstract:  The privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) has been one of the most interesting, yet challenging, research issues. In the PPDM, we seek to outsource our data for data mining tasks to a third party while maintaining its privacy. In this paper, we revise one of the recent PPDM schemes (i.e., FS) which is designed for privacy preserving association rule mining (PP-ARM). Our analysis shows some limitations of the FS scheme in term of its storage requirements guaranteeing a reasonable privacy standard and the high computation as well. On the other hand, we introduce a robust definition of privacy that considers the average case privacy and motivates the study of a weakness in the structure of FS (i.e., fake transactions filtering). In order to overcome this limit, we introduce a hybrid scheme that considers both privacy and resources guidelines. Experimental results show the efficiency of our proposed scheme over the previously introduced one and opens directions for further development. 
0808.03167	Low energy theory of the t-t'-t''-U Hubbard Model at half-filling: interaction strengths in cuprate superconductors and an effective spin-only description of La_2CuO_4	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:J.-Y. P. Delannoy (Phys-ENS), M. J. P. Gingras, P. C. W. Holdsworth (Phys-ENS), A.-M. S. Tremblay	Abstract:  Spin-only descriptions of the half-filled one-band Hubbard model are relevant for a wide range of Mott insulators. In addition to the usual Heisenberg exchange, many new types of interactions, including ring exchange, appear in the effective Hamiltonian in the intermediate coupling regime. In order to improve on the quantitative description of magnetic excitations in the insulating antiferromagnetic phase of copper-oxide (cuprate) materials, and to be consistent with band structure calculations and photoemission experiments on these systems, we include second and third neighbor hopping parameters, t' and t'', into the Hubbard Hamiltonian. A unitary transformation method is used to find systematically the effective Hamiltonian and any operator in the spin-only representation. The results include all closed, four hop electronic pathways in the canonical transformation. The method generates many ring exchange terms that play an important role in the comparison with experiments on La2CuO4. Performing a spin wave analysis, we calculate the magnon dispersion as a function of U,t,t' and t''. The four parameters are estimated by fitting the magnon dispersion to the experimental results of Coldea et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 5377, {2001}] for La2CuO4. The ring exchange terms are found essential, in particular to determine the relative sign of t' and t'', with the values found in good agreement with independent theoretical and experimental estimates for other members of the cuprate family. The zero temperature sublattice magnetization is calculated using these parameters and also found to be in good agreement with the experimental value estimated by Lee et al. [Phys. Rev. B 60, 3643 (1999)]. We find a value of the interaction strength U~8t consistent with Mott insulating behavior. 
0808.03168	Width of exotics from QCD sum rules : tetraquarks or molecules?	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Su Houng Lee, Kenji Morita, Marina Nielsen	Abstract:  We investigate the widths of the recently observed charmonium like resonances X(3872), Z(4430) and Z_2(4250) using QCD sum rules. Extending previous analyses regarding these states as diquark-antiquark states or molecules of D mesons, we introduce the Breit-Wigner function in the pole term. We find that introducing the width increases the mass at small Borel window region. Using the OPE up to dimension eight, we find that the sum rules based on interpolating current with molecular components give a stable Borel curve from which both the masses and widths of these resonances can be well obtained. Thus the QCD sum rule approach strongly favors the molecular description of these states. 
0808.03169	Algebraic characterization of the isometries of the hyperbolic 5-space	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Krishnendu Gongopadhyay	Abstract:  Using the representation of the isometries as 2x2 invertible matrices over the division algebra $\H$ of quaternions, we give an algebraic characterization of the dynamical types of the orientation-preserving isometries of the hyperbolic 5-space. We also determine the conjugacy classes and the conjugacy classes of centralizers or the z-classes in $GL(2, \H)$. 
0808.03170	Extensivity of Irreversible Current and Stability in Causal Dissipative Hydrodynamics	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:G. S. Denicol, T. Kodama, T. Koide, Ph. Mota	Abstract:  We extended our formulation of causal dissipative hydrodynamics [T. Koide \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. \textbf{C75}, 034909 (2007)] to be applicable to the ultra-relativistic regime by considering the extensiveness of irreversible currents. The new equation has a non-linear term which suppresses the effect of viscosity. We found that such a term is necessary to guarantee the positive definiteness of the inertia term and stabilize numerical calculations in ultra-relativistic initial conditions. Because of the suppression of the viscosity, the behavior of the fluid is more close to that of the ideal fluid. Our result is essentially same as that from the extended irreversible thermodynamics, but is different from the Israel-Stewart theory. A possible origin of the difference is discussed. 
0808.03171	Energy loss of charged particles in a two-dimensional Dirac plasma	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Aqsa Arshad, Kashif Sabeeh, M. Tahir	Abstract:  The stopping power and energy loss rate of charged particles traversing a two-dimensional Dirac plasma is investigated. The Dirac plasma considered here models a solid state system, recently realized graphene monolayer, where the conduction electrons obey the Dirac-like equation and exhibit a linear in momentum dispersion relation. Theoretical work presented here is based on the the dielectric response function and the dynamical structure function within the Random-Phase-Approximation (RPA). 
0808.03172	Reconstruction of the unitary symmetry in super-relativity	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:Peter Leifer	Abstract:  The reconstruction of the unitary symmetry \cite{TFD} under non-linear dynamical mapping Hilbert space of action amplitudes $C^N$ onto projective Hilbert space $CP(N-1)$ \cite{Le1} has been applied here to the quantum dynamics of elementary vacuum excitations. The "vacuum manifold of virtual action states" is represented here by $CP(N-1)$ whereas its tangent vectors define local dynamical variables (LDV's) describing "matter". The conservation laws of LDV's express self-conservation of the "material particles" during continuous evolution being expressed as the affine parallel transport agrees with Fubuni-Study metric, create the "affine gauge potential" as the solution of the partial differential equations. Such procedure embeds the quantum dynamics into dynamical space-time whose state-dependent coordinates arose due to encoding results of quantum measurement by the qubit spinor whose components subjected to Lorentz transformations of "quantum boosts" and "quantum rotations". Thereby, in the framework of super-relativity, the objective character of the quantum measurement is inherently related to the dynamical space-time structure that replaces the notion of "observer". 
0808.03173	Probability distribution of (Schwämmle and Tsallis) two-parameter entropies and the Lambert W-function	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Somayeh Asgarani, Behrouz Mirza	Abstract:  We investigate a two-parameter entropy introduced by Schwämmle and Tsallis and obtain its probability distribution in the canonical ensemble. The probability distribution is given in terms of the Lambert W-function which has been used in many branches of physics, especially in fractal structures. Also, extensivity of $S_{q,q'}$ is discussed and a relationship is found to exist between the probabilities of a composite system and its subsystems so that the two-parameter entropy, $S_{q,q'}$, is extensive. 
0808.03174	Infrared regularization with vector mesons and baryons	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:P.C. Bruns, Ulf-G.

0808.03175	Conformal intercept of BFKL pomeron with NLO running coupling constant corrections	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Sergey Bondarenko	Abstract:  In the present note we propose a shift of the anomalous dimension function of the eigenfunctions of the BFKL equation with the NLO running coupling corrections. The calculated eigenvalue of the modified equation turns out to be conformal invariant and we discuss consequences of this result. 
0808.03176	On the EPR-type Entanglement in the Experiments of Scully et Al. I. The Micromaser Case and Delayed-choice Quantum Erasure	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Fedor Herbut	Abstract:  Delayed-choice erasure is investigated in two-photon two-slit experiments that are generalizations of the micromaser experiment of Scully et al. [Scully, M. O. et al. Nature 351, 111-116 (1991)]. Applying quantum mechanics to the localization detector, it is shown that erasure with delayed choice in the sense of Scully, has an analogous structure as simple erasure. The description goes beyond probabilities. The EPR-type disentanglement, consisting in two mutually incompatible distant measurements, is used as a general framework in both parts of this study. Two simple coherence cases are shown to emerge naturally, and they are precisely the two experiments of Scully et al. The treatment seems to require the relative-reality-of-unitarily-evolving-state (RRUES) approach. Besides insight in the exoeriments, this study has also the goal of insight in quantum mechanics. The question is if it can be more than just a "book-keeping device" for calculating probabilities as Scully et al. modestly and cautiously claim. 
0808.03177	On EPR-type Entanglement in the Experiments of Scully et Al. II. Insight in the Real Random Delayed-choice Erasure Experiment	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Fedor Herbut	Abstract:  It was pointed out in the first part of this study that EPR-type entanglement is defined by the possibility of performing any of two mutually incompatible distant, i. e.,direct-interaction-free, measurements. They go together under the term 'EPR-type disentanglement'. In this second part, quantum-mechanical insight is gained in the real random delayed-choice erasure experiment of Kim et al. [Kim et al.: Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 1-5 (2000)] by a relative-reality-of- unitarily-evolving-state (RRUES) approach (explained in the first part). Finally, it is shown that this remarkable experiment, which performs, by random choice, two incompatible measurements at the same time, is actually an EPR-type disentanglement experiment, closely related to the micromaser experiment discussed in the first part. 
0808.03178	Exact decoherence dynamics of a single-mode optical field	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Jun-Hong An, Ye Yeo, C. H. Oh	Abstract:  We apply the influence-functional method of Feynman and Vernon to the study of a single-mode optical field that interacts with an environment at zero temperature. Using the coherent-state formalism of the path integral, we derive a generalized master equation for the single-mode optical field. Our analysis explicitly shows how non-Markovian effects manifest in the exact decoherence dynamics for different environmental correlation time scales. Remarkably, when these are equal to or greater than the time scale for significant change in the system, the interplay between the backaction-induced coherent oscillation and the dissipative effect of the environment causes the non-Markovian effect to have a significant impact not only on the short-time behavior but also on the long-time steady-state behavior of the system. 
0808.03179	Possible Detection of Causality Violation in a Non-local Scalar Model	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Asrarul Haque, Satish D. Joglekar	Abstract:  We consider the possibility that there may be causality violation detectable at higher energies. We take a scalar nonlocal theory containing a mass scale $Λ$ as a model example and make a preliminary study of how the causality violation can be observed. We show how to formulate an observable whose detection would signal causality violation. We study the range of energies (relative to $Λ$) and couplings to which the observable can be used.

The proof uses the Fourier localization technique and the losing derivative estimates. 
0808.03181	Spontaneous Breaking of Lorentz-Invariance and Gravitons as Goldstone Particles	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Z. Berezhiani, O. V. Kancheli	Abstract:  We consider some aspects of spontaneous breaking of Lorentz Invariance in field theories, discussing the possibility that the certain tensor operators may condensate in the ground state in which case the tensor Goldstone particles would appear. We analyze their dynamics and discuss to which extent such a theory could imitate the gravity. We are also interested if the universality of coupling of such `gravitons' with other particles can be achieved in the infrared limit. Then we address the more complicated models when such tensor Goldstones coexist with the usual geometrical gravitons. At the end we examine the properties of possible cosmological scenarios in the case of goldstone gravity coexisting with geometrical gravity. 
0808.03182	Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati Cosmology in Bianchi I brane	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Rizwan Ul Haq Ansari, P K Suresh	Abstract:  The dynamics of Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati Cosmology (DGP) braneworld with an anisotropic brane is studied. The Friedmann equations and their solutions are obtained for two branches of anisotropic DGP model. The late time behavior in DGP cosmology is examined in the presence of anisotropy which shows that universe enters a self-accelerating phase much later compared to the isotropic case. The acceleration conditions and slow-roll conditions for inflation are obtained. 
0808.03183	Semiconductor split-ring resonators for thermally tunable, terahertz metamaterials	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Jiaguang Han, Akhlesh Lakhtakia	Abstract:  As the variation of temperature alters the intrinsic carrier density in a semiconductor, numerical simulations indicate that the consequent variation of the relative permittivity in the terahertz regime provides a way to realize thermally tunable split-ring resonators. Electromagnetic metasurfaces and metamaterials that are thermally tunable in the terahertz regime can thus be implemented. 
0808.03184	Thermal fluctuations and phase diagrams of the phase field crystal model with pinning	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:J.A.P. Ramos, E. Granato, C.V. Achim, S.C. Ying, K.R. Elder, T. Ala-Nissila	Abstract:  We study the influence of thermal fluctuations in the phase diagram of a recently introduced two-dimensional phase field crystal model with an external pinning potential. The model provides a continuum description of pinned lattice systems allowing for both elastic deformations and topological defects. We introduce a non-conserved version of the model and determine the ground-state phase diagram as a function of lattice mismatch and strength of the pinning potential. Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine the phase diagram as a function of temperature near commensurate phases. The results show a rich phase diagram with commensurate, incommensurate and liquid-like phases with a topology strongly dependent on the type of ordered structure. A finite-size scaling analysis of the melting transition for the $c(2 \times 2)$ commensurate phase shows that the thermal correlation length exponent $ν$ and specific heat behavior are consistent with the Ising universality class as expected from analytical arguments. 
0808.03185	Gamma-Ray Studies of Blazars: Synchro-Compton Analysis of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Charles D. Dermer, Justin D. Finke, Hannah Krug, Markus Boettcher	Abstract:  We extend a method for modeling synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton radiations in blazar jets to include external Compton processes. The basic model assumption is that the blazar radio through soft X-ray flux is nonthermal synchrotron radiation emitted by isotropically-distributed electrons in the randomly directed magnetic field of outflowing relativistic blazar jet plasma. Thus the electron distribution is given by the synchrotron spectrum, depending only on the Doppler factor $δ_{\rm D}$ and mean magnetic field $B$, given that the comoving emission region size scale $R_b^\prime \lesssim c \dD t_v/(1+z)$, where $t_v$ is variability time and $z$ is source redshift. Generalizing the approach of Georganopoulos, Kirk, and Mastichiadis (2001) to arbitrary anisotropic target radiation fields, we use the electron spectrum implied by the synchrotron component to derive accurate Compton-scattered $γ$-ray spectra throughout the Thomson and Klein-Nishina regimes for external Compton scattering processes. We derive and calculate accurate $γ$-ray spectra produced by relativistic electrons that Compton-scatter (i) a point source of radiation located radially behind the jet, (ii) photons from a thermal Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk and (iii) target photons from the central source scattered by a spherically-symmetric shell of broad line region (BLR) gas. Calculations of broadband spectral energy distributions from the radio through $γ$-ray regimes are presented, which include self-consistent $γγ$ absorption on the same radiation fields that provide target photons for Compton scattering. Application of this baseline flat spectrum radio/$γ$-ray quasar model is considered in view of data from $γ$-ray telescopes and contemporaneous multi-wavelength campaigns. 
0808.03186	Tunneling with negative tension	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Kate Marvel, Daniel Wesley	Abstract:  We describe a new family of thin-wall instantons, with negative tension bubble walls, that mediate tunneling between Minkowski or de Sitter vacua. Some of these instantons can have exponentially enhanced tunneling rates, and would dominate the Euclidean path integral, representing a severe non-perturbative instability in any theory which supports them. We give two constructions of these instantons in theories which are perturbatively stable, but violate the null energy condition. One construction uses a scalar field theory with higher-derivative kinetic term, and is similar to the Coleman-de Luccia positive tension instanton. The other construction employs a negative-tension boundary arising from Z_2 orbifolding: it resembles a "bubble of nothing" which nucleates and grows, consuming the surrounding de Sitter or Minkowski spacetime. We explain how the spectral flow for fluctutations about the thin-wall tunneling solutions automatically protects causality, for both positive and negative tension instantons. We comment briefly on the relation of these solutions to a Kalzua-Klein "bubble of nothing," cosmological models relying on ghost condensates, and string theory orientifolds. 
0808.03187	The Annihilating-Ideal Graph of Commutative Rings I	Commutative Algebra (math.AC)	Authors:Mahmood Behboodi, Zahra Rakeei	Abstract:  Let $R$ be a commutative ring with ${\Bbb{A}}(R)$ its set of ideals with nonzero annihilator. In this paper and its sequel, we introduce and investigate the {\it annihilating-ideal graph} of $R$, denoted by ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$. It is the (undirected) graph with vertices ${\Bbb{A}}(R)^*:={\Bbb{A}}(R)\setminus\{(0)\}$, and two distinct vertices $I$ and $J$ are adjacent if and only if $IJ=(0)$. First, we study some finiteness conditions of ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$. For instance, it is shown that if $R$ is not a domain, then ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$ has ACC (resp., DCC) on vertices if and only if $R$ is Noetherian (resp., Artinian). Moreover, the set of vertices of ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$ and the set of nonzero proper ideals of $R$ have the same cardinality when $R$ is either an Artinian or a decomposable ring. This yields for a ring $R$, ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$ has $n$ vertices $(n\geq 1)$ if and only if $R$ has only $n$ nonzero proper ideals. Next, we study the connectivity of ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$. It is shown that ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$ is a connected graph and $diam(\Bbb{AG})(R)\leq 3$ and if ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$ contains a cycle, then $gr({\Bbb{AG}}(R))\leq 4$. Also, rings $R$ for which the graph ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$ is complete or star, are characterized, as well as rings $R$ for which every vertex of ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$ is a prime (or maximal) ideal. In Part II we shall study the diameter and coloring of annihilating-ideal graphs. 
0808.03188	The Science of Galaxy Formation	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Gerard Gilmore	Abstract:  Our knowledge of the Universe remains discovery-led: in the absence of adequate physics-based theory, interpretation of new results requires a scientific methodology. Commonly, scientific progress in astrophysics is motivated by the empirical success of the "Copernican Principle", that the simplest and most objective analysis of observation leads to progress. A complementary approach tests the prediction of models against observation. In practise, astrophysics has few real theories, and has little control over what we can observe. Compromise is unavoidable. Advances in understanding complex non-linear situations, such as galaxy formation, require that models attempt to isolate key physical properties, rather than trying to reproduce complexity. A specific example is discussed, where substantial progress in fundamental physics could be made with an ambitious approach to modelling: simulating the spectrum of perturbations on small scales. 
0808.03189	The Annihilating-Ideal Graph of Commutative Rings II	Commutative Algebra (math.AC)	Authors:Mahmood Behboodi, Zahra Rakeei	Abstract:  In this paper we continue our study of annihilating-ideal graph of commutative rings, that was introduced in Part I (see [5]). Let $R$ be a commutative ring with ${\Bbb{A}}(R)$ its set of ideals with nonzero annihilator and $Z(R)$ its set of zero divisors. The annihilating-ideal graph of $R$ is defined as the (undirected) graph ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$ that its vertices are $\Bbb{A}(R)^* =\Bbb{A}(R)\hspace{-1mm}\setminus\{(0)\}$ in which for every distinct vertices $I$ and $J$, $I\hspace{-0.6mm}-\hspace{-1.7mm}-\hspace{-1.7mm}-\hspace{-0.5mm}J$ is an edge if and only if $IJ=(0)$. First, we study the diameter of ${\Bbb{AG}}(R)$. A complete characterization for the possible diameter is given exclusively in terms of the ideals of $R$ when either $R$ is a Noetherian ring or $Z(R)$ is not an ideal of $R$. Next, we study coloring of annihilating-ideal graphs. Among other results, we characterize when either $χ({\Bbb{AG}}(R))\leq 2$ or $R$ is reduced and $χ({\Bbb{AG}}(R))\leq \infty$. Also it is shown that for each reduced ring $R$, $χ(\Bbb{AG}(R))= cl(\Bbb{AG}(R))$. Moreover, if $χ(\Bbb{AG}(R))$ is finite, then $R$ has a finite number of minimal primes, and if $n$ is this number, then $χ(\Bbb{AG}(R))= cl(\Bbb{AG}(R))= n$. Finally, we show that for a Noetherian ring $R$, $cl(\Bbb{AG}(R))$ is finite if and only if for every ideal $I$ of $R$ with $I^2=(0)$, $I$ has finite number of $R$-submodules. 
0808.03190	An Extensive, Sensitive Search for SiO Masers in High- and Intermediate-Mass Star-Forming Regions	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Luis A. Zapata, Karl Menten (MPIfR), Mark Reid (CfA), Henrik Beuther (MPIfA)    	Abstract:  We present sensitive Very Large Array observations with an angular resolution of a few arcseconds of the $J= 1 - 0$ line of SiO in the $v$=1 and 2 vibrationally excited states toward a sample of 60 Galactic regions in which stars of high or intermediate mass are currently forming and/or have recently formed. We report the detection of SiO maser emission in \textit{both} vibrationally excited transitions toward only three very luminous regions: Orion-KL, W51N and Sgr B2(M). Toward all three, SiO maser emission had previously been reported, in Orion-KL in both lines, in W51N only in the $v=2$ line and in Sgr B2(M) only in the $v=1$ line. Our work confirms that SiO maser emission in star-forming regions is a rare phenomenon, indeed, that requires special, probably extreme, physical and chemical conditions not commonly found. In addition to this SiO maser survey, we also present images of the simultaneously observed 7 mm continuum emission from a subset of our sample of star-forming regions where such emission was detected. This is in most cases likely to be free-free emission from compact- and ultracompact-HII regions. 
0808.03191	Size dependent oscillator strength and quantum efficiency of CdSe quantum dots determined by controlling the local density of states	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:M. D. Leistikow, J. Johansen, A. J. Kettelarij, P. Lodahl, W. L. Vos	Abstract:  We study experimentally time-resolved emission of CdSe quantum dots in an environment with a controlled local density of states (LDOS). The decay rate is measured versus frequency and as a function of distance to a mirror. We observe a linear relation between the decay rate and the LDOS, allowing us to determine the size-dependent quantum efficiency and oscillator strength. We find that the quantum efficiency decreases with increasing emission energy mostly due to an increase in nonradiative decay. For the first time, we manage to obtain the oscillator strength of the important class of CdSe quantum dots. The oscillator strength varies weakly with frequency in agreement with behavior of quantum dots in the strong confinement limit. Surprisingly, the measured absolute values are a factor of 5 below theoretically calculated values. Our results are relevant for applications of CdSe quantum dots in spontaneous emission control and cavity quantum electrodynamics. 
0808.03192	Entropy and chaos in the Kac model	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:E.A. Carlen, M.C. Carvalho, J. Le Roux, M. Loss, C. Villani	Abstract:  We investigate the behavior in $N$ of the $N$--particle entropy functional for Kac's stochastic model of Boltzmann dynamics, and its relation to the entropy function for solutions of Kac's one dimensional nonlinear model Boltzmann equation. We prove a number of results that bring together the notion of propagation of chaos, which Kac introduced in the context of this model, with the problem of estimating the rate of equilibration in the model in entropic terms, and obtain a bound showing that the entropic rate of convergence can be arbitrarily slow. Results proved here show that one can in fact use entropy production bounds in Kac's stochastic model to obtain entropic convergence bounds for his non linear model Boltzmann equation, though the problem of obtaining optimal lower bounds of this sort for the original Kac model remains open, and the upper bounds obtained here show that this problem is somewhat subtle. 
0808.03193	Nonlinear theory of resonant slow waves in anisotropic and dispersive plasmas	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Christopher Clack, Istvan Ballai	Abstract:  The solar corona is a typical example of a plasma with strongly anisotropic transport processes. The main dissipative mechanisms in the solar corona acting on slow magnetoacoustic waves are the anisotropic thermal conductivity and viscosity. Ballai et al. [Phys. Plasmas 5, 252 (1998)] developed the nonlinear theory of driven slow resonant waves in such a regime. In the present paper the nonlinear behaviour of driven magnetohydrodynamic waves in the slow dissipative layer in plasmas with strongly anisotropic viscosity and thermal conductivity is expanded by considering dispersive effects due to Hall currents. The nonlinear governing equation describing the dynamics of nonlinear resonant slow waves is supplemented by a term which describes nonlinear dispersion and is of the same order of magnitude as nonlinearity and dissipation. The connection formulae are found to be similar to their non-dispersive counterparts. 
0808.03194	Nonparametric goodness-of fit testing in quantum homodyne tomography with noisy data	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Katia Meziani	Abstract:  In the framework of quantum optics, we study the problem of goodness-of-fit testing in a severely ill-posed inverse problem. A novel testing procedure is introduced and its rates of convergence are investigated under various smoothness assumptions. The procedure is derived from a projection-type estimator, where the projection is done in $\mathbb{L}_2$ distance on some suitably chosen pattern functions. The proposed methodology is illustrated with simulated data sets. 
0808.03195	Oblique Ion Two-Stream Instability in the Foot Region of a Collisionless Shock	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yutaka Ohira, Fumio Takahara	Abstract:  Electrostatic behavior of a collisionless plasma in the foot region of high Mach number perpendicular shocks is investigated through the two-dimensional linear analysis and electrostatic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. The simulations are double periodic and taken as a proxy for the situation in the foot. The linear analysis for relatively cold unmagnetized plasmas with a reflected proton beam shows that obliquely propagating Buneman instability is strongly excited. We also found that when the electron temperature is much higher than the proton temperature, the most unstable mode is the highly obliquely propagating ion two-stream instability excited through the resonance between ion plasma oscillations of the background protons and of the beam protons, rather than the ion acoustic instability that is dominant for parallel propagation. To investigate nonlinear behavior of the ion two-stream instability, we have made PIC simulations for the shock foot region in which the initial state satisfies the Buneman instability condition. In the first phase, electrostatic waves grow two-dimensionally by the Buneman instability to heat electrons. In the second phase, highly oblique ion two-stream instability grows to heat mainly ions. This result is in contrast to previous studies based on one-dimensional simulations, for which ion acoustic instability further heats electrons. The present result implies that overheating problem of electrons for shocks in supernova remnants is resolved by considering ion two-stream instability propagating highly obliquely to the shock normal and that multi-dimensional analysis is crucial to understand the particle heating and acceleration processes in shocks. 
0808.03196	Queue-length Variations In A Two-Restaurant Problem	Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)	Authors:Anindya S. Chakrabarti, Bikas K. Chakrabarti	Abstract:  This paper attempts to find out numerically the distribution of the queue-length ratio in the context of a model of preferential attachment. Here we consider two restaurants only and a large number of customers (agents) who come to these restaurants. Each day the same number of agents sequentially arrives and decides which restaurant to enter. If all the agents literally follow the crowd then there is no difference between this model and the famous `Pólya's Urn' model. But as agents alter their strategies different kind of dynamics of the model is seen. It is seen from numerical results that the existence of a distribution of the fixed points is quite robust and it is also seen that in some cases the variations in the ratio of the queue-lengths follow a power-law. 
0808.03197	On the Monotonicity of Work Function in k-Server Conjecture	Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)	Authors:Ming-Zhe Chen	Abstract:  This paper presents a mistake in work function algorithm of k-server conjecture. That is, the monotonicity of the work function is not always true. 
0808.03198	Electron Beam Supercollimation in Graphene Superlattices	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Cheol-Hwan Park, Young-Woo Son, Li Yang, Marvin L. Cohen, Steven G. Louie	Abstract:  Although electrons and photons are intrinsically different, importing useful concepts in optics to electronics performing similar functions has been actively pursued over the last two decades. In particular, collimation of an electron beam is a long-standing goal. We show that ballistic propagation of an electron beam with virtual no spatial spreading or diffraction, without a waveguide or external magnetic field, can be achieved in graphene under an appropriate class of experimentally feasible one-dimensional external periodic potentials. The novel chiral quasi-one-dimensional metallic state that the charge carriers are in originates from a collapse of the intrinsic helical nature of the charge carriers in graphene owing to the superlattice potential. Beyond providing a new way to constructing chiral one-dimensional states in two dimensions, our findings should be useful in graphene-based electronic devices (e.g., for information processing) utilizing some of the highly developed concepts in optics. 
0808.03199	Gas Sensing Properties of Single Conducting Polymer Nanowires and the Effect of Temperature	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Yaping Dan, Yanyan Cao, Tom E. Mallouk, Stephane Evoy, A. T. Charlie Johnson,     	Abstract:  We measured the electronic properties and gas sensing responses of template-grown poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT/PSS)-based nanowires. The nanowires have a "striped" structure (gold-PEDOT/PSS-gold), typically 8um long (1um-6um-1um for each section, respectively) and 220 nm in diameter. Single-nanowire devices were contacted by pre-fabricated gold electrodes using dielectrophoretic assembly. A polymer conductivity of 11.5 +/- 0.7 S/cm and a contact resistance of 27.6 +/- 4 kOhm were inferred from measurements of nanowires of varying length and diameter. The nanowire sensors detect a variety of odors, with rapid response and recovery (seconds). The response (R-R0)/R0 varies as a power law with analyte concentration. 
0808.03200	Multifactor Analysis of Multiscaling in Volatility Return Intervals	Statistical Finance (q-fin.ST)	Authors:Fengzhong Wang, Kazuko Yamasaki, Shlomo Havlin, H. Eugene Stanley	Abstract:  We study the volatility time series of 1137 most traded stocks in the US stock markets for the two-year period 2001-02 and analyze their return intervals $τ$, which are time intervals between volatilities above a given threshold $q$. We explore the probability density function of $τ$, $P_q(τ)$, assuming a stretched exponential function, $P_q(τ) \sim e^{-τ^γ}$. We find that the exponent $γ$ depends on the threshold in the range between $q=1$ and 6 standard deviations of the volatility. This finding supports the multiscaling nature of the return interval distribution. To better understand the multiscaling origin, we study how $γ$ depends on four essential factors, capitalization, risk, number of trades and return. We show that $γ$ depends on the capitalization, risk and return but almost does not depend on the number of trades. This suggests that $γ$ relates to the portfolio selection but not on the market activity. To further characterize the multiscaling of individual stocks, we fit the moments of $τ$, $μ_m \equiv <(τ/<τ>)^m>^{1/m}$, in the range of $10 < <τ> \le 100$ by a power-law, $μ_m \sim <τ>^δ$. The exponent $δ$ is found also to depend on the capitalization, risk and return but not on the number of trades, and its tendency is opposite to that of $γ$. Moreover, we show that $δ$ decreases with $γ$ approximately by a linear relation. The return intervals demonstrate the temporal structure of volatilities and our findings suggest that their multiscaling features may be helpful for portfolio optimization. 
0808.03201	High Angular Resolution Observations at 7-mm of the Core of the Quadrupolar HH 111/121 Outflow	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:L. F. Rodriguez, J. M. Torrelles, G. Anglada, B. Reipurth	Abstract:  We present sensitive, high angular resolution ($0\rlap.{''}05$) VLA continuum observations made at 7 mm of the core of the HH 111/121 quadrupolar outflow. We estimate that at this wavelength the continuum emission is dominated by dust, although a significant free-free contribution ($\sim$30%) is still present. The observed structure is formed by two overlapping, elongated sources approximately perpendicular to each other as viewed from Earth. We interpret this structure as either tracing two circumstellar disks that exist around each of the protostars of the close binary source at the core of this quadrupolar outflow or a disk and a jet perpendicular to it. Both interpretations have advantages and disadvantages, and future high angular resolution spectroscopic millimeter observations are required to favor one of them in a more conclusive way.

0808.03203	Sex is always well worth its two-fold cost	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:Alexander Feigel, Avraham Englander, Assaf Engel	Abstract:  Sex is considered as an evolutionary paradox, since its evolutionary advantage does not necessarily overcome the two fold cost of sharing half of one's offspring's genome with another member of the population. Here we demonstrate that sexual reproduction can be evolutionary stable even when its Darwinian fitness is twice as low when compared to the fitness of asexual mutants. We also show that more than two sexes are always evolutionary unstable. Our approach generalizes the evolutionary game theory to analyze species whose members are able to sense the sexual state of their conspecifics and to switch sexes consequently. The widespread emergence and maintenance of sex follows therefore from its co-evolution with even more widespread environmental sensing abilities. 
0808.03204	Symplectic polynomial invariants of one or two matrices of small size	Commutative Algebra (math.AC)	Authors:Dragomir Z. Djokovic	Abstract:  The algebra of holomorphic polynomial Sp_{2n}-invariants of k complex 2n by 2n matrices (under diagonal conjugation action) is generated by the traces of words in these matrices and their symplectic adjoints. No concrete minimal generating set is known for this algebra apart from the cases n=1, when Sp_2=SL_2, and n=2, k=1. We construct such sets in the cases n=k=2 and n=3, k=1. In the latter case we also construct a homogeneous system of parameters and a Hironaka decomposition of the algebra. 
0808.03205	Compression and stretching of a self-avoiding chain in cylindrical nanopores	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Suckjoon Jun, D. Thirumalai, Bae-Yeun Ha	Abstract:  Force-induced deformations of a self-avoiding chain confined inside a cylindrical cavity, with diameter $D$, are probed using molecular dynamics simulations, scaling analysis, and analytical calculations. We obtain and confirm a simple scaling relation $-f \cdot D \sim R^{-9/4}$ in the strong-compression regime, while for weak deformations we find $f \cdot D = -A(R/R_0) + B (R/R_0)^{-2}$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants, $f$ the external force, and $R$ the chain extension (with $R_0$ its unperturbed value). For a strong stretch, we present a universal, analytical force-extension relation. Our results can be used to analyze the behavior of biomolecules in confinement.

0808.03207	Chamaeleon	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Kevin L. Luhman	Abstract:  The dark clouds in the constellation of Chamaeleon have distances of 160-180 pc from the Sun and a total mass of ~5000 M_sun. The three main clouds, Cha I, II, and III, have angular sizes of a few square degrees and maximum extinctions of A_V=5-10. Most of the star formation in these clouds is occurring in Cha I, with the remainder in Cha II. The current census of Cha I contains 237 known members, 33 of which have spectral types indicative of brown dwarfs (>M6). Approximately 50 members of Cha II have been identified, including a few brown dwarfs. When interpreted with the evolutionary models of Chabrier and Baraffe, the H-R diagram for Cha I exhibits a median age of ~2 Myr, making it coeval with IC 348 and slightly older than Taurus (~1 Myr). The IMF of Cha I reaches a maximum at a mass of 0.1-0.15 M_sun, and thus closely resembles the IMFs in IC 348 and the Orion Nebula Cluster. The disk fraction in Cha I is roughly constant at ~50% from 0.01 to 0.3 M_sun and increases to ~65% at higher masses. In comparison, IC 348 has a similar disk fraction at low masses but a much lower disk fraction at M>1 M_sun, indicating that solar-type stars have longer disk lifetimes in Cha I. 
0808.03208	Maximizing orbits for higher dimensional convex billiards	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Michael Bialy	Abstract:  The main result of this paper is, that for convex billiards in higher dimensions, in contrast with 2D case, for every point on the boundary and for every $n$ there always exist billiard trajectories developing conjugate points at the $n$-th collision with the boundary. We shall explain that this is a consequence of the following variational property of the billiard orbits in higher dimension. If a segment of an orbit is locally maximizing, then it can not pass too close to the boundary. This fact follows from the second variation formula for the Length functional. It turns out that this formula behaves differently with respect to "longitudinal" and "transversal" variations. 
0808.03209	Baric structures on triangulated categories and coherent sheaves	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Pramod N. Achar, David Treumann	Abstract:  We introduce the notion of a "baric structure" on a triangulated category, as an abstraction of S. Morel's weight truncation formalism for mixed l-adic sheaves. We study these structures on the derived category D_G(X) of G-equivariant coherent sheaves on a G-scheme X. Our main result shows how to endow this derived category with a family of nontrivial baric structures when G acts on X with finitely many orbits. We also describe a general construction for producing a new t-structure on a triangulated category equipped with given t- and baric structures, and we prove that the staggered t-structures on D_G(X) introduced by the first author arise in this way. 
0808.03210	Purity and decomposition theorems for staggered sheaves	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Pramod N. Achar, David Treumann	Abstract:  Two major results in the theory of l-adic mixed constructible sheaves are the purity theorem (every simple perverse sheaf is pure) and the decomposition theorem (every pure object in the derived category is a direct sum of shifts of simple perverse sheaves). In this paper, we prove analogues of these results for coherent sheaves. Specificially, we work with staggered sheaves, which form the heart of a certain t-structure on the derived category of equivariant coherent sheaves. We prove, under some reasonable hypotheses, that every simple staggered sheaf is pure, and that every pure complex of coherent sheaves is a direct sum of shifts of simple staggered sheaves. 
0808.03211	Quantum transport thermometry for electrons in graphene	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:K. Kechedzhi, D. W. Horsell, F. V. Tikhonenko, A. K. Savchenko, R. V. Gorbachev, I. V. Lerner, V. I. Fal'ko	Abstract:  We propose a method of measuring the electron temperature $T_e$ in mesoscopic conductors and demonstrate experimentally its applicability to micron-size graphene devices in the linear-response regime ($T_e\approx T$, the bath temperature). The method can be {especially useful} in case of overheating, $T_e>T$. It is based on analysis of the correlation function of mesoscopic conductance fluctuations. Although the fluctuation amplitude strongly depends on the details of electron scattering in graphene, we show that $T_e$ extracted from the correlation function is insensitive to these details. 
0808.03212	Quantum Control via Geometry: An explicit example	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Mile Gu, Andrew Doherty, Michael Nielsen	Abstract:  We explicitly compute the optimal cost for a class of example problems in geometric quantum control. These problems are defined by a Cartan decomposition of $su(2^n)$ into orthogonal subspaces $\mathfrak{l}$ and $\mathfrak{p}$ such that $[\mathfrak{l},\mathfrak{l}] \subseteq \mathfrak{p}, [\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{l}] = \mathfrak{p}, [\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{p}] \subseteq \mathfrak{l}$. Motion in the $\mathfrak{l}$ direction are assumed to have negligible cost, where motion in the $\mathfrak{p}$ direction do not. In the special case of two qubits, our results correspond to the minimal interaction cost of a given unitary. 
0808.03213	High M/L ratios of UCDs: a variation of the IMF?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Mieske, J. Dabringhausen, P. Kroupa, M. Hilker, H. Baumgardt	Abstract:  Various studies have established that the dynamical M/L ratios of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) tend to be at the limit or beyond the range explicable by standard stellar populations with canonical IMF. We discuss how IMF variations may account for these high M/L ratios and how observational approaches may in the future allow to discriminate between those possibilities. We also briefly discuss the possibility of dark matter in UCDs. 
0808.03214	The discrete Fourier transform: A canonical basis of eigenfunctions	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Shamgar Gurevich, Ronny Hadani, Nir Sochen	Abstract:  The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is an important operator which acts on the Hilbert space of complex valued functions on the ring Z/NZ. In the case where N=p is an odd prime number, we exhibit a canonical basis of eigenvectors for the DFT. The transition matrix from the standard basis to the canonical basis defines a novel transform which we call the "discrete oscillator transform" (DOT for short). Finally, we describe a fast algorithm for computing the DOT in certain cases. 
0808.03215	Quantitative Description of Strong-Coupling of Quantum Dots in Microcavities	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:F.P. Laussy, E. del Valle, C. Tejedor	Abstract:  We have recently developed a self-consistent theory of Strong-Coupling in the presence of an incoherent pumping [arXiv:0807.3194] and shown how it could reproduce quantitatively the experimental data [PRL 101, 083601 (2008)]. Here, we summarize our main results, provide the detailed analysis of the fitting of the experiment and discuss how the field should now evolve beyond merely qualitative expectations, that could well be erroneous even when they seem to be firmly established. 
0808.03216	Defects in Four-Dimensional Continua: A Paradigm for the Expansion of the Universe?	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:A. Tartaglia	Abstract:  The presence of defects in material continua is known to produce internal permanent strained states. Extending the theory of defects to four dimensions and allowing for the appropriate signature, it is possible to apply these concepts to space-time. In this case a defect would induce a non-trivial metric tensor, which can be interpreted as a gravitational field. The image of a defect in space-time can be applied to the description of the Big Bang. A review of the four-dimensional generalisation of defects and an application to the expansion of the universe will be presented. 
0808.03217	Driven particle in a random landscape: disorder correlator, avalanche distribution and extreme value statistics of records	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:Pierre Le Doussal, Kay Joerg Wiese	Abstract:  We review how the renormalized force correlator Delta(u), the function computed in the functional RG field theory, can be measured directly in numerics and experiments on the dynamics of elastic manifolds in presence of pinning disorder. We show how this function can be computed analytically for a particle dragged through a 1-dimensional random-force landscape. The limit of small velocity allows to access the critical behavior at the depinning transition. For uncorrelated forces one finds three universality classes, corresponding to the three extreme value statistics, Gumbel, Weibull, and Frechet. For each class we obtain analytically the universal function Delta(u), the corrections to the critical force, and the joint probability distribution of avalanche sizes s and waiting times w. We find P(s)=P(w) for all three cases. All results are checked numerically. For a Brownian force landscape, known as the ABBM model, avalanche distributions and Delta(u) can be computed for any velocity. For 2-dimensional disorder, we perform large-scale numerical simulations to calculate the renormalized force correlator tensor Delta_{ij}(u), and to extract the anisotropic scaling exponents zeta_x > zeta_y. We also show how the Middleton theorem is violated. Our results are relevant for the record statistics of random sequences with linear trends, as encountered e.g. in some models of global warming. We give the joint distribution of the time s between two successive records and their difference in value w. 
0808.03218	Balanced HKT metrics and strong HKT metrics on hypercomplex manifolds	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Misha Verbitsky	Abstract:  A manifold (M,I,J,K) is called hypercomplex if I,J,K are complex structures satisfying quaternionic relations. A quaternionic Hermitian metric is called HKT (hyperkaehler with torsion) if $Idω_I = Jd ω_J=Kdω_K$, where $ω_I,ω_J, ω_K$ are Hermitian forms associated with I, J, K. A Hermitian metric $ω$ on a complex manifold is called balanced if $d^*ω=0$. We show that balanced HKT metrics are precisely the quaternionic Calabi-Yau metrics defined in terms of the quaternionic Monge-Ampere equation. In particular, a balanced HKT-metric is unique in its cohomology class, and it always exists if the quaternionic Calabi-Yau theorem is true. We investigate the cohomological properties of strong HKT metrics (the quaternionic Hermitian metrics, satisfying, in addition to the HKT condition, the relation $dd^c ω=0$), and show that the space of strong HKT metrics is finite-dimensional. Using Howe's duality for representations of Sp(n), we prove a hyperkaehler version of Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations. We use it to show that a manifold admitting a balanced HKT-metric never admits a strong HKT-metric, if $\dim_\R M \geq 12$. 
0808.03219	Zakharov-Shabat system and hyperbolic pseudoanalytic function theory	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Viktor G. Kravchenko, Vladislav V. Kravchenko, Sébastien Tremblay	Abstract:  In [1] a hyperbolic analogue of pseudoanalytic function theory was developed. In the present contribution we show that one of the central objects of the inverse problem method the Zakharov-Shabat system is closely related to a hyperbolic Vekua equation for which among other results a generating sequence and hence a complete system of formal powers can be constructed explicitly. 
0808.03220	Open book decompositions and stable Hamiltonian structures	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Chris Wendl	Abstract:  We show that every open book decomposition of a contact 3-manifold can be represented (up to isotopy) by a smooth R-invariant family of pseudoholomorphic curves on its symplectization with respect to a suitable stable Hamiltonian structure. In the planar case, this family survives small perturbations, and thus gives a concrete construction of a stable finite energy foliation that has been used in various applications to planar contact manifolds, including the Weinstein conjecture and equivalence of strong and Stein fillability. 
0808.03221	Can optical afterglows be used to discriminate between Type I and Type II GRBs?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:D. A. Kann	Abstract:  The precise localization of short/hard (Type I) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in recent years has answered many questions but raised even more. I present some results of a systematic study of the optical afterglows of long/soft (Type II) and short/hard (Type I) GRBs, focusing on the optical luminosity as another puzzle piece in the classification of GRBs. 
0808.03222	Analysis of the postulates produced by Karp's Theorem	Computational Complexity (cs.CC)	Authors:Jerrald Meek	Abstract:  This is the final article in a series of four articles. Richard Karp has proven that a deterministic polynomial time solution to K-SAT will result in a deterministic polynomial time solution to all NP-Complete problems. However, it is demonstrated that a deterministic polynomial time solution to any NP-Complete problem does not necessarily produce a deterministic polynomial time solution to all NP-Complete problems. 
0808.03223	Isoscaling and the high Temperature limit	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:C. O. Dorso, C. M. Hernández, J. A. López, J. A. Muñoz	Abstract:  This study shows that isoscaling, usually studied in nuclear reactions, is a phenomenon common to all cases of fair sampling. Exact expressions for the yield ratio $R_{21}$ and approximate expressions for the isoscaling parameters $α$ and $β$ are obtained and compared to experimental results. It is concluded that nuclear isoscaling is bound to contain a component due to sampling and, thus, a words of caution is issued to those interested in extracting information about the nuclear equation of state from isoscaling. 
0808.03224	The Kuiper Belt and Other Debris Disks	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:David Jewitt, Amaya Moro-Martín, Pedro Lacerda	Abstract:  We discuss the current knowledge of the Solar system, focusing on bodies in the outer regions, on the information they provide concerning Solar system formation, and on the possible relationships that may exist between our system and the debris disks of other stars. Beyond the domains of the Terrestrial and giant planets, the comets in the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud preserve some of our most pristine materials. The Kuiper belt, in particular, is a collisional dust source and a scientific bridge to the dusty "debris disks" observed around many nearby main-sequence stars. Study of the Solar system provides a level of detail that we cannot discern in the distant disks while observations of the disks may help to set the Solar system in proper context. 
0808.03225	Entire curves, Integral sets and Principal bundles	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Joerg Winkelmann	Abstract:  We compare the behaviour of entire curves and integral sets, in particular in relation to locally trivial fiber bundles, algebraic groups and finite ramified covers over semi-abelian varieties. 
0808.03226	A Molecular Line Survey of the Highly Evolved Carbon Star CIT 6	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yong Zhang, Sun Kwok, Dinh-V-Trung	Abstract:  We present a spectral line survey of the C-rich envelope CIT 6 in the 2mm and 1.3mm bands carried out with the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO) 12m telescope and the Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter Telescope (SMT). The observations cover the frequency ranges of 131--160 GHz, 219--244 GHz, and 252--268 GHz with typical sensitivity limit of T_R<10 mK. A total of 74 individual emission features are detected, of which 69 are identified to arise from 21 molecular species and isotopologues, with 5 faint lines remaining unidentified. Two new molecules (C4H and CH3CN) and seven new isotopologues (C17O, 29SiC2, 29SiO, 30SiO, 13CS, C33S, and CS) are detected in this object for the first time. The column densities, excitation temperatures, and fractional abundances of the detected molecules are determined using rotation diagram analysis. Comparison of the spectra of CIT 6 to that of IRC+10216 suggests that the spectral properties of CIT 6 are generally consistent with those of IRC+10216. For most of the molecular species, the intensity ratios of the lines detected in the two objects are in good agreement with each other. Nevertheless, there is evidence suggesting enhanced emission from CN and HC3N and depleted emission from HCN, SiS, and C4H in CIT 6. Based on their far-IR spectra, we find that CIT 6 probably has a lower dust-to-molecular gas ratio than IRC+10216. To investigate the chemical evolution of evolved stars, we compare the molecular abundances in the AGB envelopes CIT 6 and IRC+10216 and those in the bright proto-planetary nebula CRL 618. The implication on the circumstellar chemistry is discussed. 
0808.03227	Observations of Active Region Loops with the EUV Imaging Spectrometer on Hinode	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Harry P. Warren, Ignacio Ugarte-Urra, George A. Doschek, David H. Brooks, David R. Williams	Abstract:  Previous solar observations have shown that coronal loops near 1 MK are difficult to reconcile with simple heating models. These loops have lifetimes that are long relative to a radiative cooling time, suggesting quasi-steady heating. The electron densities in these loops, however, are too high to be consistent with thermodynamic equilibrium. Models proposed to explain these properties generally rely on the existence of smaller scale filaments within the loop that are in various stages of heating and cooling. Such a framework implies that there should be a distribution of temperatures within a coronal loop. In this paper we analyze new observations from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on \textit{Hinode}. EIS is capable of observing active regions over a wide range of temperatures (\ion{Fe}{8}--\ion{Fe}{17}) at relatively high spatial resolution (1\arcsec). We find that most isolated coronal loops that are bright in \ion{Fe}{12} generally have very narrow temperature distributions ($σ_T \lesssim 3\times10^5$ K), but are not isothermal. We also derive volumetric filling factors in these loops of approximately 10%. Both results lend support to the filament models. 
0808.03228	Hydro-Gravitational-Dynamics of Planets and Dark Energy	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Carl H. Gibson (UCSD)Rudolph E. Schild (Harvard)    	Abstract:  Self-gravitational fluid mechanical methods termed hydro-gravitational-dynamics (HGD) predict plasma fragmentation 0.03 Myr after the turbulent big bang to form protosuperclustervoids, turbulent protosuperclusters, and protogalaxies at the 0.3 Myr transition from plasma to gas. Linear protogalaxyclusters fragment at 0.003 Mpc viscous-inertial scales along turbulent vortex lines or in spirals, as observed. The plasma protogalaxies fragment on transition into white-hot planet-mass gas clouds (PFPs) in million-solar-mass clumps (PGCs) that become globular-star-clusters (GCs) from tidal forces or dark matter (PGCs) by freezing and diffusion into 0.3 Mpc halos with 97% of the galaxy mass. The weakly collisional non-baryonic dark matter diffuses to > Mpc scales and frag-ments to form galaxy cluster halos. Stars and larger planets form by binary mergers of the trillion PFPs per PGC on 0.03 Mpc galaxy accretion disks. Star deaths depend on rates of planet accretion and internal star mixing. Moderate accretion rates produce white dwarfs that evaporate surrounding gas planets by spin-radiation to form planetary nebulae before Supernova Ia events, dimming some events to give systematic distance errors misinterpreted as the dark energy hypothesis and overestimates of the universe age. Failures of standard LCDM cosmological models reflect not only obsolete Jeans 1902 fluid mechanical assumptions, but also failures of standard turbulence models that claim the cascade of turbulent kinetic energy is from large scales to small. Because turbulence is always driven at all scales by inertial-vortex forces the turbulence cascade is always from small scales to large. 
0808.03229	Hopping Transport in Hostile Reaction-Diffusion Systems	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:Andrew R. Missel Karin A. Dahmen	Abstract:  We investigate transport in a disordered reaction-diffusion (RD) model consisting of particles which are allowed to diffuse, compete with one another (2A->A), give birth in small areas called "oases" (A->2A), and die in the "desert" outside the oases (A->0). This model has previously been used to study bacterial populations in the lab and is related to a model of plankton populations in the oceans. We first consider the nature of transport between two oases: in the limit of high growth rate, this is effectively a first passage process, and we are able to determine the first passage time probability density function in the limit of large oasis separation. This result is then used along with the theory of hopping conduction in doped semiconductors to estimate the time taken by a population to cross a large system. 
0808.03230	Phase Transitions on Fixed Connected Graphs and Random Graphs in the Presence of Noise	Optimization and Control (math.OC)	Authors:Jialing Liu, Vikas Yadav, Hullas Sehgal, Joshua M. Olson, Haifeng Liu, Nicola Elia	Abstract:  In this paper, we study the phase transition behavior emerging from the interactions among multiple agents in the presence of noise. We propose a simple discrete-time model in which a group of non-mobile agents form either a fixed connected graph or a random graph process, and each agent, taking bipolar value either +1 or -1, updates its value according to its previous value and the noisy measurements of the values of the agents connected to it. We present proofs for the occurrence of the following phase transition behavior: At a noise level higher than some threshold, the system generates symmetric behavior (vapor or melt of magnetization) or disagreement; whereas at a noise level lower than the threshold, the system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking (solid or magnetization) or consensus. The threshold is found analytically. The phase transition occurs for any dimension. Finally, we demonstrate the phase transition behavior and all analytic results using simulations. This result may be found useful in the study of the collective behavior of complex systems under communication constraints. 
0808.03231	Multi-Instance Multi-Label Learning	Machine Learning (cs.LG)	Authors:Zhi-Hua Zhou, Min-Ling Zhang, Sheng-Jun Huang, Yu-Feng Li	Abstract:  In this paper, we propose the MIML (Multi-Instance Multi-Label learning) framework where an example is described by multiple instances and associated with multiple class labels. Compared to traditional learning frameworks, the MIML framework is more convenient and natural for representing complicated objects which have multiple semantic meanings. To learn from MIML examples, we propose the MimlBoost and MimlSvm algorithms based on a simple degeneration strategy, and experiments show that solving problems involving complicated objects with multiple semantic meanings in the MIML framework can lead to good performance. Considering that the degeneration process may lose information, we propose the D-MimlSvm algorithm which tackles MIML problems directly in a regularization framework. Moreover, we show that even when we do not have access to the real objects and thus cannot capture more information from real objects by using the MIML representation, MIML is still useful. We propose the InsDif and SubCod algorithms. InsDif works by transforming single-instances into the MIML representation for learning, while SubCod works by transforming single-label examples into the MIML representation for learning. Experiments show that in some tasks they are able to achieve better performance than learning the single-instances or single-label examples directly. 
0808.03232	Towards Gravity solutions of AdS/CMT	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Shesansu Pal	Abstract:  In this short note, we have generalized and constructed gravity solutions with two "exponents" {\it a la} Kachru, Liu and Mulligan. The coordinate system that is used to construct the gravity solution is useful when $b$ vanishes. It means we can describe the theory having only the temporal scale invariance apart from the combination of both temporal and spatial scale invariance. The two point correlation function of the scalar field in the mass less limit is computed in a special case that is $a/b=2$. 
0808.03233	Topological censorship for Kaluza-Klein space-times	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Piotr T. Chruściel, Gregory J. Galloway, Didier Solis	Abstract:  The standard topological censorship theorems require asymptotic hypotheses which are too restrictive for several situations of interest. In this paper we prove a version of topological censorship under significantly weaker conditions, compatible e.g. with solutions with Kaluza-Klein asymptotic behavior. In particular we prove simple connectedness of the quotient of the domain of outer communications by the group of symmetries for models which are asymptotically flat, or asymptotically anti-de Sitter, in a Kaluza-Klein sense. This allows one, e.g., to define the twist potentials needed for the reduction of the field equations in uniqueness theorems. Finally, the methods used to prove the above are used to show that weakly trapped compact surfaces cannot be seen from Scri. 
0808.03234	Theory for Superconductivity in Iron Pnictides at Large Coulomb U Limit	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Wei-Qiang Chen, Kai-Yu Yang, Yi Zhou, Fu-Chun Zhang	Abstract:  Superconductivity in iron pnictides is studied by using a two-orbital Hubbard model in the large U limit. The Coulomb repulsion induces an orbital-dependent pairing between charge carriers. The pairing is found mainly from the scattering within the same Fermi pocket. The inter-pocket pair scatterings determine the symmetry of the superconductivity, which is extended s-wave at small Hund's coupling, and d-wave at large Hund's coupling and large U. The former is consistent with recent experiments of ARPES and Andreev reflection spectroscope. 
0808.03235	Chen--Ruan cohomology of some moduli spaces	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Indranil Biswas, Mainak Poddar	Abstract:  Let X be a compact connected Riemann surface of genus at least two. We compute the Chen--Ruan cohomology ring of the moduli space of stable PSL(2, C)--bundles of nontrivial second Stiefel--Whitney class over X. 
0808.03236	Coset Space Dimensional Reduction and Wilson Flux Breaking of Ten-Dimensional N=1, E(8) Gauge Theory	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:George Douzas, Theodoros Grammatikopoulos, George Zoupanos	Abstract:  We consider a N=1 supersymmetric E(8) gauge theory, defined in ten dimensions and we determine all four-dimensional gauge theories resulting from the generalized dimensional reduction a la Forgacs-Manton over coset spaces, followed by a subsequent application of the Wilson flux spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism. Our investigation is constrained only by the requirements that (i) the dimensional reduction leads to the potentially phenomenologically interesting, anomaly free, four-dimensional E(6), SO(10) and SU(5) GUTs and (ii) the Wilson flux mechanism makes use only of the freely acting discrete symmetries of all possible six-dimensional coset spaces. 
0808.03237	The role of Dirac equations in the classical mechanics of the relativistic top	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Enrico Santamato	Abstract:  A rigorous \textit{ab initio} derivation of the (square of) Dirac's equation for a single particle with spin is presented. The general Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the particle expressed in terms of a background Weyl's conformal geometry is found to be linearized, exactly and in closed form, by an \textit{ansatz} solution that can be straightforwardly interpreted as the "quantum wave function" $ψ_4$ of the 4-spinor Dirac's equation. In particular, all quantum features of the model arise from a subtle interplay between the conformal curvature of the configuration space acting as a potential and Weyl's "pre-potential" closely related to $ψ_4$, which acts on the particle trajectory. The theory, carried out here by assuming a Minkowsky metric, can be easily extended to arbitrary space-time Riemann metric, e.g. the one adopted in the context of General Relativity. This novel theoretical scenario, referred to as "Affine Quantum Mechanics", appears to be of general application and is expected to open a promising perspective in the modern endeavor aimed at the unification of the natural forces with gravitation. 
0808.03238	Concentration of 1-Lipschitz maps into an infinite dimensional $\ell^p$-ball with $\ell^q$-distance function	Metric Geometry (math.MG)	Authors:Kei Funano	Abstract:  In this paper, we study the Lévy-Milman concentration phenomenon of 1-Lipschitz maps into infinite dimensional metric spaces. Our main theorem asserts that the concentration to an infinite dimensional $\ell^p$-ball with the $\ell^q$-distance function for $1\leq p<q\leq +\infty$ is equivalent to the concentration to the real line. 
0808.03239	Stability of Circular Orbits in General Relativity: A Phase Space Analysis	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:A. Palit, A. Panchenko, N.G. Migranov, A. Bhadra, K.K. Nandi	Abstract:  Phase space method provides a novel way for deducing qualitative features of nonlinear differential equations without actually solving them. The method is applied here for analyzing stability of circular orbits of test particles in various physically interesting environments. The approach is shown to work in a revealing way in Schwarzschild spacetime. All relevant conclusions about circular orbits in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime are shown to be remarkably encoded in a single parameter. The analysis in the rotating Kerr black hole readily exposes information as to how stability depends on the ratio of source rotation to particle angular momentum. As a wider application, it is exemplified how the analysis reveals useful information when applied to motion in a refractive medium, for instance, that of optical black holes. 
0808.03240	New Features of Extended Wormhole Solutions in the Scalar Field Gravity Theories	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Kamal K. Nandi, Ilnur Nigmatzyanov, Ramil Izmailov, Nail G. Migranov	Abstract:  The present paper reports interesting new features that wormhole solutions in the scalar field gravity theory have. To demonstrate these, we obtain, by using a slightly modified form of the Matos-Nunez algorithm, an extended class of asymptotically flat wormhole solutions belonging to Einstein minimally coupled scalar field theory. Generally, solutions in these theories do not represent traversable wormholes due to the occurrence of curvature singularities. However, the Ellis I solution of the Einstein minimally coupled theory, when Wick rotated, yields Ellis class III solution, the latter representing a singularity-free traversable wormhole. We see that Ellis I and III are not essentially independent solutions. The Wick rotated seed solutions, extended by the algorithm, contain two new parameters a and δ;. The effect of the parameter a on the geodesic motion of test particles reveals some remarkable features. By arguing for Sagnac effect in the extended Wick rotated solution, we find that the parameter a can indeed be interpreted as a rotation parameter of the wormhole. The analyses reported here have wider applicability in that they can very well be adopted in other theories, including in the string theory. 
0808.03241	Moduli of Continuity of Quasiregular Mappings	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Vesna Manojlovic	Abstract:  This thesis consists of Chapters 1 and 2. The main results are contained in the two preprints and two published papers, listed below. Chapter 1 deals with conformal invariants in the euclidean space Rn; n >= 2; and their interrelation. In particular, conformally invariant metrics and balls of the respective metric spaces are studied. Another theme in Chapter 1 is the study of quasiconformal maps with identity boundary values in two diferent cases, the unit ball and the whole space minus two points. These results are based on the two preprints: R. Klen, V. Manojlovic and M. Vuorinen: Distortion of two point normalized quasiconformal mappings, arXiv:0808.1219[math.CV], 13 pp., V. Manojlovic and M. Vuorinen: On quasiconformal maps with identity boundary values, arXiv:0807.4418[math.CV], 16 pp. Chapter 2 deals with harmonic quasiregular maps. Topics studied are: Preservation of modulus of continuity, in particular Lipschitz continuity, from the boundary to the interior of domain in case of harmonic quasiregular maps and quasiisometry property of harmonic quasiconformal maps. Chapter 2 is based mainly on the two published papers: M. Arsenovic, V. Kojic and M. Mateljevic: On Lipschitz continuity of harmonic quasiregular maps on the unit ball in Rn., Ann. Acad. Sci. Fenn. Math. 33 (2008), no. 1, 315-318. V. Kojic and M. Pavlovic: Subharmonicity of jfjp for quasiregular harmonic functions, with applications, J. Math. Anal. Appl. 342 (2008) 742-746 
0808.03242	N=8 superfield formulation of the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson model	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Martin Cederwall	Abstract:  We reformulate the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson model using an N=8 superspace, thus making the full supersymmetry manifest. The formulation is based on appropriate "pure spinor wave functions" for the Chern-Simons and matter multiplets. The Lagrangian has an extremely simple structure, essentially containing a Chern-Simons-like term for the gauge field wave function and a minimally coupled matter wave function. No higher order interactions than cubic are present. The consistency of the setup relies on an interplay between the algebraic structures of the 3-algebra and of the pure spinors. 
0808.03243	How complex is the quantum motion?	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Giuliano Benenti, Giulio Casati	Abstract:  In classical mechanics the complexity of a dynamical system is characterized by the rate of local exponential instability which effaces the memory of initial conditions and leads to practical irreversibility. In striking contrast, quantum mechanics appears to exhibit strong memory of the initial state. Here we introduce a notion of complexity for a quantum system and relate it to its stability and reversibility properties. 
0808.03244	Duality between quasi-concave functions and monotone linkage functions	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Yulia Kempner, Vadim E. Levit	Abstract:  A function $F$ defined on all subsets of a finite ground set $E$ is quasi-concave if $F(X\cup Y)\geq\min\{F(X),F(Y)\}$ for all $X,Y\subset E$. Quasi-concave functions arise in many fields of mathematics and computer science such as social choice, theory of graph, data mining, clustering and other fields. The maximization of quasi-concave function takes, in general, exponential time. However, if a quasi-concave function is defined by associated monotone linkage function then it can be optimized by the greedy type algorithm in a polynomial time. Quasi-concave functions defined as minimum values of monotone linkage functions were considered on antimatroids, where the correspondence between quasi-concave and bottleneck functions was shown (Kempner & Levit, 2003). The goal of this paper is to analyze quasi-concave functions on different families of sets and to investigate their relationships with monotone linkage functions. 
0808.03245	Initial correlations in nonequilibrium Falicov-Kimball model	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Minh-Tien Tran	Abstract:  The Keldysh boundary problem in a nonequilibrium Falicov-Kimball model in infinite dimensions is studied within the truncated and self-consistent perturbation theories, and the dynamical mean-field theory. Within the model the system is started in equilibrium, and later a uniform electric field is turned on. The Kadanoff-Baym-Wagner equations for the nonequilibrium Green functions are derived, and numerically solved. The contributions of initial correlations are studied by monitoring the system evolution. It is found that the initial correlations are essential for establishing full electron correlations of the system and independent on the starting time of preparing the system in equilibrium. By examining the contributions of the initial correlations to the electric current and the double occupation, we find that the contributions are small in relation to the total value of those physical quantities when the interaction is weak, and significantly increase when the interaction is strong. The neglect of initial correlations may cause artifacts in the nonequilibrium properties of the system, especially in the strong interaction case. 
0808.03246	Stability and decay-rates for the five-dimensional Schwarzschild metric under biaxial perturbations	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:G. Holzegel	Abstract:  In this paper we prove the non-linear asymptotic stability of the five-dimensional Schwarzschild metric under biaxial vacuum perturbations. This is the statement that the evolution of (SU(2) x U(1))-symmetric vacuum perturbations of initial data for the five-dimensional Schwarzschild metric finally converges in a suitable sense to a member of the Schwarzschild family. It constitutes the first result proving the existence of non-stationary vacuum black holes arising from asymptotically flat initial data dynamically approaching a stationary solution. In fact, we show quantitative rates of approach. The proof relies on vectorfield multiplier estimates, which are used in conjunction with a bootstrap argument to establish polynomial decay rates for the radiation on the perturbed spacetime. Despite being applied here in a five-dimensional context, the techniques are quite robust and may admit applications to various four-dimensional stability problems. 
0808.03247	Maximal Inequalities in Bilateral Grand Lebesque Spaces Over Unbounded Measure	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:E. Ostrovsky, E. Rogover	Abstract:  In this paper non-asymptotic exact rearrangement invariant norm estimates are derived for the maximum distribution of the family elements of some rearrangement invariant (r.i.) space over unbounded measure in the entropy terms and in the terms of generic chaining. We consider some applications in the martingale theory and in the theory of Fourier series. 
0808.03248	Support of Borelian Measures in Separable Banach Spaces	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:E. Ostrovsky	Abstract:  We prove in this article that every Borelian measure, for example, the distribution of a random variable, in separable Banach space has a support which is compact embedded Banach subspace; and prove that if the norm of the random variable belongs to some exponential Orlicz space, then the new subspace can be choose such that the norm of this variable in the new space also belongs to other exponential Orlicz space. 
0808.03249	Differentiability of Lipschitz maps from metric measure spaces to Banach spaces with the Radon Nikodym property	Metric Geometry (math.MG)	Authors:Jeff Cheeger, Bruce Kleiner	Abstract:  We prove the differentiability of Lipschitz maps X-->V, where X is a complete metric measure space satisfying a doubling condition and a Poincaré inequality, and V is a Banach space with the Radon Nikodym Property (RNP). The proof depends on a new characterization of the differentiable structure on such metric measure spaces, in terms of directional derivatives in the direction of tangent vectors to suitable rectifiable curves. 
0808.03250	Effective Hamiltonian of Three-orbital Hubbard Model on Pyrochlore Lattice: Application to LiV_2O_4	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Kazumasa Hattori, Hirokazu Tsunetsugu	Abstract:  We investigate heavy fermion behaviors in the vanadium spinel LiV_2O_4. We start from a three-orbital Hubbard model on the pyrochlore lattice and derive its low-energy effective Hamiltonian by an approach of real-space renormalization group type. One important tetrahedron configuration in the rochlore lattice has a three-fold orbital degeneracy and spin S=1, and correspondingly, the effective Hamiltonian has spin and orbital exchange interactions of Kugel-Khomskii type as well as correlated electron hoppings. Analyzing the effective Hamiltonian, we find that ferromagnetic double exchange processes compete with antiferromagnetic superexchange processes and various spin and orbital exchange processes are competing to each other. These results suggest the absence of phase transition in spin and orbital spaces down to very low temperatures and their large fluctuations in the low-energy sector, which are key issues for understanding the heavy fermion behavior in LiV_2O_4. 
0808.03251	Observation of Quantum Capacitance of individual single walled carbon nanotubes	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Junfeng Dai, Jun Li, Hualing Zeng, Xiaodong Cui	Abstract:  We report a measurement on quantum capacitance of individual semiconducting and small band gap SWNTs. The observed quantum capacitance is remarkably smaller than that originating from density of states and it implies a strong electron correlation in SWNTs. 
0808.03252	Asymptotical behavior of one class of $p$-adic singular Fourier integrals	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:A. Yu. Khrennikov, V. M.Shelkovich	Abstract:  We study the asymptotical behavior of the $p$-adic singular Fourier integrals $$ J_{π_α,m;φ}(t) =\bigl< f_{π_α;m}(x)χ_p(xt), φ(x)\bigr> =F\big[f_{π_α;m}φ\big](t), \quad |t|_p \to \infty, \quad t\in \bQ_p, $$ where $f_{π_α;m}\in {\cD}'(\bQ_p)$ is a {\em quasi associated homogeneous} distribution (generalized function) of degree $π_α(x)=|x|_p^{α-1}π_1(x)$ and order $m$, $π_α(x)$, $π_1(x)$, and $χ_p(x)$ are a multiplicative, a normed multiplicative, and an additive characters of the field $\bQ_p$ of $p$-adic numbers, respectively, $φ\in {\cD}(\bQ_p)$ is a test function, $m=0,1,2...$, $α\in \bC$. If $Reα>0$ the constructed asymptotics constitute a $p$-adic version of the well known Erdélyi lemma. Theorems which give asymptotic expansions of singular Fourier integrals are the Abelian type theorems. In contrast to the real case, all constructed asymptotics have the {\it stabilization} property. 
0808.03253	Champs algébriques et foncteur de Picard	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Sylvain Brochard	Abstract:  This text is my thesis, defended in June 2007, in the status it was at this time. The most important results are contained in the article "Foncteur de Picard d'un champ algébrique" to appear in "Mathematische Annalen" (see the preprint arXiv:0711.4545). In the article, some results have been added, and some previous results have been strengthened. However, the proofs of the results contained in the appendix (concerning the smooth-étale cohomology on an algebraic stack) have been removed. The thesis is only put on the ArXiv to provide a more lasting reference than my webpage for these proofs. 
0808.03254	Effect of Co doping on superconductivity and transport properties in SmFe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$AsO	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Y. K. Li, X. Lin, Z. W. Zhu, H. Chen, C. Wang, L. J. Li, Y. K. Luo, M. He, Q. Tao, H. Y. Li, G. H. Cao, Z. A. Xu	Abstract:  We investigate superconductivity and transport properties of Co doped SmFe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$AsO system. The antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-density wave (SDW) order is rapidly suppressed by Co doping, and superconductivity emerges as $x$ $\geq$ 0.05. $T_c$$^{mid}$ increases with increasing Co content, shows a maximum of 17.2 K at the optimally doping of $x\sim$ 0.10. A phase diagram is derived based on the transport measurements and a dome-like $T_c$ versus $x$ curve is established. Meanwhile we found that the normal state thermopower might consist of two different contributions. One contribution increases gradually with increasing $x$, and the other contribution is abnormally enhanced in the superconducting window 0.05 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 0.20, and shows a dome-like doping dependence. A close correlation between $T_{c}$ and the abnormally enhanced term of thermopower is proposed. 
0808.03255	Impact of Uncertainties in the Cosmological Parameters on the Measurement of Primordial non-Gaussianity	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Liguori, A. Riotto	Abstract:  We study the impact of cosmological parameters' uncertainties on estimates of the primordial NG parameter f_NL in local and equilateral models of non-Gaussianity. We show that propagating these errors increases the f_NL relative uncertainty by 16% for WMAP and 5 % for Planck in the local case, whereas for equilateral configurations the correction term are 14% and 4%, respectively. If we assume for local f_NL a central value of order 60, according to recent WMAP 5-years estimates, we obtain for Planck a final correction Δf_NL = 3. Although not dramatic, this correction is at the level of the expected estimator uncertainty for Planck, and should then be taken into account when quoting the significance of an eventual future detection. In current estimates of f_NL the cosmological parameters are held fixed at their best-fit values. We finally note that the impact of uncertainties in the cosmological parameters on the final f_NL error bar would become totally negligible if the parameters were allowed to vary in the analysis and then marginalized over. 
0808.03256	Heat Transport in low-dimensional systems	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Abhishek Dhar	Abstract:  Recent results on theoretical studies of heat conduction in low-dimensional systems are presented. These studies are on simple, yet nontrivial, models. Most of these are classical systems, but some quantum-mechanical work is also reported. Much of the work has been on lattice models corresponding to phononic systems, and some on hard particle and hard disc systems. A recently developed approach, using generalized Langevin equations and phonon Green's functions, is explained and several applications to harmonic systems are given. For interacting systems, various analytic approaches based on the Green-Kubo formula are described, and their predictions are compared with the latest results from simulation. These results indicate that for momentum-conserving systems, transport is anomalous in one and two dimensions, and the thermal conductivity kappa, diverges with system size L, as kappa ~ L^alpha. For one dimensional interacting systems there is strong numerical evidence for a universal exponent alpha =1/3, but there is no exact proof for this so far. A brief discussion of some of the experiments on heat conduction in nanowires and nanotubes is also given. 
0808.03257	Role of the N*(1440) resonance in the pp->pnpi+ reaction	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Zhen Ouyang, Ju-Jun Xie, Bing-Song Zou, Hu-Shan Xu	Abstract:  New measurement by CELSIUS-WASA Collaboration on the pp->pn pi+ reaction reveals clear evidence for the presence of the Roper resonance N*(1440) which has been ignored in previous theoretical calculations. In this article, based on an effective Lagrangian approach and available knowledge on the Roper resonance, we investigate the role of the Roper resonance for the pp->pn pi+ reaction. It is found that the contribution from the Roper resonance N*(1440) becomes significant for kinetic energy above 1.1 GeV, consistent with the new experimental observation. The t-channel sigma-meson exchange is dominant for the production of the Roper resonance. 
0808.03258	Ratliff-Rush Filtration, regularity and depth of Higher Associated graded modules: Part II	Commutative Algebra (math.AC)	Authors:Tony J. Puthenpurakal	Abstract:  Let $(A,\m)$ be a Noetherian local ring, let $M$ be a finitely generated \CM $A$-module of dimension $r \geq 2$ and let $I$ be an ideal of definition for $M$. Set $L^I(M) = \bigoplus_{n\geq 0}M/I^{n+1}M$. In part one of this paper we showed that $L^I(M)$ is a module over $\R$, the Rees algebra of $I$ and we gave many applications of $L^I(M)$ to study the associated graded module, $G_I(M)$. In this paper we give many further applications of our technique; most notable is a reformulation of a classical result due to Narita in terms of the Ratliff-Rush filtration. This reformulation can be extended to all dimensions $\geq 2$. 
0808.03259	Positivity of relative canonical bundles for families of canonically polarized manifolds	Complex Variables (math.CV)	Authors:Georg Schumacher	Abstract:  Given an effectively parameterized family of canonically polarized manifolds the Kaehler-Einstein metrics on the fibers induce a hermitian metric on the relative canonical bundle. We use a global elliptic equation to show that this metric is strictly positive. For degenerating families we obtain a singular hermitian metric. Main application is an analytic proof of the quasi-projectivity of the moduli space of canonically polarized manifolds. Further applications in arXiv:1002.4858v2. 
0808.03260	Coupled vortex equations and Moduli: Deformation theoretic Approach and Kaehler Geometry	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Indranil Biswas, Georg Schumacher	Abstract:  We investigate differential geometric aspects of moduli spaces parametrizing solutions of coupled vortex equations over a compact Kaehler manifold X. These solutions are known to be related to polystable triples via a Kobayashi-Hitchin type correspondence. Using a characterization of infinitesimal deformations in terms of the cohomology of a certain elliptic double complex, we construct a Hermitian structure on these moduli spaces. This Hermitian structure is proved to be Kaehler. The proof involves establishing a fiber integral formula for the Hermitian form. We compute the curvature tensor of this Kaehler form. When X is a Riemann surface, the holomorphic bisectional curvature turns out to be semi--positive. It is shown that in the case where X is a smooth complex projective variety, the Kaehler form is the Chern form of a Quillen metric on a certain determinant line bundle. 
0808.03261	Exchange energy and stability diagram of few-electron coupled elongated quantum dots	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:L.-X. Zhang, D. V. Melnikov, J.-P. Leburton	Abstract:  We study the properties of a few-electron system confined in coupled elongated quantum dots (QDs) using a model Gaussian potential and the numerical exact diagonalization technique. In the absence of magnetic fields, as the aspect ratio $r$ between the QD extensions in the direction perpendicular and parallel to the coupling directions increases, the exchange energy exhibits a sharp variation at the specific value $r=3.9$, before (after) which the exchange energy increases (declines). The sharp variation occurs because of a sudden change in the single-particle configuration of the triplet state. The stability region with one electron in each of the QDs is found to shrink, and finally vanishes as it becomes progressively easier to localize both electrons into the lower QD. For $r>3.9$, the first singlet-triplet transition shifts to a small magnetic fields. 
0808.03262	On behavior of solvable ideals of Lie algebras under outer derivations	Rings and Algebras (math.RA)	Authors:Anatoliy P. Petravchuk	Abstract:  Let $L$ be a finite dimensional Lie algebra over a field $F$. It is well known that the solvable radical $S(L)$ of the algebra $L$ is a characteristic ideal of $L$ if $\char F=0$ and there are counterexamples to this statement in case $\char F=p>0$. We prove that the sum $S(L)$ of all solvable ideals of a Lie algebra $L$ (not necessarily finite dimensional) is a characteristic ideal of $L$ in the following cases: 1) $\char F=0;$ 2) $S(L)$ is solvable and its derived length is less than $\log_{2}p.$ Some estimations (in characteristic 0) for the derived length of ideals $I+D(I)+... +D^{k}(I)$ are obtained where $I$ is a solvable ideal of $L$ and $D\in Der(L).$ 
0808.03263	Proof of a dynamical Bogomolov conjecture for lines under polynomial actions	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Dragos Ghioca, Thomas J. Tucker	Abstract:  We prove a dynamical version of the Bogomolov conjecture in the special case of lines in affine space A^m under the action of a map (f_1,...,f_m) where each f_i is a polynomial in Q-bar[X] of the same degree. 
0808.03264	K to pi and K to 0 in 2+1 Flavor Partially Quenched Chiral Perturbation Theory	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:C. Aubin, J. Laiho, S. Li, M.F. Lin	Abstract:  We calculate results for K to pi and K to 0 matrix elements to next-to-leading order in 2+1 flavor partially quenched chiral perturbation theory. Results are presented for both the Delta I=1/2 and 3/2 channels, for chiral operators corresponding to current-current, gluonic penguin, and electroweak penguin 4-quark operators. These formulas are useful for studying the chiral behavior of currently available 2+1 flavor lattice QCD results, from which the low energy constants of the chiral effective theory can be determined. The low energy constants of these matrix elements are necessary for an understanding of the Delta I=1/2 rule, and for calculations of epsilon'/epsilon using current lattice QCD simulations. 
0808.03265	A generalized Hirzebruch Riemann-Roch theorem	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Ajay C. Ramadoss	Abstract:  This short note proves a generalization of the Hirzebruch Riemann-Roch theorem equivalent to the Cardy condition described in [1]. This is done using an earlier result [4] that explicitly describes what the Mukai pairing in [1] descends to in Hodge cohomology via the Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg map twisted by the root Todd genus. 
0808.03266	The dynamical Mordell-Lang problem for etale maps	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Jason Bell, Dragos Ghioca, Thomas J. Tucker	Abstract:  We prove a dynamical version of the Mordell-Lang conjecture for etale endomorphisms of quasiprojective varieties. We use p-adic methods inspired by the work of Skolem, Mahler, and Lech, combined with methods from algebraic geometry. As special cases of our result we obtain a new proof of the classical Mordell-Lang conjecture for cyclic subgroups of a semiabelian variety, and we also answer positively a question of Keeler/Rogalski/Stafford for critically dense sequences of closed points of a Noetherian integral scheme. 
0808.03267	Homological interpretation of extensions and biextensions of 1-motives	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Cristiana Bertolin	Abstract:  Let k be a separably closed field. Let K_i=[A_i \to B_i] (for i=1,2,3) be three 1-motives defined over k. We define the geometrical notions of extension of K_1 by K_3 and of biextension of (K_1,K_2) by K_3. We then compute the homological interpretation of these new geometrical notions: namely, the group Biext^0(K_1,K_2;K_3) of automorphisms of any biextension of (K_1,K_2) by K_3 is canonically isomorphic to the cohomology group Ext^0(K_1 \otimes K_2,K_3), and the group Biext^1(K_1,K_2;K_3) of isomorphism classes of biextensions of (K_1,K_2) by K_3 is canonically isomorphic to the cohomology group Ext^1(K_1 \otimes K_2,K_3). 
0808.03268	Minimal Energy Transfer of Solid Material Between Planetary Systems	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Edward Belbruno, Amaya Moro-Martin, Renu Malhotra	Abstract:  The exchange of meteorites among the terrestrial planets of our Solar System is a well established phenomenon that has triggered discussion of lithopanspermia within the Solar System. Similarly, could solid material be transferred across planetary systems? To address this question, we explore the dynamics of the transfer of small bodies between planetary systems. In particular, we examine a dynamical process that yields very low escape velocities using nearly parabolic trajectories, and the reverse process that allows for low velocity capture. These processes are chaotic and provide a mechanism for minimal energy transfer that yield an increased transfer probability compared to that of previously studied mechanisms that have invoked hyperbolic trajectories. We estimate the transfer probability in a stellar cluster as a function of stellar mass and cluster size. We find that significant amounts of solid material could potentially have been transferred from the early Solar System to our nearest neighbor stars. While this low velocity mechanism improves the odds for interstellar lithopanspermia, the exchange of biologically active materials across stellar systems depends greatly upon the highly uncertain viability of organisms over the timescales for transfer, typically millions of years. 
0808.03269	Dynamic scaling approach to study time series fluctuations	Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)	Authors:Alexander S. Balankin	Abstract:  We propose a new approach for properly analyzing stochastic time series by mapping the dynamics of time series fluctuations onto a suitable nonequilibrium surface-growth problem. In this framework, the fluctuation sampling time interval plays the role of time variable, whereas the physical time is treated as the analog of spatial variable. In this way we found that the fluctuations of many real-world time series satisfy the analog of the Family-Viscek dynamic scaling ansatz. This finding permits to use the powerful tools of kinetic roughening theory to classify, model, and forecast the fluctuations of real-world time series. 
0808.03270	Experimental entanglement distillation using Schmidt projection on multiple qubits	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Taehyun Kim, Franco N. C. Wong	Abstract:  Entanglement distillation is a procedure for extracting from one or more pairs of entangled qubits a smaller number of pairs with a higher degree of entanglement that is essential for many applications in quantum information science. Schmidt projection is a unique distillation method that can be applied to more than two pairs of entangled qubits at the same time with high efficiency. We implement the Schmidt projection protocol by applying single-photon two-qubit quantum logic to a partially hyperentangled four-qubit input state. The basic elements of the procedure are characterized and we confirm that the output of Schmidt projection is always maximally entangled independent of the input entanglement quality and that the measured distillation efficiency agrees with theoretical predictions. We show that our implementation strategy can be applied to other quantum systems such as trapped atoms and trapped ions. 
0808.03271	Reply to Comment on "Failure of the work-Hamiltonian connection for free-energy calculations" by Horowitz and Jarzynski	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:J.M.G. Vilar, J.M. Rubi	Abstract:  We show that the Comment [arXiv:0808.1224] by Horowitz and Jarzynski obtains as a main result a general free energy change for a harmonic system that in the macroscopic limit does not recover the textbook expression for the energy change of a Hookean spring. The reason is that Horowitz and Jarzynski improperly identify work with parametric changes of the Hamiltonian instead of with the standard quantity, force times displacement.

Rubi	Abstract:  We show that Peliti's Comment [arXiv:0808.2855] fails to appreciate basic physical principles and consequently misrepresents both our work as well as the classical work of Gibbs and Tolman. 
0808.03273	Entropic rigidity of a crumpling network in a randomly folded thin sheet	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Alexander S. Balankin, Orlando Susarrey Huerta	Abstract:  We have studied experimentally and theoretically the response of randomly folded hyperelastic and elastoplastic sheets on the uniaxial compression loading and the statistical properties of crumpling networks. The results of these studies reveal that the mechanical behavior of randomly folded sheets in the one-dimensional stress state is governed by the shape dependence of the crumpling network entropy. Following up on the original ideas by Edwards for granular materials, we derive an explicit force-compression relationship which precisely fits the experimental data for randomly folded matter. Experimental data also indicate that the entropic rigidity modulus scales as the power of the mass density of the folded ball with universal scaling exponent. 
0808.03274	Cosmological Consequences of Topological Defects: Dark Energy and Varying Fundamental Constants	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:J. Menezes	Abstract:  We investigated domain wall networks as a possible candidate to explain the present accelerated expansion of the universe. We discuss various requirements that any stable lattice of frustrated walls must obey and propose a class of `ideal' model (in terms of its potential to lead to network frustration). By using the results of the largest and most accurate three-dimensional field theory simulations of domain wall networks with junctions, we find compelling evidence for a gradual approach to scaling. We conjecture that, even though one can build (by hand) lattices that would be stable, no such lattices will ever come out of realistic domain wall forming cosmological phase transitions. We consider cosmic strings and magnetic monopoles in Bekenstein-type models and show that there is a class of models of this type for which the classical Nielsen-Olesen vortex and 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles are still valid solutions. We show that Equivalence Principle constraints impose tight limits on the allowed variations of $α$ induced by string networks on cosmological scales. We show that the results obtained using the spherical infall model for an infinite wavelength inhomogeneity are inconsistent with the results of a local linearized gravity study and we argue in favor of the second approach. We also criticize the claim that the value of $α$ inside collapsed regions could be significantly different from the background one on the basis of these findings. 
0808.03275	Power law scaling of lateral deformations with universal Poissons index for randomly folded thin sheets	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Alexander S. Balankin, Didier Samayoa Ochoa, Ernesto Pineda Leon, Rolando Cortes Montes de Oca, Antonio Horta Rangel, Miguel Angel Martinez Cruz	Abstract:  We study the lateral deformations of randomly folded elastoplastic and predominantly plastic thin sheets under the uniaxial and radial compressions. We found that the lateral deformations of cylinders folded from elastoplastic sheets of paper obey a power law behavior with the universal Poissons index nu = 0.17 pm 0.01, which does not depend neither the paper kind and sheet sizes, nor the folding confinement ratio. In contrast to this, the lateral deformations of randomly folded predominantly plastic aluminum foils display the linear dependence on the axial compression with the universal Poissons ratio nu_e = 0.33 pm 0.01. This difference is consistent with the difference in fractal topology of randomly folded elastoplastic and predominantly plastic sheets, which is found to belong to different universality classes. The general form of constitutive stress-deformation relations for randomly folded elastoplastic sheets is suggested. 
0808.03276	Acoustic metafluids	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Andrew N. Norris	Abstract:  Acoustic metafluids are defined as the class of fluids that allow one domain of fluid to acoustically mimic another, as exemplified by acoustic cloaks. It is shown that the most general class of acoustic metafluids are materials with anisotropic inertia and the elastic properties of what are known as pentamode materials. The derivation uses the notion of finite deformation to define the transformation of one region to another. The main result is found by considering energy density in the original and transformed regions. Properties of acoustic metafluids are discussed, and general conditions are found which ensure that the mapped fluid has isotropic inertia, which potentially opens up the possibility of achieving broadband cloaking. 
0808.03277	Spontaneous Broken Local Conformal Symmetry and Dark Energy Candidate	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Lu-Xin Liu	Abstract:  The local conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the Local Lorentz invariance symmetry through the approach of nonlinear realization. The resulting effective Lagrangian, in the unitary gauge, describes a cosmological vector field non-minimally coupling to the gravitational field. As a result of the Higgs mechanism, the vector field absorbs the dilaton and becomes massive, but with an independent energy scale. The Proca type vector field can be modelled as dark energy candidate. The possibility that it further triggers Lorentz symmetry violation is also pointed out.

Describing the ball as an inextensible but flexible membrane containing compressed air, I formulate an approximate theory of the generation of these sounds and predict their amplitudes and waveforms. 
0808.03279	Measurement of the decay of Fock states in a superconducting quantum circuit	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:H. Wang, M. Hofheinz, M. Ansmann, R. C. Bialczak, E. Lucero, M. Neeley, A. D. O'Connell, D. Sank, J. Wenner, A. N. Cleland, John M. Martinis	Abstract:  We demonstrate the controlled generation of Fock states with up to 15 photons in a microwave coplanar waveguide resonator coupled to a superconducting phase qubit. The subsequent decay of the Fock states, due to dissipation, is then monitored by varying the time delay between preparing the state and performing a number-state analysis. We find that the decay dynamics can be described by a master equation where the lifetime of the n-photon Fock state scales as 1/n, in agreement with theory. We have also generated a coherent state in the microwave resonator, and monitored its decay process. We demonstrate that the coherent state maintains a Poisson distribution as it decays, with an average photon number that decreases with the same characteristic decay time as the one-photon Fock state. 
0808.03280	Photon blockade and nonlinear effects for a quantum dot strongly coupled to a semiconductor microcavity	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:F. Bello, D.M. Whittaker	Abstract:  Our model comprehensively simulates modern nanoscale semiconductor microcavities incorporating cavity quantum electrodynamics within both the weak and strong coupling regimes, using on-resonant laser excitation and nonresonant excitation due to a wetting layer. For weak coupling, the most significant effect is photon antibunching with nonresonant emission. We investigate how the antibunching characteristics change as the cavity finesse is increased towards the strong coupling regime. Antibunching can also be observed in a strongly coupled system with resonant excitation, using the photon blockade mechanism which has been demonstrated in atom systems. We calculate what cavity parameters are required to observe this effect. Experimentally these studies are equivalent to nonlinear pump probe measurements, where a strong pump, either resonant or nonresonant, is used to excite the coupled system, and the resulting state is characterized using a weak, resonant probe beam. 
0808.03281	On the diagonalization of the discrete Fourier transform	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Shamgar Gurevich (UC Berkeley), Ronny Hadani (University of Chicago)    	Abstract:  The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is an important operator which acts on the Hilbert space of complex valued functions on the ring Z/NZ. In the case where N=p is an odd prime number, we exhibit a canonical basis of eigenvectors for the DFT. The transition matrix from the standard basis to the canonical basis defines a novel transform which we call the discrete oscillator transform (DOT for short). Finally, we describe a fast algorithm for computing the discrete oscillator transform in certain cases. 
0808.03282	Most Population III Supernovae are Duds	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Robert L. Kurucz	Abstract:  One Population III dud supernova produces enough oxygen to enable ten million solar masses of primordial gas to bind into M dwarfs. This is possible because radiation from other Population III stars implodes the mixture of oxygen ejecta and primordial gas into a globular cluster. Model atmosphere calculations for oxygen dwarfs show that water blocks most of the infrared flux. The flux is redistributed into the visible to produce an unfamiliar, distinctive energy distribution. One million dud supernovae in a large protogalaxy are sufficient to produce the "dark matter" halo. 
0808.03283	Evidence for Correlations Between Nuclear Decay Rates and Earth-Sun Distance	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jere H. Jenkins, Ephraim Fischbach, John B. Buncher, John T. Gruenwald, Dennis E. Krause, Joshua J. Mattes	Abstract:  Unexplained periodic fluctuations in the decay rates of Si-32 and Ra-226 have been reported by groups at Brookhaven National Laboratory (Si-32), and at the Physikalisch-Technische-Bundesandstalt in Germany (Ra-226). We show from an analysis of the raw data in these experiments that the observed fluctuations are strongly correlated in time, not only with each other, but also with the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Some implications of these results are also discussed, including the suggestion that discrepancies in published half-life determinations for these and other nuclides may be attributable in part to differences in solar activity during the course of the various experiments, or to seasonal variations in fundamental constants. 
0808.03284	Clustered and Triggered Star Formation in W5: Observations with Spitzer	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Xavier P. Koenig, Lori E. Allen, Robert A. Gutermuth, Joseph L. Hora, Christopher M. Brunt, James Muzerolle	Abstract:  We present images and initial results from our extensive Spitzer Space Telescope imaging survey of the W5 H II region with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) and Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS). We detect dense clusters of stars, centered on the O stars: HD 18326, BD +60 586, HD 17505 and HD 17520. At 24 microns substantial extended emission is visible, presumably from heated dust grains that survive in the strongly ionizing environment of the H {\sc ii} region. With photometry of more than 18000 point sources, we analyze the clustering properties of objects classified as young stars by their IR spectral energy distributions (a total of 2064 sources) across the region using a minimal-spanning-tree algorithm. We find ~40--70% of infrared excess sources belong to clusters with >10 members. We find that within the evacuated cavities of the H II regions that make up W5, the ratio of Class II to Class I sources is ~7 times higher than for objects coincident with molecular gas as traced by 12CO emission and near-IR extinction maps. We attribute this contrast to an age difference between the two locations, and postulate that at least two distinct generations of star formation are visible across W5. Our preliminary analysis shows that triggering is a plausible mechanism to explain the multiple generations of star formation in W5, and merits further investigation. 
0808.03285	Stellar Populations in the Andromeda V Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Conor Mancone, Ata Sarajedini	Abstract:  Using archival imaging from the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 aboard the Hubble Space Telescope, we investigate the stellar populations of the Local Group dwarf spheroidal Andromeda V - a companion satellite galaxy of M31. The color-magnitude diagram (CMD) extends from above the first ascent red giant branch (RGB) tip to approximately one magnitude below the horizontal branch (HB). The steep well-defined RGB is indicative of a metal-poor system while the HB is populated predominantly redward of the RR Lyrae instability strip. Utilizing Galactic globular cluster fiducial sequences as a reference, we calculate a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -2.20 +/- 0.15 and a distance of (m-M)0 = 24.57 +/- 0.04 after adopting a reddening of E(B-V) = 0.16. This metal abundance places And V squarely in the absolute magnitude - metallicity diagram for dwarf spheroidal galaxies. In addition, if we attribute the entire error-corrected color spread of the RGB stars to an abundance spread, we estimate a range of ~0.5 dex in the metallicities of And V stars. Our analysis of the variable star population of And V reveals the presence of 28 potential variables. Of these, at least 10 are almost certainly RR Lyrae stars based on their time sequence photometry.

An application of this theorem is the complete classification of minimal surfaces of general type with p_{g}=q=1, K^2=8 and nonbirational bicanonical map.

The second part (Sec. 2) is devoted to the mathematical foundation of the large-scale electronic structure theory and their numerical aspects. 
0808.03288	First-order quantum correction to the ground-state energy density of two-dimensional hard-sphere Bose atoms	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Sang-Hoon Kim, Mukunda P. Das	Abstract:  Divergence exponents of the first-order quantum correction of a two-dimensional hard-sphere Bose atoms are obtained by an effective field theory method. The first-order correction to the ground-state energy density with respect to the zeroth-order is given by $\cale_1/\cale_0 \sim |D-2|^{-\al}|\lnγ|^{-\al'}$, where $D$ is the spatial dimension, and $γ$ is the gas parameter ($γ=n a^D$). As $D \to 2$, $\al =\al'=1$. We show that the first-order quantum correction of the energy density is not perturbative in low dimensions of $D < 2.2$ regardless of any gas parameter which is much less that 1. 
0808.03289	Origin of giant photocontraction in obliquely deposited amorphous Ge_xSe_{1-x} thin- films and the intermediate phase	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:Mingji Jin, Ping Chen, P. Boolchand, T. Rajagopalan, K. L. Chopra, K. Starbova, N. Starbov	Abstract:  Obliquely deposited amorphous Ge_xSe{1-x} thin-films at several compositions in the 0.15 < x < 0.333 range, and at several obliqueness angles in the 0 < alpha < 80 range at each x were evaporated on Si and glass substrates. Here alpha designates the angle between film normal and direction of vapor transport. Raman scattering, ir reflectance and optical absorption measurements were undertaken to characterize the vibrational density of states and optical band gaps. Edge views of films in SEM confirm the columnar structure of obliquely (alpha = 80) deposited films. Films, mounted in a cold stage flushed with N2 gas, were irradiated to UV radiation from a Hg-Xe arc lamp, and 
0808.03290	Effects of an oscillating field on magnetic domain patterns: Numerical and theoretical studies on the concentric-ring patterns surrounding a strong defect	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Kazue Kudo	Abstract:  Oscillating fields can make domain patterns change into various types of structures. Numerical simulations show that concentric-ring domain patterns centered at a strong defect are observed under a rapidly oscillating field in some cases. The concentric-ring pattern appears near the threshold of spatially-uniform patterns in high-frequency cases. The threshold is theoretically estimated and the theoretical threshold is in good agreement with numerical one in a high-frequency region. The theoretical analysis gives also good estimations of several characteristics of domain patterns for high-frequencies. 
0808.03291	A note on $l^p$ norms of weighted mean matrices	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Peng Gao	Abstract:  We present some results concerning the $l^p$ norms of weighted mean matrices. These results can be regarded as analogues to a result of Bennett concerning weighted Carleman's inequalities. 
0808.03292	Network Motifs in Object-Oriented Software Systems	Software Engineering (cs.SE)	Authors:Yutao Ma, Keqing He, Jing Liu	Abstract:  Nowadays, software has become a complex piece of work that may be beyond our control. Understanding how software evolves over time plays an important role in controlling software development processes. Recently, a few researchers found the quantitative evidence of structural duplication in software systems or web applications, which is similar to the evolutionary trend found in biological systems. To investigate the principles or rules of software evolution, we introduce the relevant theories and methods of complex networks into structural evolution and change of software systems. According to the results of our experiment on network motifs, we find that the stability of a motif shows positive correlation with its abundance and a motif with high Z score tends to have stable structure. These findings imply that the evolution of software systems is based on functional cloning as well as structural duplication and tends to be structurally stable. So, the work presented in this paper will be useful for the analysis of structural changes of software systems in reverse engineering. 
0808.03293	Quantitative analysis of clumps in the tidal tails of star clusters	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Just, P. Berczik, M. I. Petrov, A. Ernst	Abstract:  Tidal tails of star clusters are not homogeneous but show well defined clumps in observations as well as in numerical simulations. Recently an epicyclic theory for the formation of these clumps was presented. A quantitative analysis was still missing. We present a quantitative derivation of the angular momentum and energy distribution of escaping stars from a star cluster in the tidal field of the Milky Way and derive the connection to the position and width of the clumps. For the numerical realization we use star-by-star $N$-body simulations. We find a very good agreement of theory and models. We show that the radial offset of the tidal arms scales with the tidal radius, which is a function of cluster mass and the rotation curve at the cluster orbit. The mean radial offset is 2.77 times the tidal radius in the outer disc. Near the Galactic centre the circumstances are more complicated, but to lowest order the theory still applies. We have also measured the Jacobi energy distribution of bound stars and showed that there is a large fraction of stars (about 35%) above the critical Jacobi energy at all times, which can potentially leave the cluster. This is a hint that the mass loss is dominated by a self-regulating process of increasing Jacobi energy due to the weakening of the potential well of the star cluster, which is induced by the mass loss itself. 
0808.03294	Radiative MHD simulation of sunspot structure	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Rempel, M. Schuessler, M. Knoelker	Abstract:  Results of a 3D MHD simulation of a sunspot with a photospheric size of about 20 Mm are presented. The simulation has been carried out with the MURaM code, which includes a realistic equation of state with partial ionization and radiative transfer along many ray directions. The largely relaxed state of the sunspot shows a division in a central dark umbral region with bright dots and a penumbra showing bright filaments of about 2 to 3 Mm length with central dark lanes. By a process similar to the formation of umbral dots, the penumbral filaments result from magneto-convection in the form of upflow plumes, which become elongated by the presence of an inclined magnetic field: the upflow is deflected in the outward direction while the magnetic field is weakened and becomes almost horizontal in the upper part of the plume near the level of optical depth unity. A dark lane forms owing to the piling up of matter near the cusp-shaped top of the rising plume that leads to an upward bulging of the surfaces of constant optical depth. The simulated penumbral structure corresponds well to the observationally inferred interlocking-comb structure of the magnetic field with Evershed outflows along dark-laned filaments with nearly horizontal magnetic field and overturning perpendicular (`twisting') motion, which are embedded in a background of stronger and less inclined field. Photospheric spectral lines are formed at the very top and somewhat above the upflow plumes, so that they do not fully sense the strong flow as well as the large field inclination and significant field strength reduction in the upper part of the plume structures. 
0808.03295	A dynamical perspective on additional planets in 55 Cancri	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Sean N. Raymond, Rory Barnes, Noel Gorelick	Abstract:  Five planets are known to orbit the star 55 Cancri. The recently-discovered planet f at 0.78 AU (Fischer et al. 2008) is located at the inner edge of a previously-identified stable zone that separates the three close-in planets from planet d at 5.9 AU. Here we map the stability of the orbital space between planets f and d using a suite of n-body integrations that include an additional, yet-to-be-discovered planet g with a radial velocity amplitude of 5 m/s (planet mass = 0.5-1.2 Saturn masses). We find a large stable zone extending from 0.9 to 3.8 AU at eccentricities below 0.4. For each system we quantify the probability of detecting planets b-f on their current orbits given perturbations from hypothetical planet g, in order to further constrain the mass and orbit of an additional planet. We find that large perturbations are associated with specific mean motion resonances (MMRs) with planets f and d. We show that two MMRs, 3f:1g (the 1:3 MMR between planets g and f) and 4g:1d cannot contain a planet g. The 2f:1g MMR is unlikely to contain a planet more massive than about 20 Earth masses. The 3g:1d and 5g:2d MMRs could contain a resonant planet but the resonant location is strongly confined. The 3f:2g, 2g:1d and 3g:2d MMRs exert a stabilizing influence and could contain a resonant planet. Furthermore, we show that the stable zone may in fact contain 2-3 additional planets, if they are ~50 Earth masses each. Finally, we show that any planets exterior to planet d must reside beyond 10 AU. 
0808.03296	Confirmation Bias and the Open Access Advantage: Some Methodological Suggestions for the Davis Citation Study	Digital Libraries (cs.DL)	Authors:Stevan Harnad	Abstract:  Davis (2008) analyzes citations from 2004-2007 in 11 biomedical journals. 15% of authors paid to make them Open Access (OA). The outcome is a significant OA citation Advantage, but a small one (21%). The author infers that the OA advantage has been shrinking yearly, but the data suggest the opposite. Further analyses are necessary: (1) Not just author-choice (paid) OA but Free OA self-archiving needs to be taken into account rather than being counted as non-OA. (2) proportion of OA articles per journal per year needs to be reported and taken into account. (3) The Journal Impact Factor and the relation between the size of the OA Advantage article 'citation-bracket' need to be taken into account. (4) The sample-size for the highest-impact, largest-sample journal analyzed, PNAS, is restricted and excluded from some of the analyses. The full PNAS dataset is needed. (5) The interaction between OA and time, 2004-2007, is based on retrospective data from a June 2008 total cumulative citation count. The dates of both the cited articles and the citing articles need to be taken into account. The author proposes that author self-selection bias for is the primary cause of the observed OA Advantage, but this study does not test this or of any of the other potential causal factors. The author suggests that paid OA is not worth the cost, per extra citation. But with OA self-archiving both the OA and the extra citations are free. 
0808.03297	Generic short-range interactions in two-leg ladders	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:J. E. Bunder, Hsiu-Hau Lin	Abstract:  We derive a Hamiltonian for a two-leg ladder which includes an arbitrary number of charge and spin interactions. To illustrate this Hamiltonian we consider two examples and use a renormalization group technique to evaluate the ground state phases. The first example is a two-leg ladder with zigzagged legs. We find that increasing the number of interactions in such a two-leg ladder may result in a richer phase diagram, particularly at half-filling where a few exotic phases are possible when the number of interactions are large and the angle of the zigzag is small. In the second example we determine under which conditions a two-leg ladder at quarter-filling is able to support a Tomanaga-Luttinger liquid phase. We show that this is only possible when the spin interactions across the rungs are ferromagnetic. In both examples we focus on lithium purple bronze, a two-leg ladder with zigzagged legs which is though to support a Tomanaga-Luttinger liquid phase. 
0808.03298	On classes of local unitary transformations	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Naihuan Jing	Abstract:  We give a one-to-one correspondence between classes of density matrices under local unitary invariance and the double cosets of unitary groups. We show that the interrelationship among classes of local unitary equivalent multi-partite mixed states is independent from the actual values of the eigenvalues and only depends on the multiplicities of the eigenvalues. The interpretation in terms of homogeneous spaces of unitary groups is also discussed. 
0808.03299	The Dark-Matter Fraction in the Elliptical Galaxy Lensing the Quasar PG1115+080	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:D. Pooley (UW Madison), S. Rappaport, J. Blackburne, P.L. Schechter, J. Schwab (MIT), J. Wambsganss (Heidelberg)    	Abstract:  We determine the most likely dark-matter fraction in the elliptical galaxy quadruply lensing the quasar PG1115+080 based on analyses of the X-ray fluxes of the individual images in 2000 and 2008. Between the two epochs, the A2 image of PG1115+080 brightened relative to the other images by a factor of six in X-rays. We argue that the A2 image had been highly demagnified in 2000 by stellar microlensing in the intervening galaxy and has recently crossed a caustic, thereby creating a new pair of micro-images and brightening in the process. Over the same period, the A2 image has brightened by a factor of only 1.2 in the optical. The most likely ratio of smooth material (dark matter) to clumpy material (stars) in the lensing galaxy to explain the observations is ~90% of the matter in a smooth dark-matter component and ~10% in stars. 
0808.03300	Exploring the limits of single emitter detection in fluorescence and extinction	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Gert Wrigge, Jaesuk Hwang, Ilja Gerhardt, Gert Zumofen, Vahid Sandoghdar	Abstract:  We present an experimental comparison and a theoretical analysis of the signal-to-noise ratios in fluorescence and extinction spectroscopy of a single emitter. We show that extinction measurements can be advantageous if the emitter is weakly excited. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of this method for the detection and spectroscopy of weakly emitting systems such as rare earth ions. 
0808.03301	On homogenization of space-time dependent and degenerate random flows II	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Rémi Rhodes	Abstract:  We study the long time behavior (homogenization) of a diffusion in random medium with time and space dependent coefficients. The diffusion coefficient may degenerate. In Stochastic Process. Appl. (2007) (to appear), an invariance principle is proved for the critical rescaling of the diffusion. Here, we generalize this approach to diffusions whose space-time scaling differs from the critical one. 
0808.03302	Same-sign top pair production in an extra-dimension model of flavor at the CERN Large Hadron Collider	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Jun Gao, Chong Sheng Li, Xiangdong Gao, Zhao Li	Abstract:  We study the same-sign top pair production mediated by the first Kluza-Klein (KK) excitation of the gluon in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with flavor violation at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), in which the nonuniversal couplings between fermions and KK gauge bosons will lead to observable tree level flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) effects. We find that the same-sign top quarks produced in our case have property of high energy and high transverse momentum, and lead to an observable signal in the same-sign dilepton channel even when the mass of the KK gluon reach up to 3 TeV. We further investigate the potential of the LHC to probe the flavor violating parameters and find that the LHC can probe their values down to 0.06. 
0808.03303	Deformation of Lambda hypernuclei	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Myaing Thi Win, K. Hagino	Abstract:  We study the deformation property of $Λ$ hypernuclei using the relativistic mean field (RMF) method. We find that $^{29}_Λ$Si and $^{13}_Λ$C hypernuclei have spherical shape as a consequence of the additional $Λ$ particle, whereas the corresponding core nuclei, $^{28}$Si and $^{12}$C, are oblately deformed. Most of other hypernuclei have a similar deformation parameter to the core nucleus, in accordance with the previous study with the non-relativistic Skyrme-Hartree-Fock method. We discuss the sensitivity of our results to the choice of pairing interaction and to the parameter set of the RMF Lagrangian. 
0808.03304	Siciak-Zahariuta extremal functions, analytic discs and polynomial hulls	Complex Variables (math.CV)	Authors:Finnur Larusson, Ragnar Sigurdsson	Abstract:  We prove two disc formulas for the Siciak-Zahariuta extremal function of an arbitrary open subset of complex affine space. We use these formulas to characterize the polynomial hull of an arbitrary compact subset of complex affine space in terms of analytic discs. Similar results in previous work of ours required the subsets to be connected. 
0808.03305	Formation and Properties of Molecular Cloud Cores	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Sami Dib (1,2), Roberto Galvan-Madrid (3,4), Jongsoo Kim (5), Enrique Vazquez-Semadeni (4) ((1) CEA/Saclay, (2) Lebanese U., (3) CfA/Harvard, (4) UNAM/Morelia, (5) KASI)    	Abstract:  In this paper, we review some of the properties of dense molecular cloud cores. The results presented here rely on three-dimensional numerical simulations of isothermal, magnetized, turbulent, and self-gravitating molecular clouds (MCs) in which dense core form as a consequence of the gravo-turbulent fragmentation of the clouds. In particular we discuss issues related to the mass spectrum of the cores, their lifetimes and their virial balance. 
0808.03306	Electromagnetic signatures of thin accretion disks in wormhole geometries	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Tiberiu Harko, Zoltán Kovács, Francisco S. N. Lobo	Abstract:  In this paper, we study the physical properties and characteristics of matter forming thin accretion disks in static and spherically symmetric wormhole spacetimes. In particular, the time averaged energy flux, the disk temperature and the emission spectra of the accretion disks are obtained for these exotic geometries, and are compared with the Schwarzschild solution. It is shown that more energy is emitted from the disk in a wormhole geometry than in the case of the Schwarzschild potential and the conversion efficiency of the accreted mass into radiation is more than a factor of two higher for the wormholes than for static black holes. These effects in the disk radiation are confirmed in the radial profiles of temperature corresponding to the flux distributions, and in the emission spectrum ωL(ω) of the accretion disks. We conclude that specific signatures appear in the electromagnetic spectrum, thus leading to the possibility of distinguishing wormhole geometries by using astrophysical observations of the emission spectra from accretion disks. 
0808.03307	Proving Noninterference by a Fully Complete Translation to the Simply Typed lambda-calculus	Programming Languages (cs.PL)	Authors:Naokata Shikuma, Atsushi Igarashi	Abstract:  Tse and Zdancewic have formalized the notion of noninterference for Abadi et al.'s DCC in terms of logical relations and given a proof of noninterference by reduction to parametricity of System F. Unfortunately, their proof contains errors in a key lemma that their translation from DCC to System F preserves the logical relations defined for both calculi. In fact, we have found a counterexample for it. In this article, instead of DCC, we prove noninterference for sealing calculus, a new variant of DCC, by reduction to the basic lemma of a logical relation for the simply typed lambda-calculus, using a fully complete translation to the simply typed lambda-calculus. Full completeness plays an important role in showing preservation of the two logical relations through the translation. Also, we investigate relationship among sealing calculus, DCC, and an extension of DCC by Tse and Zdancewic and show that the first and the last of the three are equivalent. 
0808.03308	Generalized Second Law of Thermodynamics in Extended Theories of Gravity	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:M. Akbar	Abstract:  By employing the general expression of temperature $T_{h}=|κ|/2π= \frac{1}{2π\tilde{r}_{A}}(1-\frac{\dot{\tilde{r}}_{A}}{2H\tilde{r}_{A}})$ associated with the apparent horizon of a FRW universe and assuming a region of FRW universe enclosed by the apparent horizon as a thermal system in equilibrium, we are able to show that the generalized second law of thermodynamics holds in Gauss-Bonnet gravity and in more general Lovelock gravity. 
0808.03309	Hydrino like states in graphene and Aharonov-Bohm field	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Pulak Ranjan Giri	Abstract:  We study the dynamics of fermions on graphene in presence of Coulomb impurities and Aharonov-Bohm field. Special emphasis is given to the formation of hydrino like states and its lifting of degeneracy due to the presence of AB field. The flux of the AB field can be tuned to make the low angular momentum hydrino states stable against decay. The zero limit physics of the two coupling constants α_G and Φinvolved in the system is discussed. 
0808.03310	Inferring basic parameters of the geodynamo from sequences of polarity reversals	Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)	Authors:Michael Fischer, Gunter Gerbeth, Andre Giesecke, Frank Stefani	Abstract:  The asymmetric time dependence and various statistical properties of polarity reversals of the Earth's magnetic field are utilized to infer some of the most essential parameters of the geodynamo, among them the effective (turbulent) magnetic diffusivity, the degree of supercriticality, and the relative strength of the periodic forcing which is believed to result from the Milankovic cycle of the Earth's orbit eccentricity. A time-stepped spherically symmetric alpha^2-dynamo model is used as the kernel of an inverse problem solver in form of a downhill simplex method which converges to solutions that yield a stunning correspondence with paleomagnetic data. 
0808.03311	Thermal memory: a storage of phononic information	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Lei Wang, Baowen Li	Abstract:  Memory is an indispensable element for computer besides logic gates. In this Letter we report a model of thermal memory. We demonstrate via numerical simulation that thermal (phononic) information stored in the memory can be retained for a long time without being lost and more importantly can be read out without being destroyed. The possibility of experimental realization is also discussed. 
0808.03312	Three- and four-state rock-paper-scissors games with diffusion	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:Matti Peltomaki, Mikko Alava	Abstract:  Cyclic dominance of three species is a commonly occurring interaction dynamics, often denoted the rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game. Such type of interactions is known to promote species coexistence. Here, we generalize recent results of Reichenbach et al. (e.g. Nature 448, 1046 (2007)) of a four-state variant of RPS. We show that spiral formation takes place only without a conservation law for the total density. Nevertheless, in general fast diffusion can destroy species coexistence. We also generalize the four-state model to slightly varying reaction rates. This is shown both analytically and numerically not to change pattern formation, or the effective wave length of the spirals, and therefore does not alter the qualitative properties of the cross-over to extinction. 
0808.03313	Comprehensive Analysis of Neutrinos in SK part II -- L/E Analysis for Single Ring Muon Events I --	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:E. Konishi (1), Y. Minorikawa (2), V.I. Galkin (3), M. Ishiwata (4), I. Nakamura (4), N. Takahashi (1), M. Kato (5), A. Misaki (6) ((1) Hirosaki University, Japan, (2) Kinki University, Japan, (3) Moscow State University, Russia, (4) Saitama University, Japan,(5) Kyowa Interface Science Co., Ltd., Japan,(6) Waseda University, Japan)    	Abstract:  By referring to the procedures developed in the preceeding paper, we re-analyze the L/E distribution for Fully Contained Events resulting from quasi-elatic scattering (QEL) obtained from the Super-Kamiokande Experiment in relation to their assumption that the direction of the incident neutrino coincide with that of the produced leptons. As the result of it, we clarify that they do not measure L_nu/E_nu distribution itself, but L_mu/E_nu distribution, which cannot show the maximum oscillation existed in the original L_nu/E_nu distribution, because L_nu could not be approximated by L_mu due to the backscattering effect and the azimuthal angle effect in QEL. 
0808.03314	On the nature of an ejection event in the jet of 3C111	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Perucho, I. Agudo, J.L. Gomez, M. Kadler, E. Ros, Y.Y. Kovalev	Abstract:  We present a possible scenario for the ejection of a superluminal component in the jet of the Broad Line Radio Galaxy 3C111 in early 1996. VLBI observations at 15 GHz discovered the presence of two jet features on scales smaller than one parsec. The first component evolves downstream, whereas the second one fades out after 1 parsec. We propose the injection of a perturbation of dense material followed by a decrease in the injection rate of material in the jet as a plausible explanation. This scenario is supported by 1D relativistic hydrodynamics and emission simulations. The perturbation is modeled as an increase in the jet density, without modifying the original Lorentz factor in the initial conditions. We show that an increase of the Lorentz factor in the material of the perturbation fails to reproduce the observed evolution of this flare. We are able to estimate the lifetime of the ejection event in 3C111 to be 36\pm7 days. 
0808.03315	Magnetization of a half-quantum vortex in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Shoichi Hoshi, Hiroki Saito	Abstract:  Magnetization dynamics of a half-quantum vortex in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate with a ferromagnetic interaction are investigated by mean-field and Bogoliubov analyses. The transverse magnetization is shown to break the axisymmetry and form threefold domains. This phenomenon originates from the topological structure of the half-quantum vortex and spin conservation. 
0808.03316	Testing spooky action at a distance	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:D. Salart, A. Baas, C. Branciard, N. Gisin, H. Zbinden	Abstract:  In science, one observes correlations and invents theoretical models that describe them. In all sciences, besides quantum physics, all correlations are described by either of two mechanisms. Either a first event influences a second one by sending some information encoded in bosons or molecules or other physical carriers, depending on the particular science. Or the correlated events have some common causes in their common past. Interestingly, quantum physics predicts an entirely different kind of cause for some correlations, named entanglement. This new kind of cause reveals itself, e.g., in correlations that violate Bell inequalities (hence cannot be described by common causes) between space-like separated events (hence cannot be described by classical communication). Einstein branded it as spooky action at a distance. A real spooky action at a distance would require a faster than light influence defined in some hypothetical universally privileged reference frame. Here we put stringent experimental bounds on the speed of all such hypothetical influences. We performed a Bell test during more than 24 hours between two villages separated by 18 km and approximately east-west oriented, with the source located precisely in the middle. We continuously observed 2-photon interferences well above the Bell inequality threshold. Taking advantage of the Earth's rotation, the configuration of our experiment allowed us to determine, for any hypothetically privileged frame, a lower bound for the speed of this spooky influence. For instance, if such a privileged reference frame exists and is such that the Earth's speed in this frame is less than 10^-3 that of the speed of light, then the speed of this spooky influence would have to exceed that of light by at least 4 orders of magnitude. 
0808.03317	A Limit on Non-Locality Distillation	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Dejan D. Dukaric, Stefan Wolf	Abstract:  Non-local correlations are not only a fascinating feature of quantum theory, but an interesting resource for information processing, for instance in communication-complexity theory or cryptography. An important question in this context is whether the resource can be distilled: Given a large amount of weak non-local correlations, is there a method to obtain strong non-locality using local operations and shared randomness? We partly answer this question by no: CHSH-type non-locality, the only possible non-locality of binary systems, which is not super-strong, but achievable by measurements on certain quantum states, has at best very limited distillability by any non-interactive classical method. This strongly extends and generalizes what was previously known, namely that there are two limits that cannot be overstepped: The Bell and Tsirelson bounds. Moreover, our results imply that there must be an infinite number of such bounds. A noticeable feature of our proof of this purely classical statement is that it is quantum mechanical in the sense that (both novel and known) facts from quantum theory are used in a crucial way to obtain the claimed results. One of these results, of independent interest, is that certain mixed entangled states cannot be distilled without communication. Weaker statements, namely limited distillability, have been known for Werner states. 
0808.03318	Broad lifetime distributions for ordering dynamics in complex networks	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:R. Toivonen, X. Castelló, V. M. Eguíluz, J. Saramäki, K. Kaski, M. San Miguel	Abstract:  We search for conditions under which a characteristic time scale for ordering dynamics towards either of two absorbing states in a finite complex network of interactions does not exist. With this aim, we study random networks and networks with mesoscale community structure built up from randomly connected cliques. We find that large heterogeneity at the mesoscale level of the network appears to be a sufficient mechanism for the absence of a characteristic time for the dynamics. Such heterogeneity results in dynamical metastable states that survive at any time scale. 
0808.03319	Antenna functions from MHV rules	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Claude Duhr, Fabio Maltoni	Abstract:  QCD amplitudes display a universal behaviour when one or more partons are soft and/or collinear. This can expressed in terms of antenna functions which are much simpler than the full amplitudes and yet correctly embody their infrared behaviour. We show how antenna functions can be naturally obtained via a twistor-inspired MHV approach. As an application, we present compact results for MHV and NMHV antennas functions valid for any number of gluons. These are sufficient to calculate the complete set of tree-level gluon antenna functions up to NNNLO. As an interesting corollary, we prove that splitting amplitudes too can be written directly through a MHV diagrammatic approach. Finally we find that antenna functions, collinear splitting amplitudes and eikonal factors satisfy the same kind of recursive relation as the full amplitudes. 
0808.03320	Graphene - A rising star in view of scientometrics	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:Andreas Barth, Werner Marx	Abstract:  We have carried out a scientometric analysis of the literature dealing with graphene, a material which has been identified as a new carbon allotrope. The investigation is based on the CAplus database of Chemical Abstracts Service, the INSPEC database of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the Web of Science (WoS) of Thomson Reuters. The time evolution of the publications shows a dramatic increase since 2004 when graphene has been isolated for the first time. The graphene literature has been analyzed with respect to the most productive authors, research organizations, countries of authors, and the leading journals. Furthermore, the time evolution of the major graphene based research topics and the top 10 most productive research organizations with respect to their specific topics have been analyzed and are shown as heat maps. In addition, the graphene research landscape has been established using the analysis tool STN AnaVist. Finally, a brief citation analysis has been performed. The time evolution of the impact reveals that, rather similar to the output evolution, the impact increase of the graphene papers within the starting period is possibly going to outrun the impact increase of the fullerenes and nanotubes papers. 
0808.03321	Supersolids in one dimensional Bose Fermi mixtures	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Frederic Hebert, George G. Batrouni, Xavier Roy, Valery G. Rousseau	Abstract:  Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we study a mixture of bosons and fermions loaded on an optical lattice. With simple on-site repulsive interactions, this system can be driven into a solid phase. We dope this phase and, in analogy with pure bosonic systems, identify the conditions under which the bosons enter a supersolid phase, i.e., exhibiting at the same time charge density wave and superfluid order. We perform finite size scaling analysis to confirm the presence of a supersolid phase and discuss its properties, showing that it is a collective phase that also involve phase coherence of the fermions. 
0808.03322	"Jordan's Scalar Stars" and Dark Matter	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:S.M.Kozyrev	Abstract:  Here we are starting the study of the field equations of relativistic scalar tensor theories in the spherically symmetric gravitational field. In the present article we shall consider as an example only the simplest Jordan-Brans-Dicke (JBD) one. To illustrate the property of the spherically symmetric JBD configuration we exhibit a new representation of the well-known four dimensional solutions. In this model, a suitable segment of Brans solution is chosen for the interior of the object while the outer region consists of a Schwarzschild vacuum. We have constructed "Jordan's scalar stars" model consisting of three parts: a homogeneous inner core with linear equation of state; an envelope of Brans spacetime matching the core and the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. We have also showed that this toy model can explain the intergalactic effects without the dark matter hypothesis. 
0808.03323	Law of Genome Evolution Direction : Coding Information Quantity Grows	Genomics (q-bio.GN)	Authors:Liaofu Luo	Abstract:  The problem of the directionality of genome evolution is studied. Based on the analysis of C-value paradox and the evolution of genome size we propose that the function-coding information quantity of a genome always grows in the course of evolution through sequence duplication, expansion of code, and gene transfer from outside. The function-coding information quantity of a genome consists of two parts, p-coding information quantity which encodes functional protein and n-coding information quantity which encodes other functional elements except amino acid sequence. The evidences on the evolutionary law about the function-coding information quantity are listed. The needs of function is the motive force for the expansion of coding information quantity and the information quantity expansion is the way to make functional innovation and extension for a species. So, the increase of coding information quantity of a genome is a measure of the acquired new function and it determines the directionality of genome evolution. 
0808.03324	On the Weak Measurement of Velocity in Bohmian Mechanics	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Detlef Duerr, Sheldon Goldstein, Nino Zanghi	Abstract:  In a recent article (New Journal of Physics 9, 165, 2007), Wiseman has proposed the use of so-called weak measurements for the determination of the velocity of a quantum particle at a given position, and has shown that according to quantum mechanics the result of such a procedure is the Bohmian velocity of the particle. Although Bohmian mechanics is empirically equivalent to variants based on velocity formulas different from the Bohmian one, and although it has been proven that the velocity in Bohmian mechanics is not measurable, we argue here for the somewhat paradoxical conclusion that Wiseman's weak measurement procedure indeed constitutes a genuine measurement of velocity in Bohmian mechanics. We reconcile the apparent contradictions and elaborate on some of the different senses of measurement at play here. 
0808.03325	Shannon dimensionality of quantum channels and its application to photon entanglement	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:J.B. Pors, S.S.R. Oemrawsingh, A. Aiello, M.P. van Exter, E.R. Eliel, G. W. 't Hooft, J.P. Woerdman	Abstract:  We introduce the concept of Shannon dimensionality D as a new way to quantify bipartite entanglement as measured in an experiment. This is applied to orbital-angular-momentum entanglement of two photons, using two state analyzers composed of a rotatable angular-sector phase plate that is lens-coupled to a single-mode fiber. We can deduce the value of D directly from the observed two-photon coincidence fringe. In our experiment, D varies between 2 and 6, depending on the experimental conditions. We predict how the Shannon dimensionality evolves when the number of angular sectors imprinted in the phase plate is increased and anticipate that D = 50 is experimentally within reach. 
0808.03326	Ergodic actions of compact quantum groups from solutions of the conjugate equations	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Claudia Pinzari, John E. Roberts	Abstract:  We use a tensor C*-category with conjugates and two quasitensor functors into the category of Hilbert spaces to define a *-algebra depending functorially on this data. If one of them is tensorial, we can complete in the maximal C*-norm. A particular case of this construction allows us to begin with solutions of the conjugate equations and associate ergodic actions of quantum groups on the C*-algebra in question. The quantum groups involved are A_u(Q) and B_u(Q). 
0808.03327	The Araucaria Project: The Distance to the Sculptor Group Galaxy NGC 247 from Cepheid Variables Discovered in a Wide-Field	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Garcia-Varela, G. Pietrzynski, W. Gieren, A. Udalski, I. Soszynski, A. Walker, F. Bresolin, R. P. Kudritzki, Szewczyk. O., M. Szymanski, M. Kubiak, L. Wyrzykowski	Abstract:  We report on the discovery of a Cepheid population in the Sculptor Group spiral galaxy NGC 247 for the first time. On the basis of wide-field images collected in photometric surveys in V and I bands which were conducted with three different telescopes and cameras, 23 Cepheid variables were discovered with periods ranging from 17 to 131 days. We have constructed the period-luminosity relations from these data and obtain distance moduli to NGC 247 of 28.20 $\pm$ 0.05 mag (internal error) in V, 28.04 $\pm$ 0.06 mag in I, and 27.80 $\pm$ 0.09 mag in the reddening-independent Wesenheit index. From our optical data we have determined the total mean reddening of the Cepheids in NGC 247 as E(B-V)=0.13 mag, which brings the true distance modulus determinations from the V and I bands into excellent agreement with the distance determination in the Wesenheit index. The best estimate for the true distance modulus of NGC 247 from our optical Cepheid photometry is 27.80 $\pm$0.09 (internal error) $\pm$ 0.09 mag (systematic error) which is in excellent agreement with other recent distance determinations for NGC 247 from the Tip of the Red Giant branch method, and from the Tully-Fisher relation. The distance for NGC 247 places this galaxy at twice the distance of two other Sculptor Group galaxies, NGC 300 and NGC 55, yielding supporting evidence for the filament-like structure of this group of galaxies. The reported distance value is tied to an assumed LMC distance modulus of 18.50 mag. 
0808.03328	Numerical evidence of the spin-chirality decoupling in the three-dimensional Heisenberg spin glass	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:Dao Xuan Viet, Hikaru Kawamura	Abstract:  Ordering of the three-dimensional Heisenberg spin glass with Gaussian coupling is studied by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The model undergoes successive chiral-glass and spin-glass transitions at nonzero temperatures T_{CG} > T_{SG} > 0, exhibiting the spin-chirality decoupling. 
0808.03329	Variational calculations for K-few-nucleon systems	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:S. Wycech, A.M. Green	Abstract:  Deeply bound KNN, KNNN and KNNNN states are discussed. The effective force exerted by the K meson on the nucleons is calculated with static nucleons. Next the binding energies are obtained by solving the Schrodinger equation or by variational calculations. The dominant attraction comes from the S-wave Lambda(1405) and an additional contribution is due to Sigma(1385). The latter state is formed at the nuclear peripheries and absorbs a sizable piece of the binding energy. It also generates new branches of quasi-bound states. The lowest binding energies based on a phenomenological KN input fall into the 40-80 MeV range for KNN, 90-150 MeV for KNNN and 120-220 MeV for K-alpha systems. The uncertainties are due to unknown KN interactions in the distant subthreshold energy region. 
0808.03330	Double constructions of Frobenius algebras, Connes cocycles and their duality	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Chengming Bai	Abstract:  We construct an associative algebra with a decomposition into the direct sum of the underlying vector spaces of another associative algebra and its dual space such that both of them are subalgebras and the natural symmetric bilinear form is invariant or the natural antisymmetric bilinear form is a Connes cocycle. The former is called a double construction of Frobenius algebra and the latter is called a double construction of Connes cocycle which is interpreted in terms of dendriform algebras. Both of them are equivalent to a kind of bialgebras, namely, antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras and dendriform D-bialgebras respectively. In the coboundary cases, our study leads to what we call associative Yang-Baxter equation in an associative algebra and $D$-equation in a dendriform algebra respectively, which are analogues of the classical Yang-Baxter equation in a Lie algebra. We show that an antisymmetric solution of associative Yang-Baxter equation corresponds to the antisymmetric part of a certain operator called ${\mathcal O}$-operator which gives a double construction of Frobenius algebra, whereas a symmetric solution of $D$-equation corresponds to the symmetric part of an ${\mathcal O}$-operator which gives a double construction of Connes cocycle. By comparing antisymmetric infinitesimal bialgebras and dendriform D-bialgebras, we observe that there is a clear analogy between them. Due to the correspondences between certain symmetries and antisymmetries appearing in the analogy, we regard it as a kind of duality. 
0808.03331	Efficient algorithms for the basis of finite Abelian groups	Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)	Authors:Gregory Karagiorgos, Dimitrios Poulakis	Abstract:  Let $G$ be a finite abelian group $G$ with $N$ elements. In this paper we give a O(N) time algorithm for computing a basis of $G$. Furthermore, we obtain an algorithm for computing a basis from a generating system of $G$ with $M$ elements having time complexity $O(M\sum_{p|N} e(p)\lceil p^{1/2}\rceil^{μ(p)})$, where $p$ runs over all the prime divisors of $N$, and $p^{e(p)}$, $μ(p)$ are the exponent and the number of cyclic groups which are direct factors of the $p$-primary component of $G$, respectively. In case where $G$ is a cyclic group having a generating system with $M$ elements, a $O(MN^ε)$ time algorithm for the computation of a basis of $G$ is obtained. 
0808.03332	Josephson tunnel junctions with strong ferromagnetic interlayer	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:A. A. Bannykh, J. Pfeiffer, V. S. Stolyarov, I. E. Batov, V. V. Ryazanov, M. Weides	Abstract:  The dependence of the critical current density j_c on the ferromagnetic interlayer thickness d_F was determined for Nb/Al_2O_3/Cu/Ni/Nb Josephson tunnel junctions with ferromagnetic \Ni interlayer from very thin film thicknesses (\sim 1 nm) upwards and classified into F-layer thickness regimes showing a dead magnetic layer, exchange, exchange + anisotropy and total suppression of j_c. The Josephson coupling changes from 0 to pi as function of d_F, and -very close to the crossover thickness- as function of temperature. The strong suppression of the supercurrent in comparison to non-magnetic \Nb/Al_2O_3/Cu/Nb junctions indicated that the insertion of a F-layer leads to additional interface scattering. The transport inside the dead magnetic layer was in dirty limit. For the magnetically active regime fitting with both the clean and the dirty limit theory were carried out, indicating dirty limit condition, too. The results were discussed in the framework of literature 
0808.03333	The Bi-Musquash Conjecture	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Jon Henry Sanders	Abstract:  D.R. Woodall's definition of a 'musquash' is extended to that of a 'bi-musquash' and the existence/uniqueness of these is discussed. 
0808.03334	Chromospheric magnetic field and density structure measurements using hard X-rays in a flaring coronal loop	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:E. P. Kontar, I. G. Hannah, A. L. MacKinnon	Abstract:  A novel method of using hard X-rays as a diagnostic for chromospheric density and magnetic structures is developed to infer sub-arcsecond vertical variation of magnetic flux tube size and neutral gas density.Using Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) X-ray data and the newly developed X-ray visibilities forward fitting technique we find the FWHM and centroid positions of hard X-ray sources with sub-arcsecond resolution ($\sim 0.2"$) for a solar limb flare. We show that the height variations of the chromospheric density and the magnetic flux densities can be found with unprecedented vertical resolution of $\sim$ 150 km by mapping 18-250 keV X-ray emission of energetic electrons propagating in the loop at chromospheric heights of 400-1500 km. Our observations suggest that the density of the neutral gas is in good agreement with hydrostatic models with a scale height of around $140\pm 30$ km. FWHM sizes of the X-ray sources decrease with energy suggesting the expansion (fanning out) of magnetic flux tube in the chromosphere with height. The magnetic scale height $B(z)(dB/dz)^{-1}$ is found to be of the order of 300 km and strong horizontal magnetic field is associated with noticeable flux tube expansion at a height of $\sim$ 900 km. 
0808.03335	Dynamic origin of azimuthal modes splitting in vortex-state magnetic dots	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Konstantin Y. Guslienko, Andrei N. Slavin, Vasyl Tiberkevich, Sang-Koog Kim	Abstract:  A spin wave theory explaining experimentally observed frequency splitting of dynamical excitations with azimuthal symmetry of a magnetic dot in a vortex ground state is developed. It is shown that this splitting is a result of the dipolar hybridization of three spin wave modes of a dot having azimuthal indices |m|=1: two high-frequency azimuthal excitation modes of the in-plane part of the vortex with indices m = +/-1 and a low-frequency m= +1 gyrotropic mode describing the translational motion of the vortex core. The analytically calculated magnitude of the frequency splitting is proportional to the ratio of the dot thickness to its radius and quantitatively agrees with the results of time resolved Kerr experiments. 
0808.03336	The HST/ACS Atlas of Protoplanetary Disks in the Great Orion Nebula	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Luca Ricci, Massimo Robberto, David R. Soderblom	Abstract:  We present the atlas of protoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula based on the ACS/WFC images obtained for the HST Treasury Program on the Orion Nebula Cluster. The observations have been carried out in 5 photometric filters nearly equivalent to the standard B, V, Halpha, I, and z passbands. Our master catalog lists 178 externally ionized proto-planetary disks (proplyds), 28 disks seen only in absorption against the bright nebular background (silhouette disks), 8 disks seen only as dark lanes at the midplane of extended polar emission (bipolar nebulae or reflection nebulae) and 5 sources showing jet emission with no evidence of neither external ionized gas emission nor dark silhouette disks. Many of these disks are associated with jets seen in Halpha and circumstellar material detected through reflection emission in our broad-band filters; approximately 2/3 have identified counterparts in x-rays. A total of 47 objects (29 proplyds, 7 silhouette disks, 6 bipolar nebulae, 5 jets with no evidence of proplyd emission or silhouette disk) are new detections with HST. We include in our list 4 objects previously reported as circumstellar disks which have not been detected in our HST/ACS images either because they are hidden by the bleeding trails of a nearby saturated bright star or because of their location out of the HST/ACS Treasury Program field. Other 31 sources previously reported as extended objects do not harbor a stellar source in our HST/ACS images. We also report on the detection of 16 red, elongated sources. Their location at the edges of the field, far from the Trapezium Cluster core (> 10'), suggests that these are probably background galaxies observed through low extinction regions of the Orion Molecular Cloud OMC-1. 
0808.03337	Quantum equation of motion for a particle in the field of primordial fluctuations	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:S.N. Andrianov, V.V. Bochkarev, S.M. Kozyrev	Abstract:  Brane model of universe is considered for a particle. Conservation laws inside the brane are obtained. Equation of motion is derived for a particle using variation principle from these conservation laws. This equation includes terms accounting the variation of brane topology. Its solution is obtained at some approximations and dispersion relation for a particle is derived. 
0808.03338	Non-Haar $p$-adic wavelets and their application to pseudo-differential operators and equations	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:A. Yu. Khrennikov, V. M. Shelkovich	Abstract:  In this paper a countable family of new compactly supported {\em non-Haar} $p$-adic wavelet bases in ${\cL}^2(\bQ_p^n)$ is constructed. We use the wavelet bases in the following applications: in the theory of $p$-adic pseudo-differential operators and equations. Namely, we study the connections between wavelet analysis and spectral analysis of $p$-adic pseudo-differential operators. A criterion for a multidimensional $p$-adic wavelet to be an eigenfunction for a pseudo-differential operator is derived. We prove that these wavelets are eigenfunctions of the fractional operator. In addition, $p$-adic wavelets are used to construct solutions of linear and semi-linear pseudo-differential equations. Since many $p$-adic models use pseudo-differential operators (fractional operator), these results can be intensively used in these models. 
0808.03339	Random walker in a temporally deforming higher-order potential forces observed in financial crisis	Statistical Finance (q-fin.ST)	Authors:Kota Watanabe, Hideki Takayasu, Misako Takayasu	Abstract:  Basic peculiarities of market price fluctuations are known to be well described by a recently developed random walk model in a temporally deforming quadric potential force whose center is given by a moving average of past price traces [Physica A 370, pp91-97, 2006]. By analyzing high-frequency financial time series of exceptional events such as bubbles and crashes, we confirm the appearance of nonlinear potential force in the markets. We show statistical significance of its existence by applying the information criterion. This new time series analysis is expected to be applied widely for detecting a non-stationary symptom in random phenomena. 
0808.03340	Radiative seesaw: Warm dark matter, collider and lepton flavour violating signals	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:D. Aristizabal Sierra, Jisuke Kubo, D. Restrepo, Daijiro Suematsu, Oscar Zapata	Abstract:  Extending the standard model with three right-handed neutrinos ($N_k$) and a second Higgs doublet ($η$), odd under the discrete parity symmetry $Z_2$, Majorana neutrino masses can be generated at 1-loop order. In the resulting model, the lightest stable particle, either a boson or a fermion, might be a dark matter candidate. Here we assume a specific mass spectrum ($M_1\ll M_2 < M_3 < m_η$) and derive its consequences for dark matter and collider phenomenology. We show that (i) the lightest right-handed neutrino is a warm dark matter particle that can give a $\sim$10% contribution to the dark matter density; (ii) several decay branching ratios of the charged scalar can be predicted from measured neutrino data. Especially interesting is that large lepton flavour violating rates in muon and tau final states are expected. Finally, we derive upper bounds on the right-handed neutrino Yukawa couplings from the current experimental limit on $Br(μ\to eγ)$. 
0808.03341	Time Dependent Monochromatic Scattering of Radiation in One Dimensional Media: Analytical and Numerical Solutions	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:D.I. Nagirner, S.L. Kirusheva	Abstract:  In order to choose a numerical method for solving the time dependent equations of radiative transport, we obtain an exact solution for the time dependent radiation field in a one dimensional infinite medium with monochromatic, isotropic scattering for sources with an arbitrary spatial distribution and an arbitrary time variation of their power. The Lax-Wendroff method seems to be the most suitable. Because it is assumed that radiation delay is caused by the finite speed of light, the following difficulty arises when the numerical method is used: the region of variation of the variables (dimensionless coordinate τand time t) is triangular (the inequality τ< t). This difficulty is overcome by expanding the unknown functions in series in terms of small values of the time and coordinate. By comparing the numerical and exact solutions for a point source with a given time dependence for its power and with pure scattering, the steps in the variables required to obtain a desired accuracy are estimated. This numerical method can be used to calculate the intensity and polarization of the radiation from sources in the early universe during epochs close to the recombination epoch. 
0808.03342	Thermodynamic Properties of $^{56,57}$Fe	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:E. Algin, U. Agvaanluvsan, M. Guttormsen, A.C. Larsen, G.E. Mitchell, J. Rekstad, A. Schiller, S. Siem, A. Voinov	Abstract:  Nuclear level densities for $^{56,57}$Fe have been extracted from the primary $γ$-ray spectra using ($^3$He,$^3$He$^{\prime}γ$) and ($^3$He,$α γ$) reactions. Nuclear thermodynamic properties for $^{56}$Fe and $^{57}$Fe are investigated using the experimental level densities. These properties include entropy, Helmholtz free energy, caloric curves, chemical potential, and heat capacity. In particular, the breaking of Cooper pairs and single-quasiparticle entropy are discussed and shown to be important concepts for describing nuclear level density. Microscopic model calculations are performed for level densities of $^{56,57}$Fe. The experimental and calculated level densities are compared. The average number of broken Cooper pairs and the parity distribution are extracted as a function of excitation energy for $^{56,57}$Fe from the model calculations. 
0808.03343	Suspended single-electron transistors: fabrication and measurement	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:G. S. Paraoanu, A. M. Halvari	Abstract:  We have fabricated aluminum single-electron transistors in which the island is not in contact with the substrate. This new type of device, which can be called suspended single-electron transistor (SUSET), displayed well-defined I-V and dI/dV-V features typical for high-quality standard SET's. 
0808.03344	Percolation for the Vacant Set of Random Interlacements	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Vladas Sidoravicius, Alain-Sol Sznitman	Abstract:  We investigate random interlacements on Z^d, d bigger or equal to 3. This model recently introduced in arXiv:0704.2560 corresponds to a Poisson cloud on the space of doubly infinite trajectories modulo time-shift tending to infinity at positive and negative infinite times. A non-negative parameter u measures how many trajectories enter the picture. Our main interest lies in the percolative properties of the vacant set left by random interlacements at level u. We show that for all d bigger or equal to 3 the vacant set at level u percolates when u is small. This solves an open problem of arXiv:0704.2560, where this fact has only been established when d is bigger or equal to 7. It also completes the proof of the non-degeneracy in all dimensions d bigger or equal to 3 of the critical parameter introduced in arXiv:0704.2560. 
0808.03345	On integrability of Hirota-Kimura type discretizations. Experimental study of the discrete Clebsch system	Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)	Authors:M. Petrera (U. Roma Tre), A. Pfadler (TU Muenchen), Yu.B. Suris (TU Muenchen)    	Abstract:  R. Hirota and K. Kimura discovered integrable discretizations of the Euler and the Lagrange tops, given by birational maps. Their method is a specialization to the integrable context of a general discretization scheme introduced by W. Kahan and applicable to any vector field with a quadratic dependence on phase variables. According to a proposal by T. Ratiu, discretizations of the Hirota-Kimura type can be considered for numerous integrable systems of classical mechanics. Due to a remarkable and not well understood mechanism, such discretizations seem to inherit the integrability for all algebraically completely integrable systems. We introduce an experimental method for a rigorous study of integrability of such discretizations. Application of this method to the Hirota-Kimura type discretization of the Clebsch system leads to the discovery of four functionally independent integrals of motion of this discrete time system, which turn out to be much more complicated than the integrals of the continuous time system. Further, we prove that every orbit of the discrete time Clebsch system lies in an intersection of four quadrics in the six-dimensional phase space. Analogous results hold for the Hirota-Kimura type discretizations for all commuting flows of the Clebsch system, as well as for the $so(4)$ Euler top. 
0808.03346	Mechanisms of reversible photodegradation in disperse orange 11 dye doped in PMMA polymer	Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)	Authors:Natnael B. Embaye, Shiva K. Ramini, Mark G. Kuzyk	Abstract:  We use amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) and linear absorption spectroscopy to study the mechanisms of reversible photodegradation of 1-amino-2-methylanthraquinone (disperse orange 11-DO11) in solid poly(methyl methacrylate). Measurements as a function of intensity, concentration, and time suggest that ASE originates in a state (be it a tautomer or a vibronic level) that can form a dimer or some other aggregate upon relaxation, which through fluorescence quenching leads to degradation of the ASE signal. Whatever the degradation route, a high concentration of DO11 is required and the polymer plays a key role in the process of opening a new reversible degradation pathway that is not available at lower concentrations or in liquid solutions. We construct an energy level diagram that describes all measured quantities in the decay and recovery processes and propose a hypothesis of the nature of the associated states. 
0808.03347	Heavy Quark Production at the Tevatron	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Sally Seidel	Abstract:  Results are presented from four CDF analyses involving heavy quark production in proton-antiproton collisions at center of mass energy 1.96 TeV. The shapes of b-jets are found to be broader than inclusive predictions and broader than both PYTHIA and HERWIG defaults. A measurement of the production cross section for psi(2S) is consistent with Run 1 results and with theoretical predictions associated with parton distribution function energy dependence. The inclusive b-jet production cross section is also consistent with theoretical predictions over six orders of magnitude. The b-bbar differential production cross section is compared to several theoretical models and found to be best described by MC@NLO + JIMMY. 
0808.03348	Torsional oscillators and the entropy dilemma of putative supersolid He-4	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:M.J. Graf, A.V. Balatsky, Z. Nussinov, I. Grigorenko, S.A. Trugman	Abstract:  Solid He-4 is viewed as a nearly perfect Debye solid. Yet, recent calorimetry measurements by the PSU group (J. Low Temp. Phys. 138, 853 (2005) and Nature 449, 1025 (2007)) indicate that at low temperatures the specific heat has both cubic and linear contributions. These features appear in the same temperature range where measurements of the torsional oscillator period suggest a supersolid transition. We analyze the specific heat and compare the measured with the estimated entropy for a proposed supersolid transition with 1% superfluid fraction and find that the observed entropy is too small. We suggest that the low-temperature linear term in the specific heat is due to a glassy state that develops at low temperatures and is caused by a distribution of tunneling systems in the crystal. We propose that dislocation related defects produce those tunneling systems. Further, we argue that the reported putative mass decoupling, that means an increase in the oscillator frequency, is consistent with a glass-like transition. The glass scenario offers an alternative interpretation of the torsional oscillator experiments in contrast to the supersolid scenario of nonclassical rotational inertia. 
0808.03349	Charm and bottom baryon masses in the combined $1/N_c$ and $1/m_Q$ expansion versus quark model	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:C. Semay, F. Buisseret, F. Stancu	Abstract:  A good agreement between a flux tube-based quark model of light baryons (strange and nonstrange) and the $1/N_c$ expansion mass formula has been found in previous studies. In the present work a larger connection is established between the quark model and the $1/N_c$ and $1/m_Q$ expansion method by extending the previous procedure to baryons made of one heavy and two light quarks. The compatibility between both approaches is shown to hold in this sector too. 
0808.03350	Scaling of solvation force in 2D Ising strip	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:P. Nowakowski, M. Napiórkowski	Abstract:  The solvation force for the 2D Ising strip is calculated via exact diagonalization of the transfer matrix in two cases: the symmetric case corresponds to identical surface fields, and the antisymmetric case to exactly opposite surface fields. In the symmetric case the solvation force is always negative (attractive) while in the antisymmetric case the solvation force is positive (repulsive) at high temperatures and negative at low temperatures. It changes sign close to the critical wetting temperature characterizing the semi--infinite system. The properties of the solvation force are discussed and the scaling function describing its dependence on temperature, surface field, and strip's width is proposed. 
0808.03351	Derived categories of cubic fourfolds	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Alexander Kuznetsov	Abstract:  We discuss the structure of the derived category of coherent sheaves on cubic fourfolds of three types: Pfaffian cubics, cubics containing a plane and singular cubics, and discuss its relation to the rationality of these cubics. 
0808.03352	A stochastic model for tumor growth with immunization	Cell Behavior (q-bio.CB)	Authors:Thomas Bose, Steffen Trimper	Abstract:  We study a stochastic model for tumor cell growth with both multiplicative and additive colored noise as well as a non-zero cross-correlations in between. Whereas the death rate within the logistic model is altered by a deterministic term characterizing immunization, the birth rate is assumed to be stochastically changed due to biological motivated growth processes leading to a multiplicative internal noise. Moreover, the system is subjected to an external additive noise which mimics the influence of the environment of the tumor. The stationary probability distribution Ps is derived depending on the finite correlation time, the immunization rate and the strength of the crosscorrelation. Ps offers a maximum which becomes more pronounced for increasing immunization rate. The mean-first passage time is also calculated in order to find out under which conditions the tumor can suffer extinction. Its characteristics is again controlled by the degree of immunization and the strength of the cross-correlation. The behavior observed can be interpreted in terms of the three state model of a tumor population. 
0808.03353	High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of Theta Car	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yael Naze, Gregor Rauw (ULg)    	Abstract:  Context : The peculiar hot star Theta Car in the open cluster IC2602 is a blue straggler as well as a single-line binary of short period (2.2d). Aims : Its high-energy properties are not well known, though X-rays can provide useful constraints on the energetic processes at work in binaries as well as in peculiar, single objects. Methods : We present the analysis of a 50ks exposure taken with the XMM-Newton observatory. It provides medium as well as high-resolution spectroscopy. Results : Our high-resolution spectroscopy analysis reveals a very soft spectrum with multiple temperature components (1--6MK) and an X-ray flux slightly below the `canonical' value (log[L_X(0.1-10.)/L_{BOL}] ~ -7). The X-ray lines appear surprisingly narrow and unshifted, reminiscent of those of beta Cru and tau Sco. Their relative intensities confirm the anomalous abundances detected in the optical domain (C strongly depleted, N strongly enriched, O slightly depleted). In addition, the X-ray data favor a slight depletion in neon and iron, but they are less conclusive for the magnesium abundance (solar-like?). While no significant changes occur during the XMM-Newton observation, variability in the X-ray domain is detected on the long-term range. The formation radius of the X-ray emission is loosely constrained to <5 R_sol, which allows for a range of models (wind-shock, corona, magnetic confinement,...) though not all of them can be reconciled with the softness of the spectrum and the narrowness of the lines. 
0808.03354	Sharp optical phonon softening close to optimal doping in La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_{4+δ}$	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Matteo D'Astuto (IMPMC), Guy Dhalenne (CHIMSOL), Jeff Graf, Moritz Hoesch (ESRF), Paola Giura (IMPMC), Michael Krisch (ESRF), Patrick Berthet (CHIMSOL), Alessandra Lanzara, Abhay Shukla (IMPMC)    	Abstract:  We report a direct observation of a sharp Kohn-like anomaly in the doubly degenerate copper-oxygen bond-stretching phonon mode occurring at $\mathbf{q}\mathrm{=(0.3, 0,0)}$ in La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_{4+δ}$ with $\mathrm{x=0.14\pm0.01}$, thanks to the high $\mathbf{Q}$ resolution of inelastic x-ray scattering. This anomaly is clearly seen when the inelastic signal is analysed using a single mode but is also consistent with a two mode hypothesis possibly due to a splitting of the degenerate modes due to symmetry breaking stripes. Our observation shows that the effect persists at the stripe propagation vector in a superconducting system close to optimal doping. 
0808.03355	Aging, rejuvenation and thixotropy in complex fluids. Time-dependence of the viscosity at rest and under constant shear rate or shear stress	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Daniel Quemada (MSC)    	Abstract:  Complex fluids exhibit time-dependent changes in viscosity that have been ascribed to both thixotropy and aging. However, there is no consensus for which phenomenon is the origin of which changes. A novel thixotropic model is defined that incorporates aging. Conditions under which viscosity changes are due to thixotropy and aging are unambiguously defined. Viscosity changes in a complex fluid during a period of rest after destructuring exhibit a bifurcation at a critical volume fraction PHIc2. For volume fractions less than PHIc2, the viscosity remains finite in the limit t => infinite. For volume fractions above critical the viscosity grows without limit, so aging occurs at rest. At constant shear rate there is no bifurcation, whereas under constant shear stress the model predicts a new bifurcation in the viscosity at a critical stress sB, identical to the yield stress sy observed under steady conditions. The divergence of the viscosity for stress s sB is best defined as aging. However, for s > sB, where the viscosity remains finite, it seems preferable to use the concepts of restructuring and destructuring, rather than aging and rejuvenation. Nevertheless, when a stress sA (sB) is applied during aging, slower aging is predicted and discussed as true rejuvenation. Plastic behaviour is predicted under steady conditions when s > sB. The Herschel-Bulkley model fits the flow curve for stresses close to sB, whereas the Bingham model gives a better fit for s >> sB. Finally, the model's predictions are shown to be consistent with experimental data from the literature for the transient behaviour of laponite gels. 
0808.03356	Effects of Strong Correlations on the Zero Bias Anomaly in the Extended Hubbard Model with Disorder	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Yun Song, S. Bulut, R. Wortis, W. A. Atkinson	Abstract:  We study the effect of strong correlations on the zero bias anomaly (ZBA) in disordered interacting systems. We focus on the two-dimensional extended Anderson-Hubbard model, which has both on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions on a square lattice. We use a variation of dynamical mean field theory in which the diagonal self-energy is solved self-consistently at each site on the lattice for each realization of the randomly-distributed disorder potential. Since the ZBA occurs in systems with both strong disorder and strong interactions, we use a simplified atomic-limit approximation for the diagonal inelastic self-energy that becomes exact in the large-disorder limit. The off-diagonal self-energy is treated within the Hartree-Fock approximation. The validity of these approximations is discussed in detail. We find that strong correlations have a significant effect on the ZBA at half filling, and enhance the Coulomb gap when the interaction is finite-ranged. 
0808.03357	Power-dependent shaping of vortex solitons in optical lattices with spatially modulated nonlinear refractive index	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Yaroslav V. Kartashov, Victor A. Vysloukh, Lluis Torner	Abstract:  We address vortex solitons supported by optical lattices featuring modulation of both the linear and nonlinear refractive indices. We find that when the modulation is out-of-phase the competition between both effects results in remarkable shape transformations of the solitons which profoundly affect their properties and stability. Nonlinear refractive index modulation is found to impose restrictions on the maximal power of off-site solitons, which are shown to be stable only below a maximum nonlinearity modulation depth. 
0808.03358	LABOCA observations of nearby, active galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Weiss, A. Kovacs, R. Guesten, K. M. Menten, F. Schuller, G. Siringo, E. Kreysa	Abstract:  We present large scale 870 micron maps of the nearby starburst galaxies NGC253, NGC4945 and the nearest giant elliptical radio galaxy Centaurus A (NGC 5128) obtained with the newly commissioned Large Apex Bolometer Camera (LABOCA) operated at the APEX telescope. Our continuum images reveal for the first time the distribution of cold dust at a angular resolution of 20" across the entire optical disks of NGC253 and NGC4945 out to a radial distance of 10' (7.5 kpc). In NGC5128 our LABOCA image also shows, for the first time at submillimeter wavelengths, the synchrotron emission associated with the radio jet and the inner radio lobes. From an analysis of the 870 micron emission in conjunction with ISO-LWS, IRAS and long wavelengths radio data we find temperatures for the cold dust in the disks of all three galaxies of 17-20 K, comparable to the dust temperatures in the disk of the Milky Way. The total gas mass in the three galaxies is determined to be 2.1, 4.2 and 2.8 x 10^9 solar masses for NGC253, NGC4945 and NGC5128, respectively. A detailed comparison between the gas masses derived from the dust continuum and the integrated CO(1-0) intensity in NGC253 suggests that changes of the CO luminosity to molecular mass conversion factor are mainly driven by a metallicity gradient and only to a lesser degree by variations of the CO excitation. An analysis of the synchrotron spectrum in the northern radio lobe of NGC5128 shows that the synchrotron emission from radio to the ultraviolet wavelengths is well described by a broken power law and that the break frequency is a function of the distance from the radio core as expected for aging electrons. We derive an outflow speed of ~0.5c at a distance of 2.6kpc from the center, consistent with the speed derived in the vicinity of the nucleus. 
0808.03359	Josephson current in diffusive multilayer superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor junctions	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Iver B. Sperstad, Jacob Linder, Asle Sudbø	Abstract:  We calculate the Josephson current in a diffusive superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor junction, where the ferromagnetic region contains multiple layers (or domains). In particular, we study a configuration where there are two layers with an arbitrary relative in-plane magnetization orientation, and also include non-ideal interfaces and arbitrary spin-flip scattering. We study the 0-$π$ oscillations of the critical current for varying junction width $d$, and find that the $π$ state vanishes entirely when the magnetic misorientation angle of the two layers exceeds a critical angle $φ_c$. While $φ_c \to π/2$ in the limit of high temperatures, we find that $φ_c$ becomes smaller than $π/2$ at low temperatures compared to $T_c$. 0-$π$ oscillations are also found when varying the temperature or the misorientation angle for fixed values of $d$, and we present phase diagrams that show qualitatively the conditions for the appearance of such oscillations. We also point out how one may obtain significant enhancement of the critical current in such a system by switching the magnetization for selected values of the junction width $d$, and comment on the necessary conditions for establishing a long range triplet Josephson effect. 
0808.03360	Criticality Characteristics of Current Oil Price Dynamics	Statistical Finance (q-fin.ST)	Authors:Stanislaw Drozdz, Jaroslaw Kwapien, Pawel Oswiecimka	Abstract:  Methodology that recently lead us to predict to an amazing accuracy the date (July 11, 2008) of reverse of the oil price up trend is briefly summarized and some further aspects of the related oil price dynamics elaborated. This methodology is based on the concept of discrete scale invariance whose finance-prediction-oriented variant involves such elements as log-periodic self-similarity, the universal preferred scaling factor lambda=2, and allows a phenomenon of the "super-bubble". From this perspective the present (as of August 22, 2008) violent - but still log-periodically decelerating - decrease of the oil prices is associated with the decay of such a "super- bubble" that has started developing about one year ago on top of the longer-term oil price increasing phase (normal bubble) whose ultimate termination is evaluated to occur in around mid 2010. 
0808.03361	Hierarchies of networked phases induced by multiple liquid-liquid critical points	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Chia Wei Hsu, Julio Largo, Francesco Sciortino, Francis W. Starr	Abstract:  Functionalization of nanoparticles or colloids is increasingly being used to develop customizable "atoms". Functionalization by attaching single strands of DNA allows for direct control of the binding between nanoparticles, since hybridization of double strands will only occur if the base sequences of single strands are complementary. Nanoparticles and colloids functionalized by four single strands of DNA can be thought of as designed analogs to tetrahedral network forming atoms and molecules, with a difference that the attached DNA strands allow for control of the length scale of bonding relative to the core size. We explore the behavior of an experimentally realized model for a nanoparticles functionalized by four single strands of DNA (a tetramer), and show that this single-component model exhibits a rich phase diagram with at least three critical points and four thermodynamically distinct amorphous phases. We demonstrate that the additional critical points are part of the Ising universality class, like the ordinary liquid-gas critical point. The dense phases consist of a hierarchy of interpenetrating networks, reminiscent of a woven cloth. Thus bonding specificity of DNA provides an effective route to generate new nano-networked materials with polyamorphic behavior. The concept of network interpenetration helps to explain the generation of multiple liquid phases in single-component systems, suggested to occur in some atomic and molecular network forming fluids, including water and silica. 
0808.03362	Young Nearby Loose Associations	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Carlos A. O. Torres, Germano R. Quast, Claudio H. F. Melo, Michael F. Sterzik	Abstract:  A significant population of stars with ages younger than the Pleiades exists in the solar neighborhood. They are grouped in loose young associations, sharing similar kinematical and physical properties, but, due to their vicinity to the Sun, they are dispersed in the sky, and hard to identify. Their strong stellar coronal activity, causing enhanced X-ray emission, allows them to be identified as counterparts of X-ray sources. The analysis presented here is based mainly on the SACY project, aimed to survey in a systematic way counterparts of ROSAT all-sky X-ray sources in the Southern Hemisphere for which proper motions are known. We give the definition, main properties, and lists of high-probability members of nine confirmed loose young associations that do not belong directly to the well-known Oph-Sco-Cen complex. The youth and vicinity of many members of these new associations make them ideal targets for follow-up studies, specifically geared towards the understanding of planetary system formation. Searches for very low-mass and brown dwarf companions are ongoing, and it will be promising to search for planetary companions with next generation instruments. 
0808.03363	Azimuthally-sensitive femtoscopy from RHIC to LHC in hydrodynamics with statistical hadronization	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Adam Kisiel, Wojciech Broniowski, Mikolaj Chojnacki, Wojciech Florkowski	Abstract:  Azimuthally-sensitive femtoscopy for heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC is explored within the approach consisting of the hydrodynamics of perfect fluid followed by statistical hadronization. It is found that for the RHIC initial conditions the very same framework that reproduces the standard soft observables (including the transverse-momentum spectra, the elliptic flow, and the azimuthally-averaged HBT radii) leads to a proper description of the azimuthally-sensitive femtoscopic observables - we find that the azimuthal variation of the side and out HBT radii is very well reproduced for all centralities, while the out-side correlation is somewhat too large for non-central events. Concerning the dependence of the femtoscopic parameters on kT we find that it is very well reproduced for the out and side radii, and fairly well for the long radius. The model is then extrapolated for the LHC energy. We predict the overall moderate growth of the HBT radii and the decrease of their azimuthal oscillations. Such effects are naturally caused by longer evolution times. In addition, we discuss in detail the space-time patterns of particle emission. We show that they are quite complex and argue that the overall shape seen by the femtoscopic methods cannot be easily disentangled on the basis of simple-minded arguments. 
0808.03364	Optimal Resource Allocation in Random Networks with Transportation Bandwidths	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:C. H. Yeung, K. Y. Michael Wong	Abstract:  We apply statistical physics to study the task of resource allocation in random sparse networks with limited bandwidths for the transportation of resources along the links. Useful algorithms are obtained from recursive relations. Bottlenecks emerge when the bandwidths are small, causing an increase in the fraction of idle links. For a given total bandwidth per node, the efficiency of allocation increases with the network connectivity. In the high connectivity limit, we find a phase transition at a critical bandwidth, above which clusters of balanced nodes appear, characterised by a profile of homogenized resource allocation similar to the Maxwell's construction. 
0808.03365	Pohlmeyer reduction revisited	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:J. Luis Miramontes	Abstract:  A systematic group theoretical formulation of the Pohlmeyer reduction is presented. It provides a map between the equations of motion of sigma models with target-space a symmetric space M=F/G and a class of integrable multi-component generalizations of the sine-Gordon equation. When M is of definite signature their solutions describe classical bosonic string configurations on the curved space-time R_t\times M. In contrast, if M is of indefinite signature the solutions to those equations can describe bosonic string configurations on R_t\times M, M\times S^1_\vartheta or simply M. The conditions required to enable the Lagrangian formulation of the resulting equations in terms of gauged WZW actions with a potential term are clarified, and it is shown that the corresponding Lagrangian action is not unique in general. The Pohlmeyer reductions of sigma models on CP^n and AdS_n are discussed as particular examples of symmetric spaces of definite and indefinite signature, respectively. 
0808.03366	Astrophysical Relevance of Storage-Ring Electron-Ion Recombination Experiments	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Schippers	Abstract:  The relevance of storage-ring electron-ion recombination experiments for astrophysics is outlined. In particular, the role of low-energy dielectronic-recombination resonances is discussed. A bibliographic compilation of electron-ion recombination measurements with cosmically abundant ions is provided. 
0808.03367	Quarkonium production and polarisation with early data at ATLAS	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Darren D. Price	Abstract:  One of the first physics results to come out of ATLAS will be an analysis of J/psi and Upsilon production at 14 TeV. I give an overview of the motivation for looking at the theoretical model underlying quarkonium production, ATLAS expected performance and rates for quarkonium reconstruction and ability to separate out various proposed production models with a view to improving our understanding of QCD. 
0808.03368	Numerical evaluation of the Casimir interaction between cylinders	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:F.C. Lombardo, F.D. Mazzitelli, P.I. Villar	Abstract:  We numerically evaluate the Casimir interaction energy for configurations involving two perfectly conducting eccentric cylinders and a cylinder in front of a plane. We consider in detail several special cases. For quasi-concentric cylinders, we analyze the convergence of a perturbative evaluation based on sparse matrices. For concentric cylinders, we obtain analytically the corrections to the proximity force approximation up to second order, and we present an improved numerical procedure to evaluate the interaction energy at very small distances. Finally, we consider the configuration of a cylinder in front of a plane. We first show numerically that, in the appropriate limit, the Casimir energy for this configuration can be obtained from that of two eccentric cylinders. Then we compute the interaction energy at small distances, and compare the numerical results with the analytic predictions for the first order corrections to the proximity force approximation. 
0808.03369	Debye Sources and the Numerical Solution of the Time Harmonic Maxwell Equations	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Charles L. Epstein, Leslie Greengard	Abstract:  In this paper, we develop a new representation for outgoing solutions to the time harmonic Maxwell equations in unbounded domains in $\bbR^3.$ This representation leads to a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind for solving the problem of scattering from a perfect conductor, which does not suffer from spurious resonances or low frequency breakdown, although it requires the inversion of the scalar surface Laplacian on the domain boundary. In the course of our analysis, we give a new proof of the existence of non-trivial families of time harmonic solutions with vanishing normal components that arise when the boundary of the domain is not simply connected. We refer to these as $k$-Neumann fields, since they generalize, to non-zero wave numbers, the classical harmonic Neumann fields. The existence of $k$-harmonic fields was established earlier by Kress. 
0808.03370	Elementary Charge Transfer Processes in Mesoscopic Conductors	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Mihajlo Vanevic, Yuli V. Nazarov, Wolfgang Belzig	Abstract:  We determine charge transfer statistics in a quantum conductor driven by a time-dependent voltage and identify the elementary transport processes. At zero temperature unidirectional and bidirectional single charge transfers occur. The unidirectional processes involve electrons injected from the source terminal due to excess dc bias voltage. The bidirectional processes involve electron-hole pairs created by time-dependent voltage bias. This interpretation is further supported by the charge transfer statistics in a multiterminal beam splitter geometry in which injected electrons and holes can be partitioned into different outgoing terminals. The probabilities of elementary processes can be probed by noise measurements: the unidirectional processes set the dc noise level while bidirectional ones give rise to the excess noise. For ac voltage drive, the noise oscillates with increasing the driving amplitude. The decomposition of the noise into the contributions of elementary processes identifies the origin of these oscillations: the number of electron-hole pairs generated per cycle increases with increasing the amplitude. The decomposition of the noise into elementary processes is studied for different time-dependent voltages. The method we use is also suitable for systematic calculation of higher-order current correlators at finite temperature. We obtain current noise power and the third cumulant in the presence of time-dependent voltage drive. The charge transfer statistics at finite temperature can be interpreted in terms of multiple charge transfers with probabilities which depend on energy and temperature. 
0808.03371	Number of the QCD critical points with neutral color superconductivity	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Zhao Zhang, Kenji Fukushima, Teiji Kunihiro	Abstract:  We investigate the effect of the electric-charge neutrality in $β$ equilibrium on the chiral phase transition by solving the chiral and diquark condensates in the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We demonstrate that the electric-charge neutrality plays a similar role as the repulsive vector interaction; they both weaken the first-order chiral phase transition in the high-density and low-temperature region. The first-order chiral phase transition is not affected, however, at finite temperatures where the diquark condensate melts. In this way the chiral phase transition could be second-order at intermediate temperatures if the diquark effects overwhelm the chiral dynamics, while the first-order transition may survive at lower and higher temperatures. The number of the critical points appearing on the phase diagram can vary from zero to three, which depends on the relative strength of the chiral and diquark couplings. We systematically study the possibility of the phase structure with multiple QCD critical points and evaluate the Meissner screening mass to confirm that our conclusion is not overturned by chromomagnetic instability. 
0808.03372	Beyond the rainbow: effects from pion back-coupling	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Christian S. Fischer, Richard Williams	Abstract:  We investigate hadronic unquenching effects in light quarks and mesons. To this end we take into account the back-coupling of the pion onto the quark propagator within the non-perturbative continuum framework of Schwinger-Dyson equations (SDE) and Bethe-Salpeter equations (BSE). We improve on a previous approach by explicitly solving both the coupled system of DSEs and BSEs in the complex plane and the normalisation problem for Bethe-Salpeter kernels depending on the total momentum of the meson. As a result of our study we find considerable unquenching effects in the spectrum of light pseudoscalar, vector and axial-vector mesons. 
0808.03373	Quasiharmonic elastic constants corrected for deviatoric thermal stresses	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Pierre Carrier, João F. Justo, Renata M. Wentzcovitch	Abstract:  The quasiharmonic approximation (QHA), in its simplest form also called the statically constrained (SC) QHA, has been shown to be a straightforward method to compute thermoelastic properties of crystals. Recently we showed that for non-cubic solids SC-QHA calculations develop deviatoric thermal stresses at high temperatures. Relaxation of these stresses leads to a series of corrections to the free energy that may be taken to any desired order, up to self-consistency. Here we show how to correct the elastic constants obtained using the SC-QHA. We exemplify the procedure by correcting to first order the elastic constants of MgSiO$_3$-perovskite and MgSiO$_3$-post-perovskite, the major phases of the Earth's lower mantle. We show that this first order correction is quite satisfactory for obtaining the aggregated elastic averages of these minerals and their velocities in the lower mantle. This type of correction is also shown to be applicable to experimental measurements of elastic constants in situations where deviatoric stresses can develop, such as in diamond anvil cells. 
0808.03374	The Corona Australis Star Forming Region	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ralph Neuhäuser (1), Jan Forbrich (2) ((1) AIU, Jena, Germany, (2) CfA, Cambridge, MA, U.S.A.)    	Abstract:  At a distance of about 130 pc, the Corona Australis molecular cloud complex is one of the nearest regions with ongoing and/or recent star formation. It is a region with highly variable extinction of up to AV~45 mag, containing, at its core, the Coronet protostar cluster. There are now 55 known optically detected members, starting at late B spectral types. At the opposite end of the mass spectrum, there are two confirmed brown dwarf members and seven more candidate brown dwarfs. The CrA region has been most widely surveyed at infrared wavelengths, in X-rays, and in the millimeter continuum, while follow-up observations from centimeter radio to X-rays have focused on the Coronet cluster. 
0808.03375	Equilibrium and traveling-wave solutions of plane Couette flow	Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)	Authors:John F. Gibson, Jonathan Halcrow, Predrag Cvitanović	Abstract:  We present ten new equilibrium solutions to plane Couette flow in small periodic cells at low Reynolds number (Re) and two new traveling-wave solutions. The solutions are continued under changes of Re and spanwise period. We provide a partial classification of the isotropy groups of plane Couette flow and show which kinds of solutions are allowed by each isotropy group. We find two complementary visualizations particularly revealing. Suitably chosen sections of their 3D-physical space velocity fields are helpful in developing physical intuition about coherent structures observed in low Re turbulence. Projections of these solutions and their unstable manifolds from their infinite-dimensional state space onto suitably chosen 2- or 3-dimensional subspaces reveal their interrelations and the role they play in organizing turbulence in wall-bounded shear flows. 
0808.03376	United classification of cosmic gamma-ray bursts and their counterparts	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Alexander Kuznetsov	Abstract:  United classification of gamma-ray bursts and their counterparts is established on the basis of measured characteristics: photon energy E and emission duration T. The founded interrelation between the mentioned characteristics of events consists in that, as the energy increases, the duration decreases (and vice versa). The given interrelation reflects the nature of the phenomenon and forms the E-T diagram, which represents a natural classification of all observed events in the energy range from 10E9 to 10E-6 eV and in the corresponding interval of durations from about 10E-2 up to 10E8 s. The proposed classification results in the consequences, which are principal for the theory and practical study of the phenomenon. 
0808.03377	Cosmic X-ray background and Earth albedo Spectra with Swift/BAT	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Ajello, J. Greiner, G. Sato, D. R. Willis, G. Kanbach, A. W. Strong, R. Diehl, G. Hasinger, N. Gehrels, C. B. Markwardt, J. Tueller	Abstract:  We use Swift/BAT Earth occultation data at different geomagnetic latitudes to derive a sensitive measurement of the Cosmic X-ray background (CXB) and of the Earth albedo emission in the 15--200 keV band. We compare our CXB spectrum with recent (INTEGRAL, BeppoSAX) and past results (HEAO-1) and find good agreement. Using an independent measurement of the CXB spectrum we are able to confirm our results. This study shows that the BAT CXB spectrum has a normalization ~8(+/-3)% larger than the HEAO-1 measurement. The BAT accurate Earth albedo spectrum can be used to predict the level of photon background for satellites in low Earth and mid inclination orbits. 
0808.03378	Identifying Deficiencies of Standard Accretion Disk Theory: Lessons from a Mean-Field Approach	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Alexander Hubbard, Eric G. Blackman	Abstract:  Turbulent viscosity is frequently used in accretion disk theory to replace the microphysical viscosity in order to accomodate the observational need for in- stabilities in disks that lead to enhanced transport. However, simply replacing the microphysical transport coefficient by a single turbulent transport coeffi- cient hides the fact that the procedure should formally arise as part of a closure in which the hydrodynamic or magnetohydrodynamic equations are averaged, and correlations of turbulent fluctuations are replaced by transport coefficients. Here we show how a mean field approach leads quite naturally two transport coefficients, not one, that govern mass and angular momentum transport. In particular, we highlight that the conventional approach suffers from a seemingly inconsistent neglect of turbulent diffusion in the surface density equation. We constrain these new transport coefficients for specific cases of inward, outward, and zero net mass transport. In addition, we find that one of the new transport terms can lead to oscillations in the mean surface density which then requires a constant or small inverse Rossby number for disks to maintain a monotonic power-law surface density. 
0808.03379	The effects of Gribov copies in 2D gauge theories	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:D. Dudal, S.P. Sorella, N. Vandersickel, H. Verschelde	Abstract:  In previous works, we have shown that the Gribov-Zwanziger action, which implements the restriction of the domain of integration in the path integral to the Gribov region, generates extra dynamical effects which influence the infrared behaviour of the gluon and ghost propagator in SU(N) Yang-Mills gauge theories. The latter are in good agreement with the most recent lattice data obtained at large volumes, both in 4D and in 3D. More precisely, the gluon propagator is suppressed and does not vanish at zero momentum, while the ghost propagator keeps a 1/p^2 behaviour for p^2\approx0. Instead, in 2D, the lattice data revealed a vanishing zero momentum gluon propagator and an infrared enhanced ghost, in support of the usual Gribov-Zwanziger scenario. We will now show that the 2D version of the Gribov-Zwanziger action still gives results in qualitative agreement with these lattice data, as the peculiar infrared nature of 2D gauge theories precludes the analogue of the dynamical effect otherwise present in 4D and 3D. Simultaneously, we also observe that the Gribov-Zwanziger restriction serves as an infrared regulating mechanism. 
0808.03380	Space-time sensors using multiple-wave atom levitation	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:F. Impens, Ch. J. Bordé	Abstract:  The best clocks to date control the atomic motion by trapping the sample in an optical lattice and then interrogate the atomic transition by shining on these atoms a distinct laser of controlled frequency. In order to perform both tasks simultaneously and with the same laser field, we propose to use instead the levitation of a Bose-Einstein condensate through multiple-wave atomic interferences. The levitating condensate experiences a coherent localization in momentum and a controlled diffusion in altitude. The sample levitation is bound to resonance conditions used either for frequency or for acceleration measurements. The chosen vertical geometry solves the limitations imposed by the sample free fall in previous optical clocks using also atomic interferences. This configuration yields multiple-wave interferences enabling levitation and enhancing the measurement sensitivity. This setup, analogous to an atomic resonator in momentum space, constitutes an attractive alternative to existing atomic clocks and gravimeters. 
0808.03381	Seidel-Smith Cohomology for Tangles	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Reza Rezazadegan	Abstract:  We generalize the "symplectic Khovanov cohomology" of Seidel and Smith to tangles using the notion of symplectic valued topological field theory introduced by Wehrheim and Woodward. 
0808.03382	The Chiral Magnetic Effect	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Kenji Fukushima, Dmitri E. Kharzeev, Harmen J. Warringa	Abstract:  Topological charge changing transitions can induce chirality in the quark-gluon plasma by the axial anomaly. We study the equilibrium response of the quark-gluon plasma in such a situation to an external magnetic field. To mimic the effect of the topological charge changing transitions we will introduce a chiral chemical potential. We will show that an electromagnetic current is generated along the magnetic field. This is the Chiral Magnetic Effect. We compute the magnitude of this current as a function of magnetic field, chirality, temperature, and baryon chemical potential. 
0808.03383	The Ara OB 1a Association	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Scott J. Wolk, Fernando Comeron, Tyler Bourke	Abstract:  The Ara OB1a association is one of the closest sites where triggered star formation is visible for multiple generations of massive stars. At about 1.3 kpc distance, it contains complex environments including cleared young clusters, embedded infrared clusters, CO clouds with no evidence of star formation, and clouds with evidence of ongoing star formation. In this review we discuss the research on this region spanning the last half-century. It has been proposed that the current configuration is the result of an expanding wave of neutral gas set in motion between 10--40 million years ago in combination with photoionization from the current epoch. 
0808.03384	Deducing the nature of dark matter from direct and indirect detection experiments in the absence of collider signatures of new physics	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Maria Beltran, Dan Hooper, Edward W. Kolb, Zosia C. Krusberg	Abstract:  Despite compelling arguments that significant discoveries of physics beyond the standard model are likely to be made at the Large Hadron Collider, it remains possible that this machine will make no such discoveries, or will make no discoveries directly relevant to the dark matter problem. In this article, we study the ability of astrophysical experiments to deduce the nature of dark matter in such a scenario. In most dark matter studies, the relic abundance and detection prospects are evaluated within the context of some specific particle physics model or models (e.g. supersymmetry). Here, we attempt to develop a model-independent approach toward the phenomenology of weakly interacting massive particles in the absence of any discoveries at the Large Hadron Collider. In particular, we consider generic fermionic or scalar dark matter particles with a variety of interaction forms, and calculate the corresponding constraints from and sensitivity of direct and indirect detection experiments. The results may provide some guidance in disentangling information from future direct and indirect detection experiments. 
0808.03385	The Embedded Massive Star Forming Region RCW 38	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Scott J. Wolk, Tyler L. Bourke, Miquela Vigil	Abstract:  RCW~38 is a uniquely young ($<$1 Myr), embedded ($A_V \sim 10$) stellar cluster surrounding a pair of early O stars ($\sim$O5.5) and is one of the few regions within 2 kpc other than Orion to contain over 1000 members. X-ray and deep near-infrared observations reveal a dense cluster with over 200 X-ray sources and 400 infrared sources embedded in a diffuse hot plasma within a 1 pc diameter. The central O star has evacuated its immediate surroundings of dust, creating a wind bubble $\sim$0.1 pc in radius that is confined by the surrounding molecular cloud, as traced by millimeter continuum and molecular line emission. The interface between the bubble and cloud is a region of warm dust and ionized gas, which shows evidence for ongoing star formation. Extended warm dust is found throughout a 2--3 pc region and coincides with extended X-ray plasma. This is evidence that the influence of the massive stars reaches beyond the confines of the O star bubble. RCW~38 appears similar in structure to RCW~49 and M~20 but is at an earlier evolutionary phase. RCW~38 appears to be a blister compact H{\small II} region lying just inside the edge of a giant molecular cloud. 
0808.03386	Linear Programming Formulation of the Boolean Satisfiability Problem	Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)	Authors:Moustapha Diaby	Abstract:  In this paper, we present a new, graph-based modeling approach and a polynomial-sized linear programming (LP) formulation of the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT). The approach is illustrated with a numerical example. 
0808.03387	On the surface of glasses	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Jacob D. Stevenson, Peter G. Wolynes	Abstract:  Dynamics near the surface of glasses is generally much faster than in the bulk. Neglecting static perturbations of structure at the surface, we use random first order transition theory to show the free energy barrier for activated motion near a free surface should be half that of the bulk at the same temperature. The increased mobility allows the surface layers to descend much further on the energy landscape than the bulk ordinarily does. The simplified RFOT calculation however predicts a limiting value for the configurational entropy a vapor deposited glass may reach as a function of deposition rate. We sketch how mode coupling effects extend the excess free surface mobility into the bulk so that the glass transition temperature is measurably perturbed at depths greater than the naive length scale of dynamic cooperativity. 
0808.03388	Quantum Well Based on Graphene and Narrow-Gap Semiconductors	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:P. V. Ratnikov, A. P. Silin	Abstract:  We consider the energy spectrum of the planar quantum well which consisted of two ribbons of narrow-gap semiconductors and a graphene ribbon between ones. It is shown that the gapless mode appears only in case of inverted narrow-gap semiconductors. Spin splitting of the energy spectrum for a nonsymmetric quantum well is calculated taking into account a specificity of graphene. We investigate interface states and optical transitions. It is shown that the optical transitions are possible only with a conservation of a parity. 
0808.03389	Towards Functoriality Of Spinor L-functions	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Bernhard Heim	Abstract:  The object of this work is the spinor L-function of degree 3 and certain degeneration related to the functoriality principle. We study liftings of automorphic forms on the pair of symplectic groups $(\text{GSp}(2),\text{GSp}(4))$ to $\text{GSp}(6)$. We prove cuspidality and demonstrate the compatibility with conjectures of Andrianov, Panchishkin, Deligne and Yoshida. This is done on a motivic and analytic level. We discuss an underlying torus and L-group homomorphism and put our results in the context of the Langlands program. 
0808.03390	Anomalous dimensions of transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution functions	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:N. G. Stefanis, I. O. Cherednikov	Abstract:  We discuss recent developments in the understanding of gauge-invariant transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) parton-distribution functions (PDF). We compute the leading-order $\overline{\text{MS}\vphantom{^1}}$-scheme anomalous dimension of such a quantity in the light-cone gauge and show that it receives a contribution that can be associated with a cusp obstruction at transverse light-cone infinity. This anomalous dimension is intimately related to expectation values composed of fields and eikonal factors along a cusped contour and is absent in covariant gauges. The implications of these findings are addressed and a modified definition of TMD PDFs is proposed. 
0808.03391	Correlations of Prompt and Afterglow Emission in Swift Long and Short Gamma Ray Bursts	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:N. Gehrels, S. D. Barthelmy, D. N. Burrows, J. K. Cannizzo, G. Chincarini, E. Fenimore, C. Kouveliotou, P. O'Brien, D. M. Palmer, J. Racusin, P. W. A. Roming, T. Sakamoto, J. Tueller, R. A. M. J. Wijers, B. Zhang	Abstract:  Correlation studies of prompt and afterglow emissions from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) between different spectral bands has been difficult to do in the past because few bursts had comprehensive and intercomparable afterglow measurements. In this paper we present a large and uniform data set for correlation analysis based on bursts detected by the Swift mission. For the first time, short and long bursts can be analyzed and compared. It is found for both classes that the optical, X-ray and gamma-ray emissions are linearly correlated, but with a large spread about the correlation line; stronger bursts tend to have brighter afterglows, and bursts with brighter X-ray afterglow tend to have brighter optical afterglow. Short bursts are, on average, weaker in both prompt and afterglow emissions. No short bursts are seen with extremely low optical to X-ray ratio as occurs for "dark" long bursts. Although statistics are still poor for short bursts, there is no evidence yet for a subgroup of short bursts with high extinction as there is for long bursts. Long bursts are detected in the dark category at the same fraction as for pre-Swift bursts. Interesting cases are discovered of long bursts that are detected in the optical, and yet have low enough optical to X-ray ratio to be classified as dark. For the prompt emission, short and long bursts have different average tracks on flux vs fluence plots. In Swift, GRB detections tend to be fluence limited for short bursts and flux limited for long events. 
0808.03392	A bracket polynomial for graphs	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:L. Traldi, L. Zulli	Abstract:  A knot diagram has an associated looped interlacement graph, obtained from the intersection graph of the Gauss diagram by attaching loops to the vertices that correspond to negative crossings. This construction suggests an extension of the Kauffman bracket to an invariant of looped graphs, and an extension of Reidemeister equivalence to an equivalence relation on looped graphs. The graph bracket polynomial can be defined recursively using the same pivot and local complementation operations used to define the interlace polynomial, and it gives rise to a graph Jones polynomial that is invariant under the graph Reidemeister moves. 
0808.03393	The Detection of Low Mass Companions in Hyades Cluster Spectroscopic Binary Stars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:C. F. Bender (1), M. Simon (2) ((1) Naval Research Laboratory, (2) Stony Brook University)    	Abstract:  We have observed a large sample of spectroscopic binary stars in the Hyades Cluster, using high resolution infrared spectroscopy to detect low mass companions. We combine our double-lined infrared measurements with well constrained orbital parameters from visible light single-lined observations to derive dynamical mass ratios. Using these results, along with photometry and theoretical mass-luminosity relationships, we estimate the masses of the individual components in our binaries. In this paper we present double-lined solutions for 25 binaries in our sample, with mass ratios from ~0.1-0.8. This corresponds to secondary masses as small as ~0.15 Msun. We include here our preliminary detection of the companion to vB 142, with a very small mass ratio of q=0.06+-0.04; this indicates that the companion may be a brown dwarf. This paper is an initial step in a program to produce distributions of mass ratio and secondary mass for Hyades cluster binaries with a wide range of periods, in order to better understand binary star formation. As such, our emphasis is on measuring these distributions, not on measuring precise orbital parameters for individual binaries. 
0808.03394	On a doubly nonlinear diffusion model of chemotaxis with prevention of overcrowding	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Mostafa Bendahmane, Raimund Brger, Ricardo Ruiz Baier, José Miguel Urbano	Abstract:  This paper addresses the existence and regularity of weak solutions for a fully parabolic model of chemotaxis, with prevention of overcrowding, that degenerates in a two-sided fashion, including an extra nonlinearity represented by a $p$-Laplacian diffusion term. To prove the existence of weak solutions, a Schauder fixed-point argument is applied to a regularized problem and the compactness method is used to pass to the limit. The local Hölder regularity of weak solutions is established using the method of intrinsic scaling. The results are a contribution to showing, qualitatively, to what extent the properties of the classical Keller-Segel chemotaxis models are preserved in a more general setting. Some numerical examples illustrate the model. 
0808.03395	Numerical validation of the Complex Swift-Hohenberg equation for lasers	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Juan M. Pedrosa, Miguel Hoyuelos, Carlos Martel	Abstract:  Order parameter equations, such as the complex Swift-Hohenberg (CSH) equation, offer a simplified and universal description that hold close to an instability threshold. The universality of the description refers to the fact that the same kind of instability produces the same order parameter equation. In the case of lasers, the instability usually corresponds to the emitting threshold, and the CSH equation can be obtained from the Maxwell-Bloch (MB) equations for a class C laser with small detuning. In this paper we numerically check the validity of the CSH equation as an approximation of the MB equations, taking into account that its terms are of different asymptotic order, and that, despite of having been systematically overlooked in the literature, this fact is essential in order to correctly capture the weakly nonlinear dynamics of the MB. The approximate distance to threshold range for which the CSH equation holds is also estimated. 
0808.03396	Nano-Graphene Oxide for Cellular Imaging and Drug Delivery	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Xiaoming Sun, Zhuang Liu, Kevin Welsher, Joshua Tucker Robinson, Andrew Goodwin, Sasa Zaric, Hongjie Dai	Abstract:  Two-dimensional graphene offers interesting electronic, thermal and mechanical properties that are currently explored for advanced electronics, membranes and composites. Here we synthesize and explore the biological application of nano-graphene oxide NGO, single-layer graphene oxide sheets down to a few nanometers in lateral width. We develop functionalization chemistry to impart solubility and compatibility of NGO in biological environments. We obtain size separated pegylated NGO sheets that are soluble in buffers and serum without agglomeration. The NGO sheets are found to be photoluminescent in the visible and infrared regions. The intrinsic photoluminescence of NGO is used for live cell imaging in the near-infrared with little background. We found that simple physisorption via pi-stacking can be used for loading doxorubicin, a widely used cancer drug onto NGO functionalized with antibody for selective cancer cell killing in vitro. Owing to the small size, intrinsic optical properties, large specific surface area,low cost, and useful non-covalent interactions with aromatic drug molecules, NGO is a promising new material for biological and medical applications. 
0808.03397	Weighted-Interaction Nestedness Estimator (WINE): A new estimator to calculate over frequency matrices	Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)	Authors:Javier Galeano, Juan M. Pastor, Jose M Iriondo	Abstract:  We have developed a graphical user interface (GUI) running in Matlab, called Weighted-Interaction Nestedness Estimator, WINE (Fig. 1). WINE is a Matlab application developed to perform the calculation of the new weighted nestedness estimator. This program allows the user to: open a data file, select the range of data to be analysed, and calculate the results, obtaining two graphics and three indices. The indices shown in the graphical interface are: a) weighted nestedness of the frequency matrix, b) average weighted nestedness of 100 random matrices of similar characteristics, and c) the new weighted- interaction nestedness estimator, which compares the two previous results. 
0808.03398	Unconventional superconductivity of NdFeAsO0.82F0.18 indicated by the low temperature dependence of the lower critical field Hc1	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:X.L. Wang, S. X. Dou, Zhi-An Ren, Wei Yi, Zheng-Cai Li, Zhong-Xian Zhao, Sung-IK Lee	Abstract:  We measured the initial M-H curves for a sample of the newly discovered superconductor NdFeAsO0.82Fe0.18, which had a critical temperature, Tc, of 51 K, and was fabricated at the high pressure of 6 GPa. The lower critical field, Hc1, was extracted from the deviation point of the Meissner linearity in the M-H curves, which show linear temperature dependence in the low temperature region down to 5 K. The Hc1(T) indicates no s-wave superconductivity, but rather an unconventional superconductivity with a nodal gap structure. Furthermore, the linearity of Hc1 at low temperature does not hold at high temperature, but shows other characteristics, indicating that this superconductor might have multi-gap features. Based on the low temperature nodal gap structure, we estimate that the maximum gap magnitude delta 0 = (1.6+- 0.2) kBTc. 
0808.03399	LRSA: A new computational method for analyzing time course microarray data	Applications (stat.AP)	Authors:Wei Wu, Nilesh B. Dave, Naftali Kaminski	Abstract:  Motivation: Time course data obtained from biological samples subject to specific treatments can be very useful for revealing complex and novel biological phenomena. Although an increasing number of time course microarray datasets becomes available, most of them contain few biological replicates and time points. So far there are few computational methods that can effectively reveal differentially expressed genes and their patterns in such data. Results: We have proposed a new two-step nonparametric statistical procedure, LRSA, to reveal differentially expressed genes and their expression trends in temporal microarray data. We have also employed external controls as a surrogate to estimate false discovery rates and thus to guide the discovery of differentially expressed genes. Our results showed that LRSA reveals substantially more differentially expressed genes and have much lower than two other methods, STEM and ANOVA, in both real data and the simulated data. Our computational results are confirmed using real-time PCRs. Contact: wuw2@upmc.edu 
0808.03400	Comprehensive Two-Point Analyses of Weak Gravitational Lensing Surveys	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Gary M. Bernstein	Abstract:  We present a framework for analyzing weak gravitational lensing survey data, including lensing and source-density observables, plus spectroscopic redshift calibration data. All two-point observables are predicted in terms of parameters of a perturbed Robertson-Walker metric, making the framework independent of the models for gravity, dark energy, or galaxy properties. For Gaussian fluctuations the 2-point model determines the survey likelihood function and allows Fisher-matrix forecasting. The framework includes nuisance terms for the major systematic errors: shear measurement errors, magnification bias and redshift calibration errors, intrinsic galaxy alignments, and inaccurate theoretical predictions. We propose flexible parameterizations of the many nuisance parameters related to galaxy bias and intrinsic alignment. For the first time we can integrate many different observables and systematic errors into a single analysis. As a first application of this framework, we demonstrate that: uncertainties in power-spectrum theory cause very minor degradation to cosmological information content; nearly all useful information (excepting baryon oscillations) is extracted with ~3 bins per decade of angular scale; and the rate at which galaxy bias varies with redshift substantially influences the strength of cosmological inference. The framework will permit careful study of the interplay between numerous observables, systematic errors, and spectroscopic calibration data for large weak-lensing surveys. 
0808.03401	Substructures in hydrodynamical cluster simulations	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:K. Dolag, S. Borgani, G. Murante, V. Springel	Abstract:  The abundance and structure of dark matter subhalos has been analyzed extensively in recent studies of dark matter-only simulations, but comparatively little is known about the impact of baryonic physics on halo substructures. We here extend the SUBFIND algorithm for substructure identification such that it can be reliably applied to dissipative hydrodynamical simulations that include star formation. This allows, in particular, the identification of galaxies as substructures in simulations of clusters of galaxies, and a determination of their content of gravitationally bound stars, dark matter, and hot and cold gas. Using a large set of cosmological cluster simulations, we present a detailed analysis of halo substructures in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, focusing in particular on the influence both of radiative and non-radiative gas physics, and of non-standard physics such as thermal conduction and feedback by galactic outflows. We also examine the impact of numerical nuisance parameters such as artificial viscosity parameterizations. We find that diffuse hot gas is efficiently stripped from subhalos when they enter the highly pressurized cluster atmosphere. This has the effect of decreasing the subhalo mass function relative to a corresponding dark matter-only simulation. These effects are mitigated in radiative runs, where baryons condense in the central subhalo regions and form compact stellar cores. However, in all cases, only a very small fraction, of the order of one percent, of subhalos within the cluster virial radii preserve a gravitationally bound hot gaseous atmosphere. (abridged) 
0808.03402	Call option prices based on Bessel processes	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Ju-Yi Yen, Marc Yor	Abstract:  As a complement to some recent work by Pal and Protter, "Strict local martingales, bubbles, and no early exercise", we show that the call option prices associated with the Bessel strict local martingales are integrable over time, and we discuss the probability densities obtained thus. 
0808.03403	Reexamination of decoherence in quantum walks on the hypercube	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Frederick W. Strauch	Abstract:  The effect of decoherence on the continuous-time quantum walk on the hypercube is revisited. Previously, an exact solution was found for a decoherence model that preserved the effective tensor-product form of the dynamics. Here a new model is presented, inspired by perfect quantum state transfer in qubit networks. A perturbative solution is found for the dynamics of this model which is not of a tensor-product form. In contrast to previous results, the hitting probability has a lower bound that is independent of the hypercube dimension. 
0808.03404	Linearized Turbulent Fluid Flow as an Analog Model for Linearized General Relativity (Gravitoelectromagnetism)	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:H. E. Puthoff	Abstract:  In the spirit of analog models of and for general relativity, we explore the isomorphism between the equations of linearized turbulent fluid flow and those of the linearized form of GR, gravitoelectromagnetism. The correspondence between the truncated Reynolds system for turbulent fluid flow and the Maxwell-like gravitoelectromagnetic equations for weak-field GR is shown to provide yet another example of the relationship between the representation of fluctuations in background media and curved spacetime formulations. 
0808.03405	The SL(2)-type and Base Change	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Omer Offen, Eitan Sayag	Abstract:  The SL(2)-type of any smooth, irreducible and unitarizable representation of GL(n) over a p-adic field was defined by Venkatesh. We provide a natural way to extend the definition to all smooth and irreducible representations. For unitarizable representations we show that the SL(2)-type of a representation is preserved under base change with respect to any finite extension. The Klyachko model of a smooth, irreducible and unitarizable representation πof GL(n) depends only on the SL(2)-type of π. As a consequence we observe that the Klyachko model of πand of its base-change are of the same type. 
0808.03406	Higher Poisson Brackets and Differential Forms	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:H. M. Khudaverdian, Th. Th. Voronov	Abstract:  We show how the relation between Poisson brackets and symplectic forms can be extended to the case of inhomogeneous multivector fields and inhomogeneous differential forms (or pseudodifferential forms). In particular we arrive at a notion which is a generalization of a symplectic structure and gives rise to higher Poisson brackets. We also obtain a construction of Koszul type brackets in this setting. 
0808.03407	The close environment of 24 micron galaxies at 0.6<z<1.0 in the COSMOS field	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:K. I. Caputi, K. Kovac, M. Bolzonella, S. J. Lilly, G. Zamorani, H. Aussel, D. Sanders, S. Bardelli, A. Bongiorno, T. Contini, G. Coppa, O. Cucciati, S. de la Torre, L. de Ravel, P. Franzetti, D. Frayer, B. Garilli, A. Iovino, P. Kampczyk, J.-P. Kneib, C. Knobel, F. Lamareille, J.-F. Le Borgne, V. Le Brun, O. Le Fevre, E. Le Floc'h, A. Leauthaud, C. Maier, V. Mainieri, M. Mignoli, R. Pello, Y. Peng, E. Perez-Montero, E. Ricciardelli, M. Salvato, M. Scodeggio, N. Scoville, J. Silverman, J. Surace, M. Tanaka, L. Tasca, L. Tresse, D. Vergani, E. Zucca, U. Abbas, D. Bottini, P. Capak, A. Cappi, C. M. Carollo, P. Cassata, A. Cimatti, M. Fumana, O. Ilbert, J. Kartaltepe, D. Maccagni, C. Marinoni, H. McCracken, P. Memeo, B. Meneux, P. Oesch, C. Porciani, L. Pozzetti, A. Renzini, R. Scaramella, C. Scarlata	Abstract:  We investigate the close environment of 203 Spitzer 24 micron-selected sources at 0.6<z<1.0 using zCOSMOS-bright redshifts and spectra of I<22.5 AB mag galaxies, over 1.5 sq. deg. of the COSMOS field. We quantify the degree of passivity of the LIRG and ULIRG environments by analysing the fraction of close neighbours with Dn(4000)>1.4. We find that LIRGs at 0.6<z<0.8 live in more passive environments than those of other optical galaxies that have the same stellar mass distribution. Instead, ULIRGs inhabit more active regions (e.g. LIRGs and ULIRGs at 0.6<z<0.8 have, respectively, (42.0 +/- 4.9)% and (24.5 +/- 5.9)% of neighbours with Dn (4000)>1.4 within 1 Mpc and +/- 500 km/s). The contrast between the activities of the close environments of LIRGs and ULIRGs appears especially enhanced in the COSMOS field density peak at z~0.67, because LIRGs on this peak have a larger fraction of passive neighbours, while ULIRGs have as active close environments as those outside the large-scale structure. The differential environmental activity is related to the differences in the distributions of stellar mass ratios between LIRGs/ULIRGs and their close neighbours, as well as in the general local density fields. At 0.8<z<1.0, instead, we find no differences in the environment densities of ULIRGs and other similarly massive galaxies, in spite of the differential activities. We discuss a possible scenario to explain these findings. 
0808.03408	Near-isotropic performance of intrinsically anisotropic high-temperature superconducting tapes due to self-assembled nanostructures	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Y. L. Zuev, D. K. Christen, S. H. Wee, A. Goyal, S. W. Cook	Abstract:  High-temperature superconductors (HTS) are finding use as high - current wires for potential application in power devices. The dependence of their basal-plane critical current properties on orientation in a magnetic field can pose important design problems. Here we report material and operating parameter conditions where prototype HTS tape conductors exhibit critical current characteristics that are essentially field-orientation independent. The novel phenomenon is observed for specific magnetic field intensities that depend on the operating temperature, and in materials having strong flux pinning by extended nanoscale structures aligned roughly along the HTS crystalline c-axis. The effect can be described by a simple model for the field dependence of critical current density, generalized for anisotropic electronic response. This description may provide insight into means to fine-tune the material properties for nearly isotropic performance characteristics at a preferred field and temperature. 
0808.03409	Stability and normal zone propagation speed in YBCO coated conductors with increased interfacial resistance	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:George A. Levin, Paul N. Barnes, Jose P. Rodriguez, Jake A. Connors, John S. Bulmer	Abstract:  We will discuss how stability and speed of normal zone propagation in YBCO-coated conductors is affected by interfacial resistance between the superconducting film and the stabilizer. Our numerical simulation has shown that the increased interfacial resistance substantially increases speed of normal zone propagation and decreases the stability margins. Optimization of the value of the resistance may lead to a better compromise between stability and quench protection requirements than what is found in currently manufactured coated conductors. 
0808.03410	Interacting String Multi-verses and Holographic Instabilities of Massive Gravity	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Elias Kiritsis, Vasilis Niarchos	Abstract:  Products of large-N conformal field theories coupled by multi-trace interactions in diverse dimensions are used to define quantum multi-gravity (multi-string theory) on a union of (asymptotically) AdS spaces. One-loop effects generate a small O(1/N) mass for some of the gravitons. The boundary gauge theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence are used as guiding principles to study and draw conclusions on some of the well known problems of massive gravity - classical instabilities and strong coupling effects. We find examples of stable multi-graviton theories where the usual strong coupling effects of the scalar mode of the graviton are suppressed. Our examples require a fine tuning of the boundary conditions in AdS. Without it, the spacetime background backreacts in order to erase the effects of the graviton mass. 
0808.03411	Objects In Telescope Are Farther Than They Appear: How diffraction tricked Galileo into mismeasuring the distances to the stars	History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)	Authors:Christopher M. Graney	Abstract:  Galileo determined distances to stars based on the assumption that stars were suns, the apparent sizes of stars as seen through his telescope, and basic geometry. However, the apparent sizes that he measured were the result of diffraction and not related to the actual sizes of the stars. Galileo's methods and observations were good, but since he was unknowingly observing diffraction artifacts and not the physical bodies of stars he greatly underestimated the distances to the stars. 
0808.03412	Complete Constant Mean Curvature surfaces and Bernstein type Theorems in $\mathbb{M}^2\times \mathbb{R}$	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Jose M. Espinar, Harold Rosenberg	Abstract:  In this paper we study constant mean curvature surfaces $Σ$ in a product space, $\mathbb{M}^2\times \mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{M}^2$ is a complete Riemannian manifold. We assume the angle function $ν= \meta{N}{\partial_t}$ does not change sign on $Σ$. We classify these surfaces according to the infimum $c(Σ)$ of the Gaussian curvature of the projection of $Σ$. When $H \neq 0$ and $c(Σ)\geq 0$, then $Σ$ is a cylinder over a complete curve with curvature 2H. If H=0 and $c(Σ) \geq 0$, then $Σ$ must be a vertical plane or $Σ$ is a slice $\mathbb{M}^2 \times {t}$, or $\mathbb{M}^2 \equiv \mathbb{R}^2$ with the flat metric and $Σ$ is a tilted plane (after possibly passing to a covering space). When $c(Σ)<0$ and $H>\sqrt{-c(Σ)} /2$, then $Σ$ is a vertical cylinder over a complete curve of $\mathbb{M}^2$ of constant geodesic curvature $2H$. This result is optimal. We also prove a non-existence result concerning complete multi-graphs in $\mathbb{M}^2\times \mathbb{R}$, when $c(\mathbb{M}^2)<0$. 
0808.03413	Comments on anomaly versus WKB/tunneling methods for calculating Unruh radiation	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Valeria Akhmedova, Terry Pilling, Andrea de Gill, Douglas Singleton	Abstract:  In this Letter we make a critique of, and comparison between, the anomaly method and WKB/tunneling method for obtaining radiation from non-trivial spacetime backgrounds. We focus on Rindler spacetime (the spacetime of an accelerating observer) and the associated Unruh radiation since this is the prototype of the phenomena of radiation from a spacetime, and it is the simplest model for making clear subtle points in the tunneling and anomaly methods. Our analysis leads to the following conclusions: (i) neither the consistent and covariant anomaly methods gives the correct Unruh temperature for Rindler spacetime and in some cases (e.g. de Sitter spacetime) the consistent and covariant methods disagree with one another; (ii) the tunneling method can be applied in all cases, but it has a previously unnoticed temporal contribution which must be accounted for in order to obtain the correct temperature. 
0808.03414	Common Proper Motion Companions to Nearby Stars: Ages and Evolution	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:V. V. Makarov, N. Zacharias, G. S. Hennessy	Abstract:  A set of 41 nearby stars (closer than 25 pc) is investigated which have very wide binary and common proper motion (CPM) companions at projected separations between 1000 and $200 000$ AU. These companions are identified by astrometric positions and proper motions from the NOMAD catalog. Based mainly on measures of chromospheric and X-ray activity, age estimation is obtained for most of 85 identified companions. Color -- absolute magnitude diagrams are constructed to test if CPM companions are physically related to the primary nearby stars and have the same age. Our carefully selected sample includes three remote white dwarf companions to main sequence stars and two systems (55 Cnc and GJ 777A) of multiple planets and distant stellar companions. Ten new CPM companions, including three of extreme separations, are found. Multiple hierarchical systems are abundant; more than 25% of CPM components are spectroscopic or astrometric binaries or multiples themselves. Two new astrometric binaries are discovered among nearby CPM companions, GJ 264 and HIP 59000 and preliminary orbital solutions are presented. The Hyades kinematic group (or stream) is presented broadly in the sample, but we find few possible thick disk objects and none halo stars. It follows from our investigation that moderately young (age $\lesssim 1$ Gyr) thin disk dwarfs are the dominating species in the near CPM systems, in general agreement with the premises of the dynamical survival paradigm. Some of the multiple stellar systems with remote CPM companions probably undergo the dynamical evolution on non-coplanar orbits, known as the Kozai cycle. 
0808.03415	On the Cayley semigroup of a finite aperiodic semigroup	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Avi Mintz	Abstract:  Let $S$ be a finite semigroup. In this paper we introduce the functions $φ_s:S^* \to S^*$, first defined by Rhodes, given by $φ_s([a_1,a_2 ,...,a_n]) = [sa_1,sa_1a_2,..., sa_1a_2 ... a_n]$. We show that if $S$ is a finite aperiodic semigroup, then the semigroup generated by the functions $\{φ_s\}_{s \in S}$ is finite and aperiodic. 
0808.03416	Uncertainty quantification in complex systems using approximate solvers	Computation (stat.CO)	Authors:Phaedon-Stelios Koutsourelakis	Abstract:  This paper proposes a novel uncertainty quantification framework for computationally demanding systems characterized by a large vector of non-Gaussian uncertainties. It combines state-of-the-art techniques in advanced Monte Carlo sampling with Bayesian formulations. The key departure from existing works is the use of inexpensive, approximate computational models in a rigorous manner. Such models can readily be derived by coarsening the discretization size in the solution of the governing PDEs, increasing the time step when integration of ODEs is performed, using fewer iterations if a non-linear solver is employed or making use of lower order models. It is shown that even in cases where the inexact models provide very poor approximations of the exact response, statistics of the latter can be quantified accurately with significant reductions in the computational effort. Multiple approximate models can be used and rigorous confidence bounds of the estimates produced are provided at all stages. 
0808.03417	Self-healing diffusion quantum Monte Carlo algorithms: methods for direct reduction of the fermion sign error in electronic structure calculations	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Fernando A. Reboredo, Randolph Q. Hood, Paul R. C. Kent	Abstract:  We develop a formalism and present an algorithm for optimization of the trial wave-function used in fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) methods. We take advantage of a basic property of the walker configuration distribution generated in a DMC calculation, to (i) project-out a multi-determinant expansion of the fixed-node ground-state wave function and (ii) to define a cost function that relates the fixed-node ground-state and the non-interacting trial wave functions. We show that (a) locally smoothing out the kink of the fixed-node ground-state wave function at the node generates a new trial wave-function with better nodal structure and (b) we argue that the noise in the fixed-node wave-function resulting from finite sampling plays a beneficial role, allowing the nodes to adjust towards the ones of the exact many-body ground state in a simulated annealing-like process. We propose a method to improve both single determinant and multi-determinant expansions of the trial wave-function. We test the method in a model system where benchmark configuration interaction calculations can be performed. Comparing the DMC calculations with the exact solutions, we find that the trial wave-function is systematically improved. The overlap of the optimized trial wave function and the exact ground state converges to 100% even starting from wave-functions orthogonal to the exact ground state. In the optimization process we find an optimal non-interacting nodal potential of density-functional-like form whose existence was predicted earlier[Phys.Rev. B {\bf 77}, 245110 (2008)]. We obtain the exact Kohn-Sham effective potential from the DMC data. 
0808.03418	Jamming in Fixed-Rate Wireless Systems with Power Constraints - Part II: Parallel Slow Fading Channels	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:George T. Amariucai, Shuangqing Wei, Rajgopal Kannan	Abstract:  This is the second part of a two-part paper that studies the problem of jamming in a fixed-rate transmission system with fading. In the first part, we studied the scenario with a fast fading channel, and found Nash equilibria of mixed strategies for short term power constraints, and for average power constraints with and without channel state information (CSI) feedback. We also solved the equally important maximin and minimax problems with pure strategies. Whenever we dealt with average power constraints, we decomposed the problem into two levels of power control, which we solved individually. In this second part of the paper, we study the scenario with a parallel, slow fading channel, which usually models multi-carrier transmissions, such as OFDM. Although the framework is similar as the one in Part I \cite{myself3}, dealing with the slow fading requires more intricate techniques. Unlike in the fast fading scenario, where the frames supporting the transmission of the codewords were equivalent and completely characterized by the channel statistics, in our present scenario the frames are unique, and characterized by a specific set of channel realizations. This leads to more involved inter-frame power allocation strategies, and in some cases even to the need for a third level of power control. We also show that for parallel slow fading channels, the CSI feedback helps in the battle against jamming, as evidenced by the significant degradation to system performance when CSI is not sent back. We expect this degradation to decrease as the number of parallel channels $M$ increases, until it becomes marginal for $M\to \infty$ (which can be considered as the case in Part I). 
0808.03419	Probing Dark Energy with Black Hole Binaries	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Laura Mersini-Houghton, Adam Kelleher	Abstract:  The equation of state (EoS) of dark energy $w$ remains elusive despite enormous experimental efforts to pin down its value and its time variation. Yet it is the single most important handle we have in our understanding of one of the most mysterious puzzle in nature, dark energy. This letter proposes a new method for measuring the EoS of dark energy by using the gravitational waves (GW) of black hole binaries. The method described here offers an alternative to the standard way of large scale surveys. It is well known that the mass of a black hole changes due to the accretion of dark energy but at an extremely slow rate. However, a binary of supermassive black holes (SBH) radiates gravitational waves with a power proportional to the masses of these accreting stars and thereby carries information on dark energy. These waves can propagate through the vastness of structure in the universe unimpeded. The orbital changes of the binary, induced by the energy loss from gravitational radiation, receive a large contribution from dark energy accretion. This contribution is directly proportional to $(1+w)$ and is dominant for SBH binaries with separation $R \ge 1000$ parsec, thereby accelerating the merging process for $w > -1$ or ripping the stars apart for phantom dark energy with $w < -1$. Such orbital changes, therefore $w$, can be detected with LIGO and LISA near merging time, or with X-ray and radio measurements of Chandra and VLBA experiments. 
0808.03420	Ab initio no-core full configuration calculations of light nuclei	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:P. Maris, J. P. Vary, A. M. Shirokov	Abstract:  We perform no-core full configuration calculations for a set of light nuclei including $^{16}$O with a realistic NN interaction, JISP16. We obtain ground state energies and their uncertainties through exponential extrapolations that we demonstrate are reliable in $^2$H, $^3$H and $^4$He test cases where fully converged results are obtained directly. We find that $^6$He, $^6$Li and $^8$He are underbound by about 600 keV, 560 keV and 1.7 MeV, respectively. $^{12}$C is overbound by about 1.7 MeV and $^{16}$O is overbound by about 16 MeV. The first excited $0^+$ states in $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O are also evaluated but their uncertainties are significantly larger than the uncertainties for the ground states.

0808.03422	Dynamics of barred galaxies: effects of disk height	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Klypin, O. Valenzuela, P. Colin, T. Quinn	Abstract:  We study dynamics of bars in models of disk galaxies embeded in realistic dark matter halos. We find that disk thickness plays an important, if not dominant, role in the evolution and structure of the bars. We also make extensive numerical tests of different N-body codes used to study bar dynamics. Models with thick disks typically used in this type of modeling (height-to-length ratio hz/Rd=0.2) produce slowly rotating, and very long, bars. In contrast, more realistic thin disks with the same parameters as in our Galaxy (hz/Rd= 0.1) produce bars with normal length Rbar approx R_d, which rotate quickly with the ratio of the corotation radius to the bar radius 1.2-1.4 compatible with observations. Bars in these models do not show a tendency to slow down, and may lose as little as 2-3 percent of their angular momentum due to dynamical friction with the dark matter over cosmological time. We attribute the differences between the models to a combined effect of high phase-space density and smaller Jeans mass in the thin disk models, which result in the formation of a dense central bulge. Special attention is paid to numerical effects such as the accuracy of orbital integration, force and mass resolution. Using three N-body codes -- Gadget, ART, and Pkdgrav -- we find that numerical effects are very important and, if not carefully treated, may produce incorrect and misleading results. Once the simulations are performed with sufficiently small time-steps and with adequate force and mass resolution, all the codes produce nearly the same results: we do not find any systematic deviations between the results obtained with TREE codes (Gadget and Pkdgrav) and with the Adaptive-Mesh-Refinement (ART) code.

Liu	Abstract:  Nonlinear magnetotransport of a microwave-irradiated high mobility two-dimensional electron system under a finite direct current excitation is analyzed using a dc-controlled scheme with photon-assisted transition mechanism. The predicted amplitudes, extrema and nodes of the oscillatory differential resistance versus the magnetic field and the current density, are in excellent agreement with the recent experimental observation [Hatke et al. Phys. Rev. B 77, 201304(R) (2008)]. 
0808.03424	The Range of a Class of Classifiable Separable Simple Amenable C*-Algebras	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Huaxin Lin, Zhuang Niu	Abstract:  We study the range of a classifiable class ${\cal A}$ of unital separable simple amenable $C^*$-algebras which satisfy the Universal Coefficient Theorem. The class ${\cal A}$ contains all unital simple AH-algebras. We show that all unital simple inductive limits of dimension drop circle $C^*$-algebras are also in the class. This unifies some of the previous known classification results for unital simple amenable $C^*$-algebras. We also show that there are many other $C^*$-algebras in the class. We prove that, for any partially ordered, simple weakly unperforated rationally Riesz group $G_0$ with order unit $u,$ any countable abelian group $G_1,$ any metrizable Choquet simplex $S,$ and any surjective affine continuous map $r: S\to S_u(G_0)$ (where $S_u(G_0)$ is the state space of $G_0$) which preserves extremal points, there exists one and only one (up to isomorphism) unital separable simple amenable $C^*$-algebra $A$ in the classifiable class ${\cal A}$ such that $$ ((K_0(A), K_0(A)_+, [1_A]), K_1(A), T(A), λ_A)=((G_0, (G_0)_+, u), G_1,S, r). 
0808.03425	LSST and the Dark Sector: Image Processing Challenges	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J.A. Tyson (1), C. Roat (2), J. Bosch (1), D. Wittman (1) ((1) UC Davis, (2) Google)    	Abstract:  Next generation probes of dark matter and dark energy require high precision reconstruction of faint galaxy shapes from hundreds of dithered exposures. Current practice is to stack the images. While valuable for many applications, this stack is a highly compressed version of the data. Future weak lensing studies will require analysis of the full dataset using the stack and its associated catalog only as a starting point. We describe a "Multi-Fit" algorithm which simultaneously fits individual galaxy exposures to a common profile model convolved with each exposure's point spread function at that position in the image. This technique leads to an enhancement of the number of usable small galaxies at high redshift and, more significantly, a decrease in systematic shear error.

Haines	Abstract:  Clozel and Labesse proved the base change fundamental lemma for spherical Hecke algebras attached to an unramified group over a p-adic field. This paper proves an analogous fundamental lemma for centers of parahoric Hecke algebras attached to the same class of groups. This provides an ingredient needed for the author's program to study Shimura varieties with parahoric level structure at p.

We present tunneling and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements at the surface of cavity-grade niobium samples coated with a 3 nm alumina overlayer deposited by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). The coated samples baked in ultra high vacuum (UHV) at low temperature reveal at first degraded superconducting surface. However, at temperatures above 450C, the tunneling conductance curves show significant improvements of the superconducting density of states (DOS) compared with untreated surfaces.

0808.03430	Ward-Takahashi identity for Yang-Mills theory in the Exact Renormalization Group	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Yuji Igarashi, Katsumi Itoh, Hidenori Sonoda	Abstract:  We give a functional derivation of the Ward-Takahashi identity for Yang-Mills theory in the framework of the exact renormalization group. The identity realizes non-abelian gauge symmetry nontrivially despite the presence of a momentum cutoff. The cutoff deforms the gauge transformation by introducing composite operators. In our functional method, which is an extension of the method used in our previous work on QED, these composite operators are expressed in terms of the Wilson action that depends on both a UV cutoff and an IR cutoff. 
0808.03431	Jamming in Fixed-Rate Wireless Systems with Power Constraints - Part I: Fast Fading Channels	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:George T. Amariucai, Shuangqing Wei	Abstract:  This is the first part of a two-part paper that studies the problem of jamming in a fixed-rate transmission system with fading. Both transmitter and jammer are subject to power constraints which can be enforced over each codeword short-term / peak) or over all codewords (long-term / average), hence generating different scenarios. All our jamming problems are formulated as zero-sum games, having the probability of outage as pay-off function and power control functions as strategies. The paper aims at providing a comprehensive coverage of these problems, under fast and slow fading, peak and average power constraints, pure and mixed strategies, with and without channel state information (CSI) feedback. In this first part we study the fast fading scenario. We first assume full CSI to be available to all parties. For peak power constraints, a Nash equilibrium of pure strategies is found. For average power constraints, both pure and mixed strategies are investigated. With pure strategies, we derive the optimal power control functions for both intra-frame and inter-frame power allocation. Maximin and minimax solutions are found and shown to be different, which implies the non-existence of a saddle point. In addition we provide alternative perspectives in obtaining the optimal intra-frame power control functions under the long-term power constraints. With mixed strategies, the Nash equilibrium is found by solving the generalized form of an older problem dating back to Bell and Cover \cite{bell}. Finally, we derive a Nash equilibrium of the game in which no CSI is fed back from the receiver. We show that full channel state information brings only a very slight improvement in the system's performance. 
0808.03432	Comment on "Discrepancies in the resonance-fluorescence spectrum calculated with two methods"	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Z. Ficek	Abstract:  There are two alternative methods used in literature to calculate the incoherent part of the spectrum of light scattered by an atomic system. In the first, one calculates the spectrum of the total light scattered by the system and obtains the incoherent part by subtracting the coherent part. In the second method, one introduces the fluctuation operators and obtains the incoherent part of the spectrum by taking the Fourier transform of the two time correlation function of the fluctuation operators. These two methods have been recognized for years as two completely equivalent for evaluating the incoherent part of the spectrum. In a recent paper Qing Xu et al. [Phys. Rev. A 78, 013407 (2008)] have shown that there are discrepancies between the incoherent parts of the stationary spectrum of a three-level Lambda-type system calculated with these two methods. The predicted discrepancies can be severe that over a wide rage of the Rabi frequencies and atomic decay rates, the spectrum calculated with the variance method can have negative values. This is obviously unphysical result since the fluorescence spectrum is a positively defined quantity. It represents the frequency distribution of light incoherently scattered by the atomic system. Therefore, the calculated spectrum should be positive for all frequencies independent of values of the Rabi frequencies and the damping rates. In this comment, we show that there are no discrepancies between these two methods. The equivalence of these two alternative methods leads to the same incoherent spectra that are positive for all frequencies independent of values of the parameters involved. The analytical analysis is supported by simple numerical calculations. 
0808.03433	How many species have mass M?	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:Aaron Clauset, David J. Schwab, Sidney Redner	Abstract:  Within large taxonomic assemblages, the number of species with adult body mass M is characterized by a broad but asymmetric distribution, with the largest mass being orders of magnitude larger than the typical mass. This canonical shape can be explained by cladogenetic diffusion that is bounded below by a hard limit on viable species mass and above by extinction risks that increase weakly with mass. Here we introduce and analytically solve a simplified cladogenetic diffusion model. When appropriately parameterized, the diffusion-reaction equation predicts mass distributions that are in good agreement with data on 4002 terrestrial mammal from the late Quaternary and 8617 extant bird species. Under this model, we show that a specific tradeoff between the strength of within-lineage drift toward larger masses (Cope's rule) and the increased risk of extinction from increased mass is necessary to produce realistic mass distributions for both taxa. We then make several predictions about the evolution of avian species masses. 
0808.03434	Two-photon photoassociative spectroscopy of ultracold 88-Sr	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:Y. N. Martinez de Escobar, P. G. Mickelson, P. Pellegrini, S. B. Nagel, A. Traverso, M. Yan, R. Cote, T. C. Killian	Abstract:  We present results from two-photon photoassociative spectroscopy of the least-bound vibrational level of the X$^1Σ_g^+$ state of the $^{88}$Sr$_2$ dimer. Measurement of the binding energy allows us to determine the s-wave scattering length, $a_{88}=-1.4(6) a_0$. For the intermediate state, we use a bound level on the metastable $^1S_0$-$^3P_1$ potential, which provides large Franck-Condon transition factors and narrow one-photon photoassociative lines that are advantageous for observing quantum-optical effects such as Autler-Townes resonance splittings. 
0808.03435	Symmetry operators and separability of massive Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations in the general 5-dimensional Kerr-(anti-)de Sitter black hole background	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Shuang-Qing Wu	Abstract:  It is shown that the Dirac equation is separable by variables in a five-dimensional rotating Kerr-(anti-)de Sitter black hole with two independent angular momenta. A first order symmetry operator that commutes with the Dirac operator is constructed in terms of a rank-three Killing-Yano tensor whose square is a second order symmetric Stackel-Killing tensor admitted by the five-dimensional Kerr-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime. We highlight the construction procedure of such a symmetry operator. In addition, the first law of black hole thermodynamics has been extended to the case that the cosmological constant can be viewed as a thermodynamical variable. 
0808.03436	Suzaku Observation of HESS J1825-137: Discovery of Largely-Extended X-rays near from PSR J1826-1334	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:H. Uchiyama, H. Matsumoto, T. G. Tsuru, K. Koyama, A. Bamba	Abstract:  We observed the brightest part of HESS J1825-137 with the Suzaku XIS, and found diffuse X-rays extending at least up to 15' (~ 17 pc) from the pulsar PSR J1826-1334. The spectra have no emission line, and are fitted with an absorbed power-law model. The X-rays, therefore, are likely due to synchrotron emission from a pulsar wind nebula. The photon index near at the pulsar (r<1.5') is 1.7 while those in r=1.5-16 are nearly constant at Gamma=2.0. The spectral energy distribution of the Suzaku and H.E.S.S. results are naturally explained by a combined process; synchrotron X-rays and gamma-rays by the inverse Compton of the cosmic microwave photons by high-energy electrons in a magnetic field of 7 micro G. If the electrons are accelerated at the pulsar, the electrons must be transported over 17 pc in the synchrotron life time of 1900 yr, with a velocity of > 8.8 times 10^3 km s^{-1}. 
0808.03437	Dissipative solitons stabilized by a quantum Zeno-like effect	Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)	Authors:Hong-Gang Luo, Dun Zhao, Xu-Gang He, Lin Li	Abstract:  An unstable particle in quantum mechanics can be stabilized by frequent measurements, known as the quantum Zeno effect. A soliton with dissipation behaves like an unstable particle. Similar to the quantum Zeno effect, here we show that the soliton can be stabilized by modulating periodically dispersion, nonlinearity, or the external harmonic potential available in BEC. This can be obtained by analyzing a Painleve integrability condition, which results from the rigorous Painleve analysis of the generalized nonautonomous nonlinear Schrodinger equation. The result has a profound implication to the optical soliton transmission and the matter-wave soliton dynamics. 
0808.03438	A mathematical proof that the transition to a superconducting state is a second-order phase transition	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Shuji Watanabe	Abstract:  We deal with the gap function and the thermodynamical potential in the BCS-Bogoliubov theory of superconductivity, where the gap function is a function of the temperature $T$ only. We show that the squared gap function is of class $C^2$ on the closed interval $[ 0, T_c ]$ and point out some more properties of the gap function. Here, $T_c$ stands for the transition temperature. On the basis of this study we then give, examining the thermodynamical potential, a mathematical proof that the transition to a superconducting state is a second-order phase transition. Furthermore, we obtain a new and more precise form of the gap in the specific heat at constant volume from a mathematical point of view. 
0808.03439	Combinatorial bases for multilinear parts of free algebras with double compatible brackets	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Fu Liu	Abstract:  Let X be an ordered alphabet. Lie_2(n) (and P_2(n) respectively) are the multilinear parts of the free Lie algebra (and the free Poisson algebra respectively) on X with a pair of compatible Lie brackets. In this paper, we prove the dimension formulas for these two algebras conjectured by B. Feigin by constructing bases for Lie_2(n) (and P_2(n)) from combinatorial objects. We also define a complementary space Eil_2(n) to Lie_2(n), give a pairing between Lie_2(n) and Eil_2(n), and show that the pairing is perfect. 
0808.03440	The Hall conductance, topological quantum phase transition and the Diophantine equation on honeycomb lattice	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Masatoshi Sato, Daijiro Tobe, Mahito Kohmoto	Abstract:  We consider a tight-binding model with the nearest neighbour hopping integrals on the honeycomb lattice in a magnetic field. Assuming one of the three hopping integrals, which we denote t_a, can take a different value from the two others, we study quantum phase structures controlled by the anisotropy of the honeycomb lattice.For weak and strong t_a regions, respectively, the Hall conductances are calculated algebraically by using the Diophantine equation. Except for a few specific gaps, we completely determine the Hall conductances in these two regions including those for subband gaps. In a weak magnetic field, it is found that the weak t_a region shows the unconventional quantization of the Hall conductance, σ_{xy}=-(e^2/h)(2n+1), (n=0,\pm 1,\pm 2,...), near the half-filling, while the strong t_a region shows only the conventional one, σ_{xy}=-(e^2/h)n,(n=0,1,2,...). From topological nature of the Hall conductance, the existence of gap closing points and quantum phase transitions in the intermediate t_a region are concluded. We also study numerically the quantum phase structure in detail, and find that even when t_a=1, namely in graphene case, the system is in the weak t_a phase except when the Fermi energy is located near the van Hove singularity or the lower and upper edges of the spectrum. 
0808.03441	The latent potential of YouTube - Will it become the 21st Century lecturer's film archive?	Physics Education (physics.ed-ph)	Authors:A.P. Micolich	Abstract:  YouTube (this http URL) is an online, public-access video-sharing site that allows users to post short streaming-video submissions for open viewing. Along with Google, MySpace, Facebook, etc. it is one of the great success stories of the Internet, and is widely used by many of today's undergraduate students. The higher education sector has recently realised the potential of YouTube for presenting teaching resources/material to students, and publicising research. This article considers another potential use for online video archiving websites such as YouTube and GoogleVideo in higher education - as an online video archive providing thousands of hours of video footage for use in lectures. In this article I will discuss why this might be useful, present some examples that demonstrate the potential for YouTube as a teaching resource, and highlight some of the copyright and legal issues that currently impact on the effective use of new online video websites, such as YouTube, for use as a teaching resource. 
0808.03442	Generalizing the Tomboulis-Yaffe Inequality to SU(N) Lattice Gauge Theories and General Classical Spin Systems	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Takuya Kanazawa	Abstract:  We extend the inequality of Tomboulis and Yaffe in SU(2) lattice gauge theory (LGT) to SU(N) LGT and to general classical spin systems, by use of reflection positivity. Basically the inequalities guarantee that a system in a box that is sufficiently insensitive to boundary conditions has a non-zero mass gap. We explicitly illustrate the theorem in some solvable models. Strong coupling expansion is then utilized to discuss some aspects of the theorem. Finally a conjecture for exact expression to the off-axis mass gap of the triangular Ising model is presented. The validity of the conjecture is tested in multiple ways.

With the SMA data, we have detected and mapped the transitions in the CH$_{3}$CN, CO, $^{13}$CO, SO$_{2}$, OCS, and CH$_{3}$OH molecular lines as well as the radio recombination line H30$α$. The observations and analysis indicate a hot core associated with G28.20-0.04N. The outflow and possible rotation are detected in this region. 
0808.03444	Massive Yang-Mills Fields in Interaction with Gravity	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:D. R. Grigore, G. Scharf	Abstract:  We determine the most general form of the interaction between the gravitational field and an arbitrary Yang-Mills system of fields (massless and massive). We work in the perturbative quantum framework of the causal approach (of Epstein and Glaser) and use a cohomological definition of gauge invariance for both gauge fields. We also consider the case of massive gravity. We discuss the question whether gravity couples to the unphysical degrees of freedom in the Yang-Mills fields. 
0808.03445	Displacement-noise-free resonant speed meter for gravitational-wave detection	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Sergey P. Vyatchanin	Abstract:  We demonstrate that speedmeter, based on double pumped resonant Sagnac interferometer, can be used as a displacement noise free gravitational-wave (GW) detector. The displacement noise of cavity mirrors can be completely excluded through a proper linear combination of the output signals. We show that in low-frequency region the obtained displacement-noise-free response signal is stronger than the one in previously proposed displacement noise free interferometers. 
0808.03446	Dynamical pinning of domain wall in magnetic nanowire induced by Walker breakdown	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Hironobu Tanigawa, Tomohiro Koyama, Maciej Bartkowiak, Shinya Kasai, Kensuke Kobayashi, Yoshinobu Nakatani, Teruo Ono	Abstract:  Transmission probability of a domain wall through a magnetic nanowire is investigated as a function of the external magnetic field. Very intriguing phenomenon is found that the transmission probability shows a significant drop after exceeding the threshold driving field, which contradicts our intuition that a domain wall is more mobile in the higher magnetic field. The micromagnetics simulation reveals that the domain wall motion in the wire with finite roughness causes the dynamical pinning due to the Walker breakdown, which semi-quantitatively explains our experimental results. 
0808.03447	Riesz basis for strongly continuous groups	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Hans Zwart	Abstract:  Given a Hilbert space and the generator of a strongly continuous group on this Hilbert space. If the eigenvalues of the generator have a uniform gap, and if the span of the corresponding eigenvectors is dense, then these eigenvectors form a Riesz basis (or unconditional basis) of the Hilbert space. Furthermore, we show that none of the conditions can be weakened. However, if the eigenvalues (counted with multiplicity) can be grouped into subsets of at most $K$ elements, and the distance between the groups is (uniformly) bounded away from zero, then the spectral projections associated to the groups form a Riesz family. This implies that if in every range of the spectral projection we construct an orthonormal basis, then the union of these bases is a Riesz basis in the Hilbert space. 
0808.03448	The Hydrodynamics of Gamma-Ray Burst Remnants	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, Andrew I. MacFadyen	Abstract:  This paper reports on the results of a numerical investigation designed to address how the initially anisotropic appearance of a GRB remnant is modified by the character of the circumburst medium and by the possible presence of an accompanying supernova (SN). Axisymmetric hydrodynamical calculations of light, impulsive jets propagating in both uniform and inhomogeneous external media are presented, which show that the resulting dynamics of their remnants since the onset of the non-relativistic phase is different from the standard self-similar solutions. Because massive star progenitors are expected to have their close-in surroundings modified by the progenitor winds, we consider both free winds and shocked winds as possible external media for GRB remnant evolution. Abundant confirmation is provided here of the important notion that the morphology and visibility of GRB remnants are determined largely by their circumstellar environments. For this reason, their detectability is highly biased in favor of those with massive star progenitors; although, in this class of models, the beamed component may be difficult to identify because the GRB ejecta is eventually swept up by the accompanying SN. The number density of asymmetric GRB remnants in the local Universe could be, however, far larger if they expand in a tenuous interstellar medium, as expected for some short GRB progenitor models. In these sources, the late size of the observable, asymmetric remnant could extend over a wide, possibly resolvable angle and may be easier to constrain directly. 
0808.03449	Halo density reduction by baryonic settling?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. R. Jardel, J. A. Sellwood (Rutgers University)    	Abstract:  We test the proposal by El-Zant et al that the dark matter density of halos could be reduced through dynamical friction acting on heavy baryonic clumps in the early stages of galaxy formation. Using N-body simulations, we confirm that the inner halo density cusp is flattened to 0.2 of the halo break radius by the settling of a single clump of mass \ga 0.5% of the halo mass. We also find that an ensemble of 50 clumps each having masses \ga 0.2% can flatten the cusp to almost the halo break radius on a time scale of \sim9 Gyr, for an NFW halo of concentration 15. We summarize some of the difficulties that need to be overcome if this mechanism is to resolve the apparent conflict between the observed inner densities of galaxy halos and the predictions of LCDM. 
0808.03450	Generalized eigenfunctions of relativistic Schroedinger operators in two dimensions	Spectral Theory (math.SP)	Authors:Tomio Umeda (University of Hyogo), Dabi Wei (Tokyo Institute of Technology)    	Abstract:  Generalized eigenfunctions of the two-dimensional relativistic Schrödinger operator $H=\sqrt{-Δ}+V(x)$ with $|V(x)|\leq C< x>^{-σ}$, $σ>3/2$, are considered. We compute the integral kernels of the boundary values $R_0^\pm(λ)=(\sqrt{-Δ}-(λ\pm i0))^{-1}$, and prove that the generalized eigenfunctions $φ^\pm(x,k)$ are bounded on $R_x^2\times\{k | a\leq |k|\leq b\}$, where $[a,b]\subset(0,\infty)\backslashσ_p(H)$, and $σ_p(H)$ is the set of eigenvalues of $H$. With this fact and the completeness of the wave operators, we establish the eigenfunction expansion for the absolutely continuous subspace for $H$. Finally, we show that each generalized eigenfunction is asymptotically equal to a sum of a plane wave and a spherical wave under the assumption that $σ>2$. 
0808.03451	The X-ray luminosity of solar-mass stars in the intermediate age open cluster NGC 752	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:G. Giardino (1), I. Pillitteri (2), F. Favata (3), G. Micela (4) ((1) ESA - Research and Science Support Department, (2) DSFA, Universita' di Palermo, (3) ESA - Planning and Community Coordination Office, (4) INAF - Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo)    	Abstract:  AIMS. While observational evidence shows that most of the decline in a star's X-ray activity occurs between the age of the Hyades (~8 x 10^8 yrs) and that of the Sun, very little is known about the evolution of stellar activity between these ages. To gain information on the typical level of coronal activity at a star's intermediate age, we studied the X-ray emission from stars in the 1.9 Gyr old open cluster NGC 752. METHODS. We analysed a ~140 ks Chandra observation of NGC 752 and a ~50 ks XMM-Newton observation of the same cluster. We detected 262 X-ray sources in the Chandra data and 145 sources in the XMM-Newton observation. Around 90% of the catalogued cluster members within Chandra's field-of-view are detected in the X-ray. The X-ray luminosity of all observed cluster members (28 stars) and of 11 cluster member candidates was derived. RESULTS. Our data indicate that, at an age of 1.9 Gyr, the typical X-ray luminosity of the cluster members with M=0.8-1.2 Msun is Lx = 1.3 x 10^28 erg s^-1, so approximately a factor of 6 less intense than that observed in the younger Hyades. Given that Lx is proportional to the square of a star's rotational rate, the median Lx of NGC 752 is consistent, for t > 1 Gyr, to a decaying rate in rotational velocities v_rot ~ t^-alpha with alpha ~ 0.75, steeper than the Skumanich relation (alpha ~ 0.5) and significantly steeper than observed between the Pleiades and the Hyades (where alpha < 0.3), suggesting that a change in the rotational regimes of the stellar interiors is taking place at t ~ 1 Gyr. 
0808.03452	Tropical enumerative invariants of F_0 and F_2	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Marina Franz, Hannah Markwig	Abstract:  There is an equation relating numbers of curves on F_0 satisfying incidence conditions and numbers of curves on F_2 satisfying incidence conditions. The purpose of this paper is to give a tropical proof of this equation in the case of rational curves. We use induction on the degree and two Kontsevich-type formulas for curves on F_0 and on F_2. The formula for F_2 was not known before and is proved using tropical geometry. 
0808.03453	Codes on hypergraphs	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Alexander Barg, Arya Mazumdar, Gilles Zémor	Abstract:  Codes on hypergraphs are an extension of the well-studied family of codes on bipartite graphs. Bilu and Hoory (2004) constructed an explicit family of codes on regular t-partite hypergraphs whose minimum distance improves earlier estimates of the distance of bipartite-graph codes. They also suggested a decoding algorithm for such codes and estimated its error-correcting capability. In this paper we study two aspects of hypergraph codes. First, we compute the weight enumerators of several ensembles of such codes, establishing conditions under which they attain the Gilbert-Varshamov bound and deriving estimates of their distance. In particular, we show that this bound is attained by codes constructed on a fixed bipartite graph with a large spectral gap. We also suggest a new decoding algorithm of hypergraph codes that corrects a constant fraction of errors, improving upon the algorithm of Bilu and Hoory.

0808.03455	Influence of zonal flows on unstable drift modes in ETG turbulence	Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)	Authors:V. M. Lashkin, Yu. A. Zaliznyak, A. I. Yakimenko	Abstract:  The linear instability of the electron temperature gradient (ETG) driven modes in the presence of zonal flows is investigated. Random and deterministic $cos$ - like profiles of the zonal flow are considered. It is shown that the presence of shearing by zonal flows can stabilize the linear instability of ETG drift modes. 
0808.03456	Influence of the mean flow on zonal flow generation	Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)	Authors:V. M. Lashkin	Abstract:  Excitation of zonal flow by the modulational instability in the presence of mean shear flow is considered. It is shown that the small amplitude mean flow favours the modulational instability, increasing the growth rate, whereas sufficiently strong mean shear significantly reduces the instability growth rate. 
0808.03457	A model comparison of resonance lifetime modifications, a soft equation of state and non-Gaussian effects on $π-π$ correlations at FAIR/AGS energies	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Qingfeng Li, Marcus Bleicher	Abstract:  HBT correlations of $π^--π^-$ pairs at FAIR/AGS energies are investigated by using the UrQMD transport model and the CRAB analyzing program. Three different possible sources (treatment of resonance lifetimes, a soft equation of state and non-Gaussian effects) to understand the HBT $R_O/R_S$ puzzle are investigated. Firstly, we find that different treatments of the resonance decay time can not resolve the HBT time-related puzzle, however it can modify the HBT radii at low transverse momenta to some extent to explain the data slightly. Secondly, with a soft equation of state with momentum dependence, the measured transverse momentum dependent HBT radii and $R_O/R_S$ ratio can be described fairly well. Thirdly, non-Gaussian effects are visible in the calculated correlation function. Using the Edgeworth expansion, one finds that the non-Gaussian effect is strongest in the longitudinal direction and weakest in the sideward direction. 
0808.03458	A central limit theorem for the rescaled Lévy area of two-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H<1/4$	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Jeremie Unterberger	Abstract:  Let $B=(B^{(1)},B^{(2)})$ be a two-dimensional fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $α\in (0,1/4)$. Using an analytic approximation $B(η)$ of $B$ introduced in \cite{Unt08}, we prove that the rescaled Lévy area process $(s,t)\to η^{\half(1-4α)}\int_s^t dB_{t_1}^{(1)}(η) \int_s^{t_1} dB_{t_2}^{(2)}(η)$ converges in law to $W_t-W_s$ where $W$ is a Brownian motion independent from $B$. The method relies on a very general scheme of analysis of singularities of analytic functions, applied to the moments of finite-dimensional distributions of the Lévy area. 
0808.03459	Noncommutative Deformations of Wightman Quantum Field Theories	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Harald Grosse, Gandalf Lechner	Abstract:  Quantum field theories on noncommutative Minkowski space are studied in a model-independent setting by treating the noncommutativity as a deformation of quantum field theories on commutative space. Starting from an arbitrary Wightman theory, we consider special vacuum representations of its Weyl-Wigner deformed counterpart. In such representations, the effect of the noncommutativity on the basic structures of Wightman theory, in particular the covariance, locality and regularity properties of the fields, the structure of the Wightman functions, and the commutative limit, is analyzed. Despite the nonlocal structure introduced by the noncommutativity, the deformed quantum fields can still be localized in certain wedge-shaped regions, and may therefore be used to compute noncommutative corrections to two-particle S-matrix elements. 
0808.03460	First-principles investigation of effect of pressure on BaFe$_2$As$_2$	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Wenhui Xie, Mingli Bao, Zhenjie Zhao, Bang-Gui Liu	Abstract:  On experimental side, BaFe$_2$As$_2$ without doping has been made superconducting by applying appropriate pressure (2-6 GPa). Here, we use a full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method within the density-functional theory to investigate the effect of pressure on its crystal structure, magnetic order, and electronic structure. Our calculations show that the striped antiferromagnetic order observed in experiment is stable against pressure up to 13 GPa. Calculated antiferromagnetic lattice parameters are in good agreements with experimental data, while calculations with nonmagnetic state underestimate Fe-As bond length and c-axis lattice constant. The effects of pressure on crystal structure and electronic structure are investigated for both the antiferromagnetic state and the nonmagnetic one. We find that the compressibility of the antiferromagnetic state is quite isotropic up to about 6.4 GPa. With increasing pressure, the FeAs$_4$ tetrahedra is hardly distorted. We observe a transition of Fermi surface topology in the striped antiferromagnetic state when the compression of volume is beyond 8% (or pressure 6 GPa), which corresponds to a large change of $c/a$ ratio. These first-principles results should be useful to understanding the antiferromagnetism and electronic states in the FeAs-based materials, and may have some useful implications to the superconductivity. 
0808.03461	BV photometry of a possible open star cluster pair NGC 7031/NGC 7086	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Valentin Kopchev, Georgy Petrov	Abstract:  We present a CCD BV photometry of the possible binary open star cluster NGC 7031/NGC 7086. The aim is to confirm or disprove their common nature on the grounds of their age and distance. An age of 224 $\pm$ 25 Myr and distance 831 $\pm$ 72 pc was determined for NGC 7031 and 178 $\pm$ 25 Myr, 955 $\pm$ 84 pc for NGC 7086, respectively. Based on these differences in age and distance we conclude that the two clusters are most likely not formed together from one and the same Giant Molecular Cloud and thus are not a true binary cluster. 
0808.03462	An oscillating, homogeneous and isotropic Universe from Scalar-Tensor gravity	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Christian Corda	Abstract:  An oscillating, homogeneous and isotropic Universe which arises from Scalar-Tensor gravity is discussed in the linearized approach, showing that some observative evidences like the Hubble Law and the Cosmological Redshift are in agreement with the model. In this context Dark Energy appears like a pure curvature effect arising by the scalar field. 
0808.03463	Contact mechanics with adhesion: Interfacial separation and contact area	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:C. Yang, B.N.J. Persson, J. Israelachvili, K. Rosenberg	Abstract:  We study the adhesive contact between elastic solids with randomly rough, self affine fractal surfaces. We present molecular dynamics (MD) simulation results for the interfacial stress distribution and the wall-wall separation. We compare the MD results for the relative contact area and the average interfacial separation, with the prediction of the contact mechanics theory of Persson. We find good agreement between theory and the simulation results. We apply the theory to the system studied by Benz et al. involving polymer in contact with polymer, but in this case the adhesion gives only a small modification of the interfacial separation as a function of the squeezing pressure. 
0808.03464	Long-term AGILE monitoring of the puzzling gamma-ray source 3EG J1835+5918	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Bulgarelli, M. Tavani, P. Caraveo, A.W. Chen, F. Gianotti, M. Trifoglio, M. Marelli, A. Argan, G. Barbiellini, F. Boffelli, P. W. Cattaneo, V. Cocco, E. Costa, F. D'Ammando, E. Del Monte, G. De Paris, G. Di Cocco, I. Donnarumma, Y. Evangelista, M. Feroci, M. Fiorini, T. Froysland, F. Fuschino, M. Galli, A. Giuliani, C. Labanti, I. Lapshov, F. Lazzarotto, P. Lipari, F. Longo, M. Marisaldi, S. Mereghetti, A. Morselli, L. Pacciani, A. Pellizzoni, F. Perotti, G. Piano, P. Picozza, M. Prest, G. Pucella, M. Rapisarda, A. Rappoldi, P. Soffitta, A. Trois, E. Vallazza, S. Vercellone, V. Vittorini, A. Zambra, D. Zanello, P. Giommi, C. Pittoril, F. Verrecchia, P. Santolamazza, D. Gasparrini, S. Cutini, S. Colafrancesco, L. Salotti	Abstract:  We present the AGILE gamma-ray observations of the field containing the puzzling gamma-ray source 3EG J1835+5918. This source is one of the most remarkable unidentified EGRET sources. An unprecedentedly long AGILE monitoring of this source yields important information on the positional error box, flux evolution, and spectrum. 3EG J1835+5918 has been in the AGILE field of view several times in 2007 and 2008 for a total observing time of 138 days from 2007 Sept 04 to 2008 June 30 encompassing several weeks of continuous coverage. With an exposure time approximately twice that of EGRET, AGILE confirms the existence of a prominent gamma-ray source (AGL J1836+5926) at a position consistent with that of EGRET, although with a remarkably lower average flux value for photon energies greater than 100 MeV. A 5-day bin temporal analysis of the whole data set of AGL J1836+5926 shows some evidence for variability of the gamma-ray flux. The source spectrum between 100 MeV and 1 GeV can be fitted with a power law with photon index in the range 1.6-1.7, fully consistent with the EGRET value. The faint X-ray source RX J1836.2+5925 that has been proposed as a possible counterpart of 3EG J1835+5918 is well within the AGILE error box. Future continuous monitoring (both by AGILE and GLAST) is needed to confirm the gamma-ray flux variability and to unveil the source origin, a subject that is currently being pursued through a multiwavelength search for counterparts. 
0808.03465	Achieving the threshold regime with an over-screened Josephson junction	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Eugene V. Sukhorukov, Andrew N. Jordan	Abstract:  We demonstrate that by utilizing an over-screened Josephson junction as a noise detector it is possible to achieve the threshold regime, whereby the tails of the fluctuating current distribution are measured. This situation is realized by placing the Josephson junction and mesoscopic conductor in an external circuit with very low impedance. In the underdamped limit, over-screening the junction inhibits the energy diffusion in the junction, effectively creating a tunable activation barrier to the dissipative state. As a result, the activation rate is qualitatively different from the Arrhenius form. 
0808.03466	On sequential Monte Carlo, partial rejection control and approximate Bayesian computation	Computation (stat.CO)	Authors:G. W. Peters, Y. Fan, S. A. Sisson	Abstract:  We present a sequential Monte Carlo sampler variant of the partial rejection control algorithm, and show that this variant can be considered as a sequential Monte Carlo sampler with a modified mutation kernel. We prove that the new sampler can reduce the variance of the incremental importance weights when compared with standard sequential Monte Carlo samplers. We provide a study of theoretical properties of the new algorithm, and make connections with some existing algorithms. Finally, the sampler is adapted for application under the challenging "likelihood free," approximate Bayesian computation modelling framework, where we demonstrate superior performance over existing likelihood-free samplers. 
0808.03467	Generalized mean curvature flow in Carnot groups	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Luca Capogna, Giovanna Citti	Abstract:  In this paper we study the generalized mean curvature flow of sets in the sub-Riemannian geometry of Carnot groups. We extend to our context the level sets method and the weak (viscosity) solutions introduced in the Euclidean setting by Evans-Spruck and Chen-Giga-Goto. We establish two special cases of the comparison principle, existence, uniqueness and basic geometric properties of the flow. 
0808.03468	Stable three-dimensional spatially modulated vortex solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates	Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)	Authors:V. M. Lashkin	Abstract:  We present exact numerical solutions in the form of spatially localized three-dimensional (3D) nonrotating and rotating (azimuthon) multipole solitons in the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) confined by a parabolic trap. We numerically show that the 3D azimuthon solutions exist as a continuous family parametrized by the angular velocity (or, equivalently, the modulational depth). By a linear stability analysis we show that 3D azimuthons with a sufficiently large phase modulational depth can be stable. The results are confirmed by direct numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. 
0808.03469	Theoretical prediction and experimental study of a ferromagnetic shape memory alloy: Ga_2MnNi	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:S. R. Barman, Aparna Chakrabarti, Sanjay Singh, S. Banik, S. Bhardwaj, P. L. Paulose, B. A. Chalke, A. K. Panda, A. Mitra, A. M. Awasthi	Abstract:  We predict the existence of a new ferromagnetic shape memory alloy Ga_2MnNi using density functional theory. The martensitic start temperature (T_M) is found to be approximately proportional to the stabilization energy of the martensitic phase (deltaE_tot) for different shape memory alloys. Experimental studies performed to verify the theoretical results show that Ga_2MnNi is ferromagnetic at room temperature and the T_M and T_C are 780K and 330K, respectively. Both from theory and experiment, the martensitic transition is found to be volume conserving that is indicative of shape memory behavior. 
0808.03470	Weighted power counting and Lorentz violating gauge theories. I: General properties	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Damiano Anselmi	Abstract:  We construct local, unitary gauge theories that violate Lorentz symmetry explicitly at high energies and are renormalizable by weighted power counting. They contain higher space derivatives, which improve the behavior of propagators at large momenta, but no higher time derivatives. We show that the regularity of the gauge-field propagator privileges a particular spacetime breaking, the one into into space and time. We then concentrate on the simplest class of models, study four dimensional examples and discuss a number of issues that arise in our approach, such as the low-energy recovery of Lorentz invariance. 
0808.03471	Dijet azimuthal distributions and initial-state parton showers	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:F.Hautmann, H.Jung	Abstract:  We investigate angular correlations in multi-jet final states at high-energy colliders and discuss their sensitivity to initial-state showering effects, including QCD coherence and corrections to collinear ordering. 
0808.03472	Nonlinear regularization techniques for seismic tomography	Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)	Authors:I. Loris, H. Douma, G. Nolet, I. Daubechies, C. Regone	Abstract:  The effects of several nonlinear regularization techniques are discussed in the framework of 3D seismic tomography. Traditional, linear, $\ell_2$ penalties are compared to so-called sparsity promoting $\ell_1$ and $\ell_0$ penalties, and a total variation penalty. Which of these algorithms is judged optimal depends on the specific requirements of the scientific experiment. If the correct reproduction of model amplitudes is important, classical damping towards a smooth model using an $\ell_2$ norm works almost as well as minimizing the total variation but is much more efficient. If gradients (edges of anomalies) should be resolved with a minimum of distortion, we prefer $\ell_1$ damping of Daubechies-4 wavelet coefficients. It has the additional advantage of yielding a noiseless reconstruction, contrary to simple $\ell_2$ minimization (`Tikhonov regularization') which should be avoided. In some of our examples, the $\ell_0$ method produced notable artifacts. In addition we show how nonlinear $\ell_1$ methods for finding sparse models can be competitive in speed with the widely used $\ell_2$ methods, certainly under noisy conditions, so that there is no need to shun $\ell_1$ penalizations. 
0808.03473	Impurity suppression of the critical temperature in the iron-based superconductors	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Yunkyu Bang, Han-Yong Choi, Hyekyung Won	Abstract:  We study the impurity suppression of the critical temperature $T_c$ of the FeAs superconductors theoretically based on the the $\pm$s-wave pairing state of a two band model. The effects of non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are studied with the $\mathcal{T}$-matrix approximation, which can continuously treat impurity scattering from weak to strong coupling limit. We found that both magnetic and non-magnetic impurities suppress $T_c$ with a rate that is practically indistinguishable from the standard d-wave case despite a possibly large difference of the positive and negative s-wave order parameter (OP) magnitudes. This is because the density of states enters together with the OP magnitude for the scattering process. 
0808.03474	Weighted power counting and Lorentz violating gauge theories. II: Classification	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Damiano Anselmi	Abstract:  We classify the local, polynomial, unitary gauge theories that violate Lorentz symmetry explicitly at high energies and are renormalizable by weighted power counting. We study the structure of such theories and prove that renormalization does not generate higher time derivatives. We work out the conditions to renormalize vertices that are usually non-renormalizable, such as the two scalar-two fermion interactions and the four fermion interactions. A number of four dimensional examples are presented. 
0808.03475	Weighted power counting, neutrino masses and Lorentz violating extensions of the Standard Model	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Damiano Anselmi	Abstract:  We study the Standard-Model extensions that have the following features: they violate Lorentz invariance explicitly at high energies; they are unitary, local, polynomial and renormalizable by weighted power counting; they contain the vertex (LH)^2, which gives Majorana masses to the neutrinos after symmetry breaking, and possibly four fermion interactions; they do not contain right-handed neutrinos, nor other extra fields. We study the simplest CPT invariant Standard-Model extension of this type in detail and prove the cancellation of gauge anomalies. We investigate the low-energy recovery of Lorentz invariance and comment on other types of extensions. 
0808.03476	Constraints from deuterium on the formation of icy bodies in the Jovian system and beyond	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jonathan Horner, Olivier Mousis, Yann Alibert, Jonathan I. Lunine, Michel Blanc	Abstract:  We consider the role of deuterium as a potential marker of location and ambient conditions during the formation of small bodies in our Solar system. We concentrate in particular on the formation of the regular icy satellites of Jupiter and the other giant planets, but include a discussion of the implications for the Trojan asteroids and the irregular satellites. We examine in detail the formation of regular planetary satellites within the paradigm of a circum-Jovian subnebula. Particular attention is paid to the two extreme potential subnebulae - "hot" and "cold". In particular, we show that, for the case of the "hot" subnebula model, the D:H ratio in water ice measured from the regular satellites would be expected to be near-Solar. In contrast, satellites which formed in a "cold" subnebula would be expected to display a D:H ratio that is distinctly over-Solar. We then compare the results obtained with the enrichment regimes which could be expected for other families of icy small bodies in the outer Solar system - the Trojan asteroids and the irregular satellites. In doing so, we demonstrate how measurements by Laplace, the James Webb Space Telescope, HERSCHEL and ALMA will play an important role in determining the true formation locations and mechanisms of these objects. 
0808.03477	Beam Performance of Tracking Detectors with Industrially Produced GEM Foils	Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)	Authors:Frank Simon, James Kelsey, Michael Kohl, Richard Majka, Miro Plesko, Tai Sakuma, Nikolai Smirnov, Harold Spinka, Bernd Surrow, David Underwood	Abstract:  Three Gas-Electron-Multiplier tracking detectors with an active area of 10 cm x 10 cm and a two-dimensional, laser-etched orthogonal strip readout have been tested extensively in particle beams at the Meson Test Beam Facility at Fermilab. These detectors used GEM foils produced by Tech-Etch, Inc. They showed an efficiency in excess of 95% and spatial resolution better than 70 um. The influence of the angle of incidence of particles on efficiency and spatial resolution was studied in detail. 
0808.03478	Scaling laws and higher-order effects in Coulomb excitation of neutron halo nuclei	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:S.Typel, G.Baur	Abstract:  Essential properties of halo nuclei can be described in terms of a few low-energy constants. For neutron halo nuclei, analytical results can be found for wave functions and electromagnetic transition matrix-elements in simple but well-adapted models. These wave functions can be used to study nuclear reactions; an especially simple and instructive example is Coulomb excitation. A systematic expansion in terms of small parameters can be given. We present scaling laws for excitation amplitudes and cross sections. The results can be used to analyze experiments like ${}^{11}$Be Coulomb excitation. They also serve as benchmark tests for more involved reaction theories. 
0808.03479	Does Charge Contribute to the Frame Dragging of Spacetime?	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Babur M. Mirza	Abstract:  Electrically charged systems bound by a strong gravitational force can sustain a huge amount of electric charge (up to 10^20C) against Coulomb repulsion. General relativistically such systems form a stable hydrostatic configuration both in the non-rotating and rotating cases. Here we study the effects of electric charge (electric energy density) on the spacetime outside a rotating electrically charged system bound by a strong gravitational force. In particular we investigate the effect of charge density on frame-dragging of spacetime in the exterior region. Using the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations it is found that in the slow rotation approximation charge accumulations not only acts like an additional mass, thus modifying the spherically symmetric part of the spacetime, the electric charge also contributes directly to the dragging of spacetime. A modified Lense-Thirring formula for the spacetime frame dragging frequency is obtained. 
0808.03480	Temporal behaviour of global perturbations in compressible axisymmetric flows with free boundaries	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:V.V. Zhuravlev, N.I. Shakura	Abstract:  The dynamics of small global perturbations in the form of linear combination of a finite number of non-axisymmetric eigenmodes is studied in two-dimensional approximation. The background flow is assumed to be an axisymmetric perfect fluid with the adiabatic index $γ=5/3$ rotating with power law angular velocity distribution $Ω\propto r^{-q}$, $1.5<q<2.0$, confined by free boundaries in the radial direction. The substantial transient growth of acoustic energy of optimized perturbations is discovered. An optimal energy growth $G$ is calculated numerically for a variety of parameters. Its value depends essentially on the perturbation azimuthal wavenumber $m$ and increases for higher values of $m$. The closer the rotation profile to the Keplerian law, the larger growth factors can be obtained but over a longer time. The highest acoustic energy increase found numerically is of order $\sim 10^2$ over $\sim 6$ typical Keplerian periods. Slow neutral eigenmodes with corotation radius beyond the outer boundary mostly contribute to the transient growth. The revealed linear temporal behaviour of perturbations may play an important role in angular momentum transfer in toroidal flows near compact relativistic objects. 
0808.03481	Monte-Carlo-Simulations of Stochastic Differential Equations at the Example of the Forced Burgers' Equation	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:D. Homeier, K. Jansen, D. Mesterhazy, C. Urbach	Abstract:  We investigate the behaviour of stochastic differential equations, especially Burgers' eq., by means of Monte-Carlo-techniques. 
0808.03482	Dynamics of interacting dark energy model in Einstein and Loop Quantum Cosmology	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Songbai Chen, Bin Wang, Jiliang Jing	Abstract:  We investigate the background dynamics when dark energy is coupled to dark matter in the universe described by Einstein cosmology and Loop Quantum Cosmology. We introduce a new general form of dark sector coupling, which presents us a more complicated dynamical phase space. Differences in the phase space in obtaining the accelerated scaling attractor in Einstein cosmology and Loop Quantum Cosmology are disclosed. 
0808.03483	Conserving approximations in time-dependent quantum transport: Initial correlations and memory effects	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Petri Myöhänen, Adrian Stan, Gianluca Stefanucci, Robert van Leeuwen	Abstract:  We study time-dependent quantum transport in a correlated model system by means of time-propagation of the Kadanoff-Baym equations for the nonequilibrium many-body Green function. We consider an initially contacted equilibrium system of a correlated central region coupled to tight-binding leads. Subsequently a time-dependent bias is switched on after which we follow in detail the time-evolution of the system. Important features of the Kadanoff-Baym approach are 1) the possibility of studying the ultrafast dynamics of transients and other time-dependent regimes and 2) the inclusion of exchange and correlation effects in a conserving approximation scheme. We find that initial correlation and memory terms due to many-body interactions have a large effect on the transient currents. Furthermore the value of the steady state current is found to be strongly dependent on the approximation used to treat the electronic interactions. 
0808.03484	On the stable configuration of ultra-relativistic material spheres. The solution for the extremely hot gas	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:L. Neslusan	Abstract:  During the last stage of collapse of a compact object into the horizon of events, the potential energy of its surface layer decreases to a negative value below all limits. The energy-conservation law requires an appearance of a positive-valued energy to balance the decrease. We derive the internal-state properties of the ideal gas situated in an extremely strong, ultra-relativistic gravitational field and suggest to apply our result to a compact object with the radius which is slightly larger than or equal to the Schwarzschild's gravitational radius. On the surface of the object, we find that the extreme attractivity of the gravity is accompanied with an extremely high internal, heat energy. This internal energy implies a correspondingly high pressure, the gradient of which has such a behavior that it can compete with the gravity. In a more detail, we find the equation of state in the case when the magnitude of the potential-type energy of constituting gas particles is much larger than their rest energy. This equation appears to be identical with the general-relativity condition of the equilibrium between the gravity and pressure gradient. The consequences of the identity are discussed. 
0808.03485	A New Class of Radio Pulsars - Back in 1982	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Ali Alpar	Abstract:  Basic ideas about the torques on the neutron star and the existence of an equilibrium rotation period followed from the recognition that most X-ray binaries contain accretion powered neutron stars. The evolution of binaries through a phase of accretion onto the neutron star, eventually leading to a post-accretion radio pulsar phase, was initially discussed as a way to understand the scarcity of binaries among the radio pulsars and the relatively short rotation periods of the first discovered binary radio pulsars in terms of magnetic fields that would be smaller than the familiar $10^{12} G$ range. The discovery of the millisecond pulsars made us realize that the fields can be much lower in a new class of radio pulsars that have been spun up by accretion in LMXBs. The predicted spin-down rates of the millisecond pulsar was soon confirmed. The observers' search for millisecond X-ray periods was on, leading first to the discovery of QPOs, and eventually to the discovery of the X-ray millisecond pulsars. The theorists' quest for explanations of why X-ray millisecond pulsations are not observed from LMXBs also started right away. 
0808.03486	On functions of Jacobi-Weierstrass (I) and equation of Painleve	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Yu.V.Brezhnev	Abstract:  The paper is an essentially extended version of the work math.CA/0601371, supplemented with an application. We present new results in the theory of classical $θ$-functions of Jacobi and $σ$-functions of Weierstrass: ordinary differential equations and series expansions. We also give the extension of canonical $θ$-functions and consider an application to the sixth Painlevé equation (P6). Picard--Hitchin's general solution of P6 is represented explicitly in a form of logarithmic derivative of a corresponding $τ$-function (Painlevé's form). 
0808.03487	Size effect on thermodynamic properties of free nanocrystals	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:A. I. Karasevskii, V. V. Lubashenko	Abstract:  We demonstrate that the discrete character of the vibrational spectrum of a small crystal accounts for size dependence of its thermodynamic properties and melting temperature. Using a self-consistent statistical method [Phys. Rev.B 66, 054302 (2002)] we derive the Gibbs free energy of free nanocrystalline plates and calculate the thermodynamic parameters as functions of plate thickness for Cu. 
0808.03488	Discreteness Criteria and the Hyperbolic Geometry of Palindroms	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Jane Gilman, Linda Keen	Abstract:  We consider non-elementary representations of two generator free groups in $PSL(2,\mathbb{C})$, not necessarily discrete or free, $G = < A, B >$. A word in $A$ and $B$, $W(A,B)$, is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards. A word in a free group is {\sl primitive} if it is part of a minimal generating set. Primitive elements of the free group on two generators can be identified with the positive rational numbers. We study the geometry of palindromes and the action of $G$ in $\HH^3$ whether or not $G$ is discrete. We show that there is a {\sl core geodesic} $Ł$ in the convex hull of the limit set of $G$ and use it to prove three results: the first is that there are well defined maps from the non-negative rationals and from the primitive elements to $Ł$; the second is that $G$ is geometrically finite if and only if the axis of every non-parabolic palindromic word in $G$ intersects $Ł$ in a compact interval; the third is a description of the relation of the pleating locus of the convex hull boundary to the core geodesic and to palindromic elements. 
0808.03489	Periodic orbits of linear endomorphisms on the 2-torus and its lattices	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Michael Baake (Bielefeld), John A.G. Roberts (UNSW, Sydney), Alfred Weiss (Edmonton)    	Abstract:  Counting periodic orbits of endomorphisms on the 2-torus is considered, with special focus on the relation between global and local aspects and between the dynamical zeta function on the torus and its analogue on finite lattices. The situation on the lattices, up to local conjugacy, is completely determined by the determinant, the trace and a third invariant of the matrix defining the toral endomorphism. 
0808.03490	Pseudoscalar bosonic excitations in the color-flavor locked phase at moderate densities	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Verena Kleinhaus, Michael Buballa	Abstract:  The properties of pseudoscalar bosonic excitations in the color-flavor locked phase at moderate densities are studied within a model of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio type. Our previous analysis is extended to Goldstone bosons with hidden flavor and to higher-lying modes which stay massive in the chiral limit. The bosons are constructed explicitly by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation for quark-quark scattering in random phase approximation. The masses and weak decay constants of the Goldstone bosons are found in good agreement with predictions from the low-energy effective theory. In the non-Goldstone sector we find an SU(3) octet which is weakly bound, while the singlet appears to be unbound. 
0808.03491	Spin-Orbit Integrated Ground State and Magnetic Anisotropy in Sr$_2$IrO$_4$	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Hosub Jin, Hogyun Jeong, Taisuke Ozaki, Jaejun Yu	Abstract:  We present a microscopic model for the anisotropic exchange interactions in Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$. A direct construction of Wannier functions from first-principles calculations proves the $j_{\mathrm{eff}}$=1/2 character of the spin-orbit integrated states at the Fermi level. An effective $j_{\mathrm{eff}}$-spin Hamiltonian explains the observed weak ferromagnetism and anisotropy of antiferromagnetically ordered magnetic state, which arise naturally from the $j_{\mathrm{eff}}$=1/2 state with a rotation of IrO$_{6}$ octahedra. It is suggested that Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ is a unique class of materials with effective exchange interactions in the spin-orbital Hilbert space. 
0808.03492	X-Ray Afterglows	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Paul O'Brien (1), Richard Willingale (1) ((1) Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Leicester)    	Abstract:  We summarise the X-ray temporal and spectral variability properties of GRBs as observed using the Swift satellite. Despite much individual complexity, the flux and spectral variability can be reasonably well described by a combination of two components - which we denote as the prompt and the afterglow. The first, prompt component consists of the burst and its initial decay while the second, afterglow component fits the X-ray plateau phase and subsequent decline observed in the majority of GRBs. When strong spectral variability occurs it is associated with the prompt component while the X-ray plateau and later emission shows little if any spectral variability. We briefly compare the observations with some of the proposed models. Any model for the early or late emission must explain the differences in both temporal and spectral behaviour. 
0808.03493	Instanton Counting and Dielectric Branes	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:So Matsuura	Abstract:  We consider the Hanany-Witten type brane configuration in a background of RR 4-form field strength and examine the behavior of Euclidean D0-branes propagating between two NS5-branes. We evaluate the partition function of the D0-branes and show that it coincides with the Nekrasov partition function of instantons for four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. In this analysis, the Myers effect plays a crucial role. We apply the same method to the brane configuration realizing four-dimensional N=2 theory with hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation and reproduce the corresponding Nekrasov partition function. 
0808.03494	K-processes, scaling limit and aging for the trap model in the complete graph	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:L. R. G. Fontes, P. Mathieu	Abstract:  We study K-processes, which are Markov processes in a denumerable state space, all of whose elements are stable, with the exception of a single state, starting from which the process enters finite sets of stable states with uniform distribution. We show how these processes arise, in a particular instance, as scaling limits of the trap model in the complete graph, and subsequently derive aging results for those models in this context. 
0808.03495	Tail asymptotics for a random sign Lindley recursion	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Maria Vlasiou, Zbigniew Palmowski	Abstract:  We investigate the tail behaviour of the steady state distribution of a stochastic recursion that generalises Lindley's recursion. This recursion arises in queuing systems with dependent interarrival and service times, and includes alternating service systems and carousel storage systems as special cases. We obtain precise tail asymptotics in three qualitatively different cases, and compare these with existing results for Lindley's recursion and for alternating service systems. 
0808.03496	Gate-voltage dependence of Kondo effect in a triangular quantum dot	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:T. Numata, Y. Nisikawa, A. Oguri, A. C. Hewson	Abstract:  We study the conductance through a triangular triple quantum dot, which are connected to two noninteracting leads, using the numerical renormalization group (NRG). It is found that the system shows a variety of Kondo effects depending on the filling of the triangle. The SU(4) Kondo effect occurs at half-filling, and a sharp conductance dip due to a phase lapse appears in the gate-voltage dependence. Furthermore, when four electrons occupy the three sites on average, a local S=1 moment, which is caused by the Nagaoka mechanism, is induced along the triangle. The temperature dependence of the entropy and spin susceptibility of the triangle shows that this moment is screened by the conduction electrons via two separate stages at different temperatures. The two-terminal and four-terminal conductances show a clear difference at the gate voltages, where the SU(4) or the S=1 Kondo effects occurring. 
0808.03497	Thermally activated switching in the presence of non-Gaussian noise	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Lora Billings, Mark I. Dykman, Ira B. Schwartz	Abstract:  We study the effect of a non-Gaussian noise on interstate switching activated primarily by Gaussian noise. Even weak non-Gaussian noise can strongly change the switching rate. The effect is determined by all moments of the noise distribution. The explicit analytical results are compared with the results of simulations for an overdamped system driven by white Gaussian noise and a Poisson noise. Switching induced by a purely Poisson noise is also discussed. 
0808.03498	The ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density in generalized theories of gravity	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Ram Brustein, A.J.M. Medved	Abstract:  Near the horizon of a black brane solution in Anti-de Sitter space, the long-wavelength fluctuations of the metric exhibit hydrodynamic behaviour. For Einstein's theory, the ratio of the shear viscosity of near-horizon metric fluctuations eta to the entropy per unit of transverse volume s is eta/s=1/4 pi. We propose that, in generalized theories of gravity, this ratio is given by the ratio of two effective gravitational couplings and can be different than 1/4 pi. Our proposal implies that eta/s is equal for any pair of gravity theories that can be transformed into each other by a field redefinition. In particular, the ratio is 1/4 pi for any theory that can be transformed into Einstein's theory; such as F(R) gravity. Our proposal also implies that matter interactions -- except those including explicit or implicit factors of the Riemann tensor -- will not modify eta/s. The proposed formula reproduces, in a very simple manner, some recently found results for Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We also make a prediction for eta/s in Lovelock theories of any order or dimensionality. 
0808.03499	Differential systems with Fuchsian linear part: correction and linearization, normal forms and multiple orthogonal polynomials	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Rodica D. Costin	Abstract:  Differential systems with a Fuchsian linear part are studied in regions including all the singularities in the complex plane of these equations. Such systems are not necessarily analytically equivalent to their linear part (they are not linearizable) and obstructions are found as a unique nonlinear correction after which the system becomes formally linearizable. More generally, normal forms are found. The corrections and the normal forms are found constructively. Expansions in multiple orthogonal polynomials and their generalization to matrix-valued polynomials are instrumental to these constructions. 
0808.03500	Gravitational production of KK states	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Cosimo Bambi, Federico R. Urban	Abstract:  Gravitational particle production in the context of braneworlds is considered from a phenomenological point of view. The production of KK modes for bulk fields is discussed and their abundances computed. The results have been applied to some specific fields such as gravitinos and axions, and their cosmologies have been outlined, exemplifying the constraints on the properties of the extra dimensional model in each case. 
0808.03501	Suzaku Observation of 30Dor C: A Supernova Remnant with the Largest Non-Thermal Shell	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Hiroya Yamaguchi, Aya Bamba, Katsuji Koyama	Abstract:  This paper reports on the Suzaku results of thermal and non-thermal features of 30 Dor C, a supernova remnant (SNR) in a superbubble of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The west rim exhibits a non-thermal X-ray spectrum with no thermal component. A single power-law model is rejected but a power-law model with spectral cutoff is accepted. The cutoff frequency of $(3-7)\times 10^{17}$ Hz is the highest among the shell type SNRs like SN 1006 ($\sim 6\times 10^{16}$ Hz), and hence 30 Dor C would be the site of the highest energy accelerator of the SNR shock. The southeast (SE) and northeast (NE) rims have both the thermal and non-thermal components. The thin-thermal plasmas in the both rims are in collisional ionization equilibrium state. The electron temperature of the plasma in the SE rim ($kT_e \sim 0.7$ keV) is found to be higher than the previously reported value. The power-law index from SE is nearly the same as, while that from the NE is larger than that of the West rim. The SNR age would be in the range of $(4-20)\times 10^3$ yr. Thus, 30 Dor C is likely to be the oldest shell-like SNR with non-thermal emission. 
0808.03502	Cooperative Protocols for Random Access Networks	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Georg Böcherer, Alexandre de Baynast	Abstract:  Cooperative communications have emerged as a significant concept to improve reliability and throughput in wireless systems. On the other hand, WLANs based on random access mechanism have become popular due to ease of deployment and low cost. Since cooperation introduces extra transmissions among the cooperating nodes and therefore increases the number of packet collisions, it is not clear whether there is any benefit from using physical layer cooperation under random access. In this paper, we develop new low complexity cooperative protocols for random access that outperform the conventional non cooperative scheme for a large range of signal-to-noise ratios. 
0808.03503	Chaotic Scattering in the Regime of Weakly Overlapping Resonances	Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)	Authors:B. Dietz, T. Friedrich, H. L. Harney, M. Miski-Oglu, A. Richter, F. Schaefer, H. A. Weidenmueller	Abstract:  We measure the transmission and reflection amplitudes of microwaves in a resonator coupled to two antennas at room temperature in the regime of weakly overlapping resonances and in a frequency range of 3 to 16 GHz. Below 10.1 GHz the resonator simulates a chaotic quantum system. The distribution of the elements of the scattering matrix S is not Gaussian. The Fourier coefficients of S are used for a best fit of the autocorrelation function if S to a theoretical expression based on random--matrix theory. We find very good agreement below but not above 10.1 GHz. 
0808.03504	On the Growth Rate of the Weight Distribution of Irregular Doubly-Generalized LDPC Codes	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Mark F. Flanagan, Enrico Paolini, Marco Chiani, Marc Fossorier	Abstract:  In this paper, an expression for the asymptotic growth rate of the number of small linear-weight codewords of irregular doubly-generalized LDPC (D-GLDPC) codes is derived. The expression is compact and generalizes existing results for LDPC and generalized LDPC (GLDPC) codes. Assuming that there exist check and variable nodes with minimum distance 2, it is shown that the growth rate depends only on these nodes. An important connection between this new result and the stability condition of D-GLDPC codes over the BEC is highlighted. Such a connection, previously observed for LDPC and GLDPC codes, is now extended to the case of D-GLDPC codes. 
0808.03505	A note on DSR	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Carlo Rovelli	Abstract:  I study the physical meaning of Deformed, or Doubly, Special Relativity (DSR). I argue that DSR could be physically relevant in a certain large-distance limit. I consider a concrete physical effect: the gravitational slowing down of time due to the gravitational potential well of a massive-particle, and its effect on the dynamics of the particle itself. I argue that this physical effect can survive in a limit in which gravitation and quantum mechanics can be disregarded, and that taking it into account leads directy to the Girelli-Livine DSR formalism. This provides a physical interpretation to the corresponding 5d spacetime, and a concrete physical derivation of DSR. 
0808.03506	Extraction of SUSY Parameters from Collider Data	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Dirk Zerwas	Abstract:  The extraction of the parameters of the supersymmetric Lagrangian is discusse d. Particular emphasis is put on the rigorous treatment of experimental and theo retical errors. While the LHC can provide a valuable first estimate of the parameters, the combination of LHC and ILC will be nece ssary to determine with high precision the parameters of the MSSM. 
0808.03507	Pairing Vibrations Study with the Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Benoît Avez (SPhN), Cédric Simenel (SPhN), Philippe Chomaz (GANIL, IRFU)    	Abstract:  We study pairing vibrations in $^{18,20,22}$O and $^{42,44,46}$Ca nuclei solving the time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov equation in coordinate space with spherical symmetry. We use the SLy4 Skyrme functional in the normal part of the energy density functional and a local density dependent functional in its pairing part. Pairing vibrations are excited by two-neutron transfer operators. Strength distributions are obtained using the Fourier transform of the time-dependent response of two-neutron pair-transfer observables in the linear regime. Results are in overall agreement with quasiparticle random phase approximation calculations for Oxygen isotopes, though differences appear when increasing the neutron number. Both low lying pairing modes and giant pairing vibrations (GPV) are discussed. The GPV is observed in the Oxygen but not in the Calcium isotopes. 
0808.03508	Comprehensive Analysis of Neutrinos in SK part 3 -- L/E Analysis for Single Ring Muon Events II --	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:E. Konishi (1), Y. Minorikawa (2), V.I. Galkin (3), M. Ishiwata (4), I. Nakamura (4), N. Takahashi (1), M. Kato (5), A. Misaki (6) ((1) Hirosaki University, Japan, (2) Kinki University, Japan, (3) Moscow State University, Russia, (4) Saitama University, Japan, (5) Kyowa Interface Science Co., Ltd., Japan,(6) Waseda University, Japan)    	Abstract:  Following the L_nu/E_nu analysis in the preceding paper of the Fully Contained Muon Events resulting from the quasi-elastic scattering obtained from our numerical computer experiment. In the present paper, we carry out the analyses of L_nu/E_mu, L_mu/E_nu and L_mu/E_mu among four possible combinations of L and E. As the result of it, we show that we can not find the characteristis of maximum oscillation for neutrino oscillation among two of three, L_mu/E_mu and L_mu/E_nu. Only the L_nu/E_mu distribution can show something like maximum oscillation, however it cannot be detected owing to the neutral character of L_nu. It is concluded that the Super-Kamiokande Experiment could not have found the existence of the maximum oscillation for neutrino oscillation.

Construction of the expansion in the mass ratio m_c/m_b as well as the evaluation of new four-loop master integrals are presented. The same techniques are applicable to the muon decay, mu -> e,nu_mu,anti-nu_e. Analytical results are presented, for the physical cases as well as for a model with purely-vector couplings. 
0808.03510	A Reconstruction Algorithm for Photoacoustic Imaging based on the Nonuniform FFT	Numerical Analysis (math.NA)	Authors:M. Haltmeier, O. Scherzer, G. Zangerl	Abstract:  Fourier reconstruction algorithms significantly outperform conventional back-projection algorithms in terms of computation time. In photoacoustic imaging, these methods require interpolation in the Fourier space domain, which creates artifacts in reconstructed images. We propose a novel reconstruction algorithm that applies the one-dimensional nonuniform fast Fourier transform to photoacoustic imaging. It is shown theoretically and numerically that our algorithm avoids artifacts while preserving the computational effectiveness of Fourier reconstruction. 
0808.03511	Conditional probability based significance tests for sequential patterns in multi-neuronal spike trains	Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)	Authors:P.S. Sastry (Indian Institute of Science), K.P. Unnikrishnan (General Motors Research)    	Abstract:  In this paper we consider the problem of detecting statistically significant sequential patterns in multi-neuronal spike trains. These patterns are characterized by ordered sequences of spikes from different neurons with specific delays between spikes. We have previously proposed a data mining scheme to efficiently discover such patterns which are frequent in the sense that the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the pattern in the data stream is above a threshold. Here we propose a method to determine the statistical significance of these repeating patterns and to set the thresholds automatically. The novelty of our approach is that we use a compound null hypothesis that includes not only models of independent neurons but also models where neurons have weak dependencies. The strength of interaction among the neurons is represented in terms of certain pair-wise conditional probabilities. We specify our null hypothesis by putting an upper bound on all such conditional probabilities. We construct a probabilistic model that captures the counting process and use this to calculate the mean and variance of the count for any pattern. Using this we derive a test of significance for rejecting such a null hypothesis. This also allows us to rank-order different significant patterns. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach using spike trains generated from a non-homogeneous Poisson model with embedded dependencies. 
0808.03512	Aperiodic Ising model on the Bethe lattice: Exact results	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:F. Igloi (1,2,3), L. Turban (3) ((1) Research Institute for Solid State Physics and Optics, Budapest, (2) Institute of Theoretical Physics, Szeged University, (3) Laboratoire de Physique des Materiaux, Nancy-Universite)    	Abstract:  We consider the Ising model on the Bethe lattice with aperiodic modulation of the couplings, which has been studied numerically in Phys. Rev. E 77, 041113 (2008). Here we present a relevance-irrelevance criterion and solve the critical behavior exactly for marginal aperiodic sequences. We present analytical formulae for the continuously varying critical exponents and discuss a relationship with the (surface) critical behavior of the aperiodic quantum Ising chain. 
0808.03513	A Chevalley's theorem in class C^r	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Gerard Barbançon	Abstract:  Let W be a finite reflection group acting orthogonally on R^n, P be the Chevalley polynomial mapping determined by an integrity basis of the algebra of W-invariant polynomials, and h be the highest degree of the coordinate polynomials in P.There exists a linear mapping from (C^r(R^n))^W to C^[r/h](R^n), f\mapsto F such that f=F \circ P, continuous for the natural Fréchet topologies. A general counterexample shows that this result is the best possible. The proof uses techniques of division by linear forms and a study of compensation phenomenons. An extension to P^{-1}(R^n) of invariant formally holomorphic regular fields is needed. 
0808.03514	Logarithmic current fluctuations in non-equilibrium quantum spin chains	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Tibor Antal, P. L. Krapivsky, A. Rákos	Abstract:  We study zero-temperature quantum spin chains which are characterized by a non-vanishing current. For the XX model starting from the initial state |... + + + - - - ...> we derive an exact expression for the variance of the total spin current. We show that asymptotically the variance exhibits an anomalously slow logarithmic growth; we also extract the sub-leading constant term. We then argue that the logarithmic growth remains valid for the XXZ model in the critical region. 
0808.03515	Generating Static Fluid Spheres by Conformal Transformations	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Jonathan Loranger, Kayll Lake	Abstract:  We generate an explicit four-fold infinity of physically acceptable exact perfect fluid solutions of Einstein's equations by way of conformal transformations of physically unacceptable solutions (one way to view the use of isotropic coordinates). Special cases include the Schwarzschild interior solution and the Einstein static universe. The process we consider involves solving two equations of the Riccati type coupled by a single generating function rather than a specification of one of the two metric functions. 
0808.03516	Edge percolation on a random regular graph of low degree	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Boris Pittel	Abstract:  Consider a uniformly random regular graph of a fixed degree $d\ge3$, with $n$ vertices. Suppose that each edge is open (closed), with probability $p(q=1-p)$, respectively. In 2004 Alon, Benjamini and Stacey proved that $p^*=(d-1)^{-1}$ is the threshold probability for emergence of a giant component in the subgraph formed by the open edges. In this paper we show that the transition window around $p^*$ has width roughly of order $n^{-1/3}$. More precisely, suppose that $p=p(n)$ is such that $ω:=n^{1/3}|p-p^*|\to\infty$. If $p<p^*$, then with high probability (whp) the largest component has $O((p-p^*)^{-2}\log n)$ vertices. If $p>p^*$, and $\logω\gg\log\log n$, then whp the largest component has about $n(1-(pπ+q)^d)\asymp n(p-p^*)$ vertices, and the second largest component is of size $(p-p^*)^{-2}(\log n)^{1+o(1)}$, at most, where $π=(pπ+q)^{d-1},π\in(0,1)$. If $ω$ is merely polylogarithmic in $n$, then whp the largest component contains $n^{2/3+o(1)}$ vertices.

Campbell	Abstract:  I review the status of theoretical predictions for events containing a W or Z boson and jets, one or more of which may include heavy quarks. Special attention is paid to comparisons between different theoretical approaches and with the latest experimental data. 
0808.03518	Topologie sur l'ensemble des parties positives d'un réseau	General Topology (math.GN)	Authors:Cédric Bonnafé (LM-Besan\c{c}on)    	Abstract:  We define a notion of {\it positive part} of a lattice $Λ$ and we endow the set of such positive parts with a topology. We then study some properties of this topology, by comparing it with the one of $V^*/\RM_{> 0}$, where $V^*$ is the dual vector space of $\RM \otimes_\ZM Λ$. 
0808.03519	Theory of Cherenkov radiation in periodic dielectric media: Emission spectrum	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Christian Kremers, Dmitry N. Chigrin, Johann Kroha	Abstract:  The Cherenkov radiation is substantially modified in the presence of a medium with a nontrivial dispersion relation. We consider Cherenkov emission spectra of a point charge moving in general three- (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystals. Exact analytical expressions for the spectral distribution of the radiated power are obtained in terms of the Bloch mode expansion. The resulting expression reduces to a simple contour integral (3D case) or a one-dimensional sum (2D case) over a small fraction of the reciprocal space, which is defined by the generalized Cherenkov condition. We apply our method to a specific case of an electron moving with different velocities in a 2D square-lattice photonic crystal. Our method demonstrates an excellent agreement with numerically rigorous finite-difference time-domain calculations while being less demanding on computational resources. 
0808.03520	Unconventional pairs glued by conventional phonons in cuprate superconductors	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:A. S. Alexandrov	Abstract:  It has gone almost unquestioned that superexchange in the t-J (or Hubbard) model, and not phonons, is responsible for the unconventional ("d-wave") pairing symmetry of cuprate superconductors. However a number of advanced numerical studies have not found superconductivity in the Hubbard model. On the other hand compelling experimental evidence for a strong electron-phonon interaction (EPI) has currently arrived. Here I briefly review some phonon-mediated unconventional pairing mechanisms. In particular the anisotropy of sound velocity makes the phonon-mediated attraction of electrons non-local in space providing unconventional Cooper pairs with a nonzero orbital momentum already in the framework of the conventional BCS theory with weak EPI. In the opposite limit of strong EPI rotational symmetry breaking appears as a result of a reduced Coulomb repulsion between unconventional bipolarons. Using the variational Monte-Carlo method we have found that a relatively weak finite-range EPI induces a d-wave BCS state also in doped Mott-Hubbard insulators or strongly-correlated metals. These results tell us that poorly screened EPI with conventional phonons is responsible for the unconventional pairing in cuprate superconductors. 
0808.03521	The universal Cannon--Thurston maps and the boundary of the curve complex	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Christopher J. Leininger, Mahan Mj, Saul Schleimer	Abstract:  In genus two and higher, the fundamental group of a closed surface acts naturally on the curve complex of the surface with one puncture. Combining ideas from previous work of Kent--Leininger--Schleimer and Mitra, we construct a universal Cannon--Thurston map from a subset of the circle at infinity for the closed surface group onto the boundary of the curve complex of the once-punctured surface. Using the techniques we have developed, we also show that the boundary of this curve complex is locally path-connected. 
0808.03522	Semicontinuity properties of Kazhdan-Lusztig cells	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Cédric Bonnafé (LM-Besan\c{c}on)    	Abstract:  Computations in small Coxeter groups or dihedral groups suggest that the partition into Kazhdan-Lusztig cells with unequal parameters should obey to some semicontinuity phenomenon (as the parameters vary). The aim of this paper is to provide a rigorous theoretical background for supporting this intuition that will allow to state several precise conjectures. 
0808.03523	Homologous Core Collapse in a Massive Star and Self-Similar Evolution of Rebound Shocks	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yi Cao, Yu-Qing Lou	Abstract:  During the gravitational core collapse of a massive progenitor star which may give rise to at least a class of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) associated with supernovae, a stellar core rapidly passes through a short yet important phase of neutronization, producing a huge amount of energetic neutrinos and photons which contribute to the total pressure within the progenitor core. The collection of neutrinos, photons and gas materials together may be approximated as a fluid with a polytropic index $γ=4/3$ under the action of self-gravity. With a substantial generalization and using analytical and numerical methods (Lou & Cao 2008), we recently constructed and examined various self-similar solutions to describe collapses, rebound shocks and flows systematically in a $γ=4/3$ polytropic gas mixture with spherical symmetry, and compare our results with those of Goldreich & Weber (1980). It is also possible to construct central void solutions without or with shocks. Various features and characteristics of this nonlinear relativistically hot gas dynamics, including asymptotic and exact solutions, are presented. This more general polytropic model analysis provides the dynamic basis of understanding the evolution of rebound shocks in supernovae (SNs) and the results may be also utilized to benchmark hydrodynamic simulations. 
0808.03524	Measurement of the B+ -> omega l+ nu and B+ -> eta l+ nu Branching Fractions	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We present a study of the charmless semileptonic B-meson decays B+ -> omega l+ nu and B+ -> eta l+ nu. The analysis is based on 383 million BBbar pairs recorded at the Upsilon(4S) resonance with the BABAR detector. The omega mesons are reconstructed in the channel omega -> pi+ pi- pi0 and the eta mesons in the channels eta -> pi+ pi- pi0 and eta -> gamma gamma. We measure the branching fractions B(B+ -> omega l+ nu) = (1.14 +- 0.16 (stat) +- 0.08 (syst)) x 10^-4 and B(B+ -> eta l+ nu) = (0.31 +- 0.06 (stat) +- 0.08 (syst)) x 10^-4. 
0808.03525	Mass and total energy of moving bodies in a quantified expansion	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:Faycal Ben Adda	Abstract:  In this paper, we present a new formulation of Lorentz transformations using a metric that quantifies the space expansion. As a consequence, we sort out that the limiting velocity of moving bodies is decreasing together with the space expansion. A new adjustment of relativistic laws is added to incorporate the non static nature of space-time. The conservation of the physical laws at each step of the quantified expansion allows the obtaining of new formalisms for the physical laws, in particular when an object starts moving under any force, its total energy, momentum and mass are directly affected by the expansion of the space. An example of inelastic collision is studied and several conclusions derived, specially the example of fission of atoms leads to clear correlation between liberated energy and universe expansion, it turns out that the liberated energy is increasing together with the universe expansion. 
0808.03526	Thermoelectric Effects in Anisotropic Systems: Measurement and Applications	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:T. W. Silk, A. J. Schofield	Abstract:  The Harman method for measuring the thermal conductivity of a sample using the Peltier effect, may also be used to determine the dimensionless figure of merit from just two electrical resistance measurements. We consider a modified version of the Harman method where the current contacts are much smaller than the contact faces of the sample. We calculate the voltage and temperature distributions in a rectangular sample of a material having anisotropy in all of its transport coefficients. The thermoelectric anisotropy has important consequences in the form of thermoelectric eddy currents and the Bridgman effect. We prove that in the limit of a very thin sample of arbitrary shape, there exist van der Pauw formulae relating particular linear combinations of the potential and temperature differences between points on the edges of the sample. We show that the Harman figure of merit can be radically different from the intrinsic figures of merit of the material, and can often be substantially enhanced. By defining an effective figure of merit in terms of the rate of entropy production, we show that the increase in the Harman figure of merit does indicate an improvement in the thermoelectric performance of an anisotropic sample having small current contacts. However, we also prove that in the case of a material with tetragonal symmetry, the effective figure of merit is always bounded from above by the largest intrinsic figure of merit of the material. 
0808.03527	The influence of direct $D$-meson production to the determination on the nucleon strangeness asymmetry via dimuon events in neutrino experiments	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Puze Gao, Bo-Qiang Ma	Abstract:  Experimentally, the production of oppositely charged dimuon events by neutrino and anti-neutrino deep inelastic scattering (DIS) is used to determine the strangeness asymmetry inside a nucleon. Here we point out that the direct production of $D$-meson in DIS may make substantial influence to the measurement of nucleon strange distributions. The direct $D$-meson production is via the heavy quark recombination (HQR) and via the light quark fragmentation from perturbative QCD (LQF-P). To see the influence precisely, we compute the direct $D$-meson productions via HQR and LQF-P quantitatively and estimate their corrections to the analysis of the strangeness asymmetry. The results show that HQR has stronger effect than LQF-P does, and the former may influence the experimental determination of the nucleon strangeness asymmetry. 
0808.03528	Interaction between negative and positive index medium waveguides	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Wei Yan, Linfang Shen, Yu Yuan, Tzong Jer Yang	Abstract:  The coupling between negative and positive index medium waveguides is investigated theoretically in this paper. A coupled mode theory is developed for such a waveguide system and its validity is verified. Interesting phenomena in the coupled waveguides are demonstrated, which occur in the case when the negative index medium waveguide in isolation guides its mode backward. A new type of coupled mode solution that varies exponentially with the coupling length is found in the special case when the propagation constants of two individual waveguides are nearly the same. A coupler operating in this case is insensitive to the coupling length, and its coupling efficiency can reach 100% as long as the coupling length is long enough. However, when the propagation constants of the two individual waveguides differ greatly, the coupled mode solution is still a periodic function of the coupling length, but the coupled power is output backward. In addition, the modes in the composite waveguide system are also studied using the coupled mode theory, and their fundamental properties are revealed. 
0808.03529	On the fine structure photodetachment intensities using the irreducible tensorial expression of second quantization operators	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:Oliver Scharf, Michel R. Godefroid	Abstract:  The branching ratios of the fine-structure photodetachment intensities of S- have been calculated by Blondel et al. (J. Phys. B 39(2006)1409) using the standard irreducible tensorial operator techniques. They observed that the relative intensities were consistent with the well known Engelking-Lineberger formula (Phys. Rev. A19(1979)149) derived from the fractional parentage approach, and qualified this agreement as remarkable. In the present paper, we show that it can be understood from a general interesting angular momentum expression relating a weighted sum of squared 9j-symbols and a weighted sum of products of squared 6j-symbols. We also point out that the standard approach result is a special case of the photodetachment cross sections parametrization by Pan and Starace (Phys. Rev. A47(1993)295) who already established the link with the Engelking-Lineberger's result. The present work provides a new, elegant and deep link between the two formalisms, thanks to the irreducible tensorial expression of the second quantization form of the electric dipole transition operator. 
0808.03530	On the Percolation BCFT and the Crossing Probability of Watts	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:David Ridout	Abstract:  The logarithmic conformal field theory describing critical percolation is further explored using Watts' determination of the probability that there exists a cluster connecting both horizontal and vertical edges. The boundary condition changing operator which governs Watts' computation is identified with a primary field which does not fit naturally within the extended Kac table. Instead a "shifted" extended Kac table is shown to be relevant. Augmenting the previously known logarithmic theory based on Cardy's crossing probability by this field, a larger theory is obtained, in which new classes of indecomposable rank-2 modules are present. No rank-3 Jordan cells are yet observed. A highly non-trivial check of the identification of Watts' field is that no Gurarie-Ludwig-type inconsistencies are observed in this augmentation. The article concludes with an extended discussion of various topics related to extending these results including projectivity, boundary sectors and inconsistency loopholes. 
0808.03531	A sphere moving down the surface of a static sphere and a simple phase diagram	Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)	Authors:V. Jayanth (Mechanical Engineering), C. Raghunandan (EEE), Anindya Kumar Biswas (Physics BITS-Pilani Goa Campus, Vasco, Goa)    	Abstract:  A small sphere placed on the top of a big static frictionless sphere, slips until it leaves the surface at an angle $θ_{l}=\cos^{-1}{2/3}$. On the other extreme, if the surface of the big sphere has coefficient of static friction, $μ_s\to\infty$, the small sphere starts rolling and continues to do so until it leaves the surface at an angle $θ_{l} =\cos^{-1}{10/17}$. In the case where, $0\leqμ_s<\infty$, we get a simple phase diagram. The three phases are pure rolling, rolling with slipping and detached state. One phase line separates pure rolling from rolling with slipping. This diagram is obtained when stopping angles for pure rolling are plotted against static friction coefficients $μ_s$. Study in this article is restricted to the case when the mobile sphere starts at the top of the static sphere with infinitesimal kinetic energy. 
0808.03532	Dynamic origin of the morphotropic phase boundary - Soft modes and phase instability in 0.68Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3O3)-0.32PbTiO3	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Hu Cao, Chris Stock, Guangyong Xu, Peter M. Gehring, Jiefang Li, Dwight Viehland	Abstract:  We report neutron inelastic scattering on single crystal 0.68Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3O3)-0.32PbTiO3 (PMN-0.32PT), a relaxor ferroelectric material that lies within the compositional range of the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB). Data were obtained between 100 K and 600 K under zero and non-zero electric field applied along the cubic [001] direction. The lowest energy, zone-center, transverse optic phonon is strongly damped and softens slowly at high temperature; however the square of the soft mode energy begins to increase linearly with temperature as in a conventional ferroelectric, which we term the soft mode "recovery," upon cooling into the tetragonal phase at TC. Our data show that the soft mode in PMN-0.32PT behaves almost identically to that in pure PMN, exhibiting the same temperature dependence and recovery temperature even though PMN exhibits no well-defined structural transition (no TC). The temperature dependence of the soft mode in PMN-0.32PT is also similar to that in PMN-0.60PT; however in PMN-0.60PT the recovery temperature equals TC. These results suggest that the temperature dependence and the energy scale of the soft mode dynamics in PMN-xPT are independent of concentration on the Ti-poor side of the MPB, but scale with TC for Ti-rich compositions. Thus the MPB may be defined in lattice dynamical terms as the concentration where TC first matches the recovery temperature of the soft mode. High-resolution x-ray studies show that the cubic-to-ferroelectric phase boundary shifts to higher temperatures by an abnormal amount within the MPB region in the presence of an electric field. This suggests that an unusual instability exists within the apparently cubic phase at the MPB. 
0808.03533	The Ponzano-Regge asymptotic of the 6j symbol: an elementary proof	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Razvan Gurau	Abstract:  In this paper we give a direct proof of the Ponzano-Regge asymptotic formula for the Wigner 6j symbol starting from Racah's single sum formula. Our method treats halfinteger and integer spins on the same footing. The generalization to Minkowskian tetrahedra is direct. This result should be relevant for the introduction of renormalization scales in spin foam models. 
0808.03534	A Case of Subdominant/Suppressed "High Energy" Contribution to the Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe in Flavoured Leptogenesis	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:E. Molinaro, S.T. Petcov	Abstract:  The CP-violation necessary for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe $Y_B$ in the "flavoured" leptogenesis scenario can arise from the "low energy" PMNS neutrino mixing matrix $U$ and/or from the "high energy" part of neutrino Yukawa couplings, which can mediate CP-violating phenomena only at some high energy scale. The possible interplay between these two types of CP-violation is analysed. The type I see-saw model with three heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos having hierarchical spectrum is considered. We show that in the case of inverted hierarchical light neutrino mass spectrum, there exist regions in the corresponding leptogenesis parameter space where the relevant "high energy" phases have large CP-violating values, but the purely "high energy" contribution in $Y_B$ plays a subdominant role in the production of baryon asymmetry compatible with the observations. In some of these regions the purely "high energy" contribution in $Y_B$ is so strongly suppressed that one can have successful leptogenesis only if the requisite CP-violation is provided by the Majorana phase(s) in the neutrino mixing matrix. 
0808.03535	Data Diffusion: Dynamic Resource Provision and Data-Aware Scheduling for Data Intensive Applications	Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)	Authors:Ioan Raicu, Yong Zhao, Ian Foster, Alex Szalay	Abstract:  Data intensive applications often involve the analysis of large datasets that require large amounts of compute and storage resources. While dedicated compute and/or storage farms offer good task/data throughput, they suffer low resource utilization problem under varying workloads conditions. If we instead move such data to distributed computing resources, then we incur expensive data transfer cost. In this paper, we propose a data diffusion approach that combines dynamic resource provisioning, on-demand data replication and caching, and data locality-aware scheduling to achieve improved resource efficiency under varying workloads. We define an abstract "data diffusion model" that takes into consideration the workload characteristics, data accessing cost, application throughput and resource utilization; we validate the model using a real-world large-scale astronomy application. Our results show that data diffusion can increase the performance index by as much as 34X, and improve application response time by over 506X, while achieving near-optimal throughputs and execution times. 
0808.03536	Enabling Loosely-Coupled Serial Job Execution on the IBM BlueGene/P Supercomputer and the SiCortex SC5832	Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)	Authors:Ioan Raicu, Zhao Zhang, Mike Wilde, Ian Foster	Abstract:  Our work addresses the enabling of the execution of highly parallel computations composed of loosely coupled serial jobs with no modifications to the respective applications, on large-scale systems. This approach allows new-and potentially far larger-classes of application to leverage systems such as the IBM Blue Gene/P supercomputer and similar emerging petascale architectures. We present here the challenges of I/O performance encountered in making this model practical, and show results using both micro-benchmarks and real applications on two large-scale systems, the BG/P and the SiCortex SC5832. Our preliminary benchmarks show that we can scale to 4096 processors on the Blue Gene/P and 5832 processors on the SiCortex with high efficiency, and can achieve thousands of tasks/sec sustained execution rates for parallel workloads of ordinary serial applications. We measured applications from two domains, economic energy modeling and molecular dynamics. 
0808.03537	State Preparation by Optical Pumping in Erbium Doped Solids using Stimulated Emission and Spin Mixing	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:B. Lauritzen, S. R. Hastings-Simon, H. de Riedmatten, M. Afzelius, N. Gisin	Abstract:  Erbium doped solids are potential candidates for the realization of a quantum memory for photons at telecommunication wavelengths. The implementation of quantum memory proposals in rare earth ion doped solids require spectral tailoring of the inhomogeneous absorption profile by efficient population transfer between ground state levels (spin polarization) using optical pumping. In this article we investigate the limiting factors of efficient optical pumping between ground state Zeeman levels in an erbium doped Y2SiO5 crystal. We introduce two methods to overcome these limiting factors: stimulated emission using a second laser and spin mixing using radio frequency excitation. Both methods significantly improve the degree of spin polarization. Population transfer between two Zeeman levels with less than 10 % of the total population in the initial ground state is achieved, corresponding to a spin polarization greater than 90 %. In addition, we demonstrate spectral tailoring by isolating a narrow absorption peak within a large transparency window. 
0808.03538	Long-distance atom-photon entanglement	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:W. Rosenfeld, F. Hocke, F. Henkel, M. Krug, J. Volz, M. Weber, H. Weinfurter	Abstract:  We report the observation of entanglement between a single trapped atom and a single photon at remote locations. The degree of coherence of the entangled atom-photon pair is verified via appropriate local correlation measurements, after communicating the photon via an optical fiber link of 300 m length. In addition we measured the temporal evolution of the atomic density matrix after projecting the atom via a state measurement of the photon onto several well defined spin states. We find that the state of the single atom dephases on a timescale of 150 $μ$s, which represents an important step toward long-distance quantum networking with individual neutral atoms. 
0808.03539	On the Thermodynamic Origin of the Quantum Potential	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Gerhard Groessing	Abstract:  The quantum potential is shown to result from the presence of a subtle thermal vacuum energy distributed across the whole domain of an experimental setup. Explicitly, its form is demonstrated to be exactly identical to the heat distribution derived from the defining equation for classical diffusion-wave fields. For a single free particle path, this thermal energy does not significantly affect particle motion. However, in between different paths, or at interfaces, the accumulation-depletion law for diffusion waves provides an immediate new understanding of the quantum potential's main features. 
0808.03540	Towards Loosely-Coupled Programming on Petascale Systems	Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)	Authors:Ioan Raicu, Zhao Zhang, Mike Wilde, Ian Foster, Pete Beckman, Kamil Iskra, Ben Clifford	Abstract:  We have extended the Falkon lightweight task execution framework to make loosely coupled programming on petascale systems a practical and useful programming model. This work studies and measures the performance factors involved in applying this approach to enable the use of petascale systems by a broader user community, and with greater ease. Our work enables the execution of highly parallel computations composed of loosely coupled serial jobs with no modifications to the respective applications. This approach allows a new-and potentially far larger-class of applications to leverage petascale systems, such as the IBM Blue Gene/P supercomputer. We present the challenges of I/O performance encountered in making this model practical, and show results using both microbenchmarks and real applications from two domains: economic energy modeling and molecular dynamics. Our benchmarks show that we can scale up to 160K processor-cores with high efficiency, and can achieve sustained execution rates of thousands of tasks per second. 
0808.03541	Dante, astrology and astronomy	History and Philosophy of Physics (physics.hist-ph)	Authors:Alejandro Gangui	Abstract:  Some verses of Dante Alighieri suggest his astrological sign and his probable date of birth.

0808.03542	Superconducting state of quasiparticles with spin dependent mass and their distinguishability for Cooper-pair state	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:J. Spalek, M. M. Maska, M. Mierzejewski, J. Kaczmarczyk	Abstract:  Spin dependence of quasiparticle mass has been observed recently in CeCoIn5 and other systems. It emerges from strong electronic correlations in a magnetically polarized state and was predicted earlier. Additionally, the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)phase has also been discovered in CeCoIn5 and therefore, the question arises as to what extent these two basic phenomena are interconnected, as it appears in theory. Here we show that the appearance of the spin-split masses essentially extends the regime of temperature and applied magnetic field, in which FFLO state is stable, and thus, it is claimed to be very important for the phase detectability. Furthermore, in the situation when the value of the spin z-component σ differentiates masses of the particles, the fundamental question is to what extent the two mutually bound particles are indistinguishable quantum mechanically? By considering first the Cooper-pair state we show explicitly that the antisymmetry of the spin-pair wave function in the ground state may be broken when the magnetic field is applied. 
0808.03543	Magnetic anisotropy and reversal in epitaxial Fe/MgO(001) films revisited	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Qing-feng Zhan, Stijn Vandezande, Kristiaan Temst, Chris Van Haesendonck	Abstract:  We investigate the magnetization reversal in Fe/MgO(001) films with fourfold in-plane magnetic anisotropy and an additional uniaxial anisotropy whose orientation and strength are tuned using different growth geometries and post growth treatments. The previously adopted mechanism of 180^{o} domain wall nucleation clearly fails to explain the observed 180^{o} magnetization reversal. A new reversal mechanism with two successive domain wall nucleations consistently predicts the switching fields for all field orientations. Our results are relevant for a correct interpretation of magnetization reversal in many other epitaxial metallic and semiconducting thin films. 
0808.03544	The universal Kummer congruences	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Shaofang Hong, Jianrong Zhao, Wei Zhao	Abstract:  Let $p$ be a prime. In this paper, we present a detailed $p$-adic analysis to factorials and double factorials and their congruences. We give good bounds for the $p$-adic sizes of the coefficients of the divided universal Bernoulli number ${{\hat B_n}\over n}$ when $n$ is divisible by $p-1$. Using these we then establish the universal Kummer congruences modulo powers of a prime $p$ for the divided universal Bernoulli numbers ${{\hat B_n}\over n}$ when $n$ is divisible by $p-1$. 
0808.03545	Scientific Workflow Systems for 21st Century e-Science, New Bottle or New Wine?	Software Engineering (cs.SE)	Authors:Yong Zhao, Ioan Raicu, Ian Foster	Abstract:  With the advances in e-Sciences and the growing complexity of scientific analyses, more and more scientists and researchers are relying on workflow systems for process coordination, derivation automation, provenance tracking, and bookkeeping. While workflow systems have been in use for decades, it is unclear whether scientific workflows can or even should build on existing workflow technologies, or they require fundamentally new approaches. In this paper, we analyze the status and challenges of scientific workflows, investigate both existing technologies and emerging languages, platforms and systems, and identify the key challenges that must be addressed by workflow systems for e-science in the 21st century. 
0808.03546	Accelerating Large-scale Data Exploration through Data Diffusion	Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)	Authors:Ioan Raicu, Yong Zhao, Ian Foster, Alex Szalay	Abstract:  Data-intensive applications often require exploratory analysis of large datasets. If analysis is performed on distributed resources, data locality can be crucial to high throughput and performance. We propose a "data diffusion" approach that acquires compute and storage resources dynamically, replicates data in response to demand, and schedules computations close to data. As demand increases, more resources are acquired, thus allowing faster response to subsequent requests that refer to the same data; when demand drops, resources are released. This approach can provide the benefits of dedicated hardware without the associated high costs, depending on workload and resource characteristics. The approach is reminiscent of cooperative caching, web-caching, and peer-to-peer storage systems, but addresses different application demands. Other data-aware scheduling approaches assume dedicated resources, which can be expensive and/or inefficient if load varies significantly. To explore the feasibility of the data diffusion approach, we have extended the Falkon resource provisioning and task scheduling system to support data caching and data-aware scheduling. Performance results from both micro-benchmarks and a large scale astronomy application demonstrate that our approach improves performance relative to alternative approaches, as well as provides improved scalability as aggregated I/O bandwidth scales linearly with the number of data cache nodes. 
0808.03547	Applications of computational invariant theory to Kobayashi hyperbolicity and to Green-Griffiths algebraic degeneracy	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Joel Merker	Abstract:  A major unsolved problem (according to Demailly 1997) towards the Kobayashi hyperbolicity conjecture in optimal degree is to understand jet differentials of germs of holomorphic discs that are invariant under any reparametrization of the source. The underlying group action is not reductive, but we provide a complete algorithm to generate all invariants, in arbitrary dimension n and for jets of arbitrary order k. Two main new situations are studied in great details. For jets of order 4 in dimension 4, we establish that the algebra of Demailly-Semple invariants is generated by 2835 polynomials, while the algebra of bi-invariants is generated by 16 mutually independent polynomials sharing 41 groebnerized syzygies. Nonconstant entire holomorphic curves valued in an algebraic 3-fold (resp. 4-fold) X^3 in P^4 (C) (resp. X^4 in P^5(C)) of degree d satisfy global differential equations as soon as d > 71 (resp. d > 258). A useful asymptotic formula for the Euler-Poincare characteristic of Schur bundles in terms of Giambelli's determinants is derived. For jets of order 5 in dimension 2, we establish that the algebra of Demailly-Semple invariants is generated by 56 polynomials, while the algebra of bi-invariants is generated by 17 mutually independent polynomials sharing 105 groebnerized syzygies. 
0808.03548	Realizing Fast, Scalable and Reliable Scientific Computations in Grid Environments	Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)	Authors:Yong Zhao, Ioan Raicu, Ian Foster, Mihael Hategan, Veronika Nefedova, Mike Wilde	Abstract:  The practical realization of managing and executing large scale scientific computations efficiently and reliably is quite challenging. Scientific computations often involve thousands or even millions of tasks operating on large quantities of data, such data are often diversely structured and stored in heterogeneous physical formats, and scientists must specify and run such computations over extended periods on collections of compute, storage and network resources that are heterogeneous, distributed and may change constantly. We present the integration of several advanced systems: Swift, Karajan, and Falkon, to address the challenges in running various large scale scientific applications in Grid environments. Swift is a parallel programming tool for rapid and reliable specification, execution, and management of large-scale science and engineering workflows. Swift consists of a simple scripting language called SwiftScript and a powerful runtime system that is based on the CoG Karajan workflow engine and integrates the Falkon light-weight task execution service that uses multi-level scheduling and a streamlined dispatcher. We showcase the scalability, performance and reliability of the integrated system using application examples drawn from astronomy, cognitive neuroscience and molecular dynamics, which all comprise large number of fine-grained jobs. We show that Swift is able to represent dynamic workflows whose structures can only be determined during runtime and reduce largely the code size of various workflow representations using SwiftScript; schedule the execution of hundreds of thousands of parallel computations via the Karajan engine; and achieve up to 90% reduction in execution time when compared to traditional batch schedulers. 
0808.03549	Some 6-dimensional Hamiltonian S^1 manifolds	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Dusa McDuff	Abstract:  In an earlier paper we explained how to convert the problem of symplectically embedding one 4-dimensional ellipsoid into another into the problem of embedding a certain set of disjoint balls into \CP^2 by using a new way to desingularize orbifold blow ups Z of the weighted projective space \CP^2_{1,m,n}. We now use a related method to construct symplectomorphisms of these spaces Z. This allows us to construct some well known Fano 3-folds (including the Mukai--Umemura 3-fold) in purely symplectic terms, using a classification by Tolman of a particular class of Hamiltonian S^1-manifolds. We also show that these manifolds are uniquely determined by their fixed point data up to equivariant symplectomorphism. As part of this argument we show that the symplectomorphism group of a certain weighted blow up of a weighted projective plane is connected. 
0808.03550	Infinite divisibility of Smith matrices	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Shaofang Hong	Abstract:  Given an arithmetical function $f$, by $f(a, b)$ and $f[a, b]$ we denote the function $f$ evaluated at the greatest common divisor $(a, b)$ of positive integers $a$ and $b$ and evaluated at the least common multiple $[a, b]$ respectively. A positive semi-definite matrix $A=(a_{ij})$ with $a_{ij}\ge 0$ for all $i$ and $j$ is called infinitely divisible if the fractional Hadamard power $A^{\circ r}=(a_{ij}^r)$ is positive semi-definite for every nonnegative real number $r$. Let $S=\{x_1, ..., x_n\}$ be a set of $n$ distinct positive integers. In this paper, we show that if $f$ is a multiplicative function such that $(f*μ)(d)\ge 0$ whenever $d|x$ for any $x\in S$, then the $n\times n$ matrices $(f(x_i, x_j))$, $(\frac{1}{f[x_i, x_j]})$ and $(\frac{f(x_i, x_j)}{f[x_i, x_j]})$ are infinitely divisible. Finally we extend these results to the Dirichlet convolution case which produces infinitely many examples of infinitely divisible matrices. Our results extend the results obtained previously by Bourque, Ligh, Bhatia, Hong, Lee, Lindqvist and Seip. 
0808.03551	Charged Higgs bosons in Minimal Supersymmetry: Updated constraints and experimental prospects	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:D. Eriksson, F. Mahmoudi, O. Stål	Abstract:  We discuss the phenomenology of charged Higgs bosons in the MSSM with minimal flavor violation. In addition to the constrained MSSM (CMSSM) with universal soft supersymmetry breaking mass parameters at the GUT scale, we explore non-universal Higgs mass models (NUHM) where this universality condition is relaxed. To identify the allowed parameter space regions, we apply constraints from direct searches, low energy observables, and cosmology. We find that values of the charged Higgs mass as low as $m_{H^+}\simeq~135$ GeV can be accommodated in the NUHM models, but that several flavor physics observables disfavor large $H^+$ contributions, associated with high $\tanβ$, quite independently of MSSM scenario. We confront the constrained scenarios with the discovery potentials reported by ATLAS and CMS, and find that the current exclusion by indirect constraints is similar to the expected LHC discovery reach with 30 fb$^{-1}$ of data. Finally, we evaluate the sensitivity of the presented discovery potential to the choice of MSSM benchmark scenario. This sensitivity is found to be higher in the case of a light ($m_{H^+}<m_t$) charged Higgs. 
0808.03552	Dynamical thermalization and vortex formation in stirred 2D Bose-Einstein condensates	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:T. M. Wright, R. J. Ballagh, A. S. Bradley, P. B. Blakie, C. W. Gardiner	Abstract:  We present a quantum mechanical treatment of the mechanical stirring of Bose-Einstein condensates using classical field techniques. In our approach the condensate and excited modes are described using a Hamiltonian classical field method in which the atom number and (rotating frame) energy are strictly conserved. We simulate a T = 0 quasi-2D condensate perturbed by a rotating anisotropic trapping potential. Vacuum fluctuations in the initial state provide an irreducible mechanism for breaking the initial symmetries of the condensate and seeding the subsequent dynamical instability. Highly turbulent motion develops and we quantify the emergence of a rotating thermal component that provides the dissipation necessary for the nucleation and motional-damping of vortices in the condensate. Vortex lattice formation is not observed, rather the vortices assemble into a spatially disordered vortex liquid state. We discuss methods we have developed to identify the condensate in the presence of an irregular distribution of vortices, determine the thermodynamic parameters of the thermal component, and extract damping rates from the classical field trajectories. 
0808.03553	Graphene nanodevices: bridging nanoelectronics and subwavelength optics	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Pierre Darancet, Valerio Olevano, Didier Mayou	Abstract:  The unconventional properties of graphene, with a massless Dirac band dispersion and large coherence properties, have raised a large interest for applications in nanoelectronics. In this work, we emphasize that graphene two dimensional character combined with current standard lithography processes allow to achieve devices smaller than the Dirac electrons wavelength. In this regime, we demonstrate that the electronic properties present deep analogies with subwavelength optics phenomena. We describe the rich transport physics in graphene-based nanodevices through optical analogies: From the Bethe and Kirchhoff-like diffraction patterns in the conductance of graphene slits to the Fabry-Perot oscillations of the conductance in nanoribbons. We introduce the concept of {\it electronic diffraction barriers}, which transmission cancels at the Dirac point. This gives central insight in the properties of Graphene subwavelength devices including nanoelectronics standard systems, such as quantum dots. As an application we propose a new type of quantum dots, namely functionalized subwavelength quantum dots, which could be used as molecular spin valves. 
0808.03554	LTB solutions in Newtonian gauge: from strong to weak fields	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Karel Van Acoleyen	Abstract:  Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) solutions are used frequently to describe the collapse or expansion of spherically symmetric inhomogeneous mass distributions in the Universe. These exact solutions are obtained in the synchronous gauge where nonlinear dynamics (with respect to the FLRW background) induce large deviations from the FLRW metric. In this paper we show explicitly that this is a gauge artefact (for realistic sub-horizon inhomogeneities). We write down the nonlinear gauge transformation from synchronous to Newtonian gauge for a general LTB solution using the fact that the peculiar velocities are small. In the latter gauge we recover the solution in the form of a weakly perturbed FLRW metric that is assumed in standard cosmology. Furthermore we show how to obtain the LTB solutions directly in Newtonian gauge and illustrate how the Newtonian approximation remains valid in the nonlinear regime where cosmological perturbation theory breaks down. Finally we discuss the implications of our results for the backreaction scenario. 
0808.03555	A Catastrophe-Theoretic Approach to Tricritical Points with Application to Liquid Crystals	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Livio Gibelli, Stefano Turzi	Abstract:  A criterion to locate tricritical points in phase diagrams is proposed. The criterion is formulated in the framework of the Elementary Catastrophe Theory and encompasses all the existing criteria in that it applies to systems described by a generally non symmetric free energy which can depend on one or more order parameters. We show that a tricritical point is given whenever the free energy is not 4-determined. An application to smectic-C liquid crystals is briefly discussed. 
0808.03556	Dynamical mass of a star cluster in M83: a test of fibre-fed multi-object spectroscopy	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:SL Moll (Sheffield), R de Grijs, P Anders, PA Crowther, SS Larsen, LJ Smith, SF Portegies Zwart	Abstract:  (Abridged) Aims: We obtained VLT/FLAMES+UVES high-resolution, fibre-fed spectroscopy (FFS) of five young massive clusters in M83 (NGC 5236). This forms the basis of a pilot study testing the feasibility of using FFS to measure the velocity dispersions of several clusters simultaneously, in order to determine their dynamical masses; Methods: We adopted two methods for determining the velocity dispersion of the star clusters: cross-correlating the cluster spectrum with the template spectra and minimising a chi^2 value between the cluster spectrum and the broadened template spectra. Cluster 805 in M83 was chosen as a control to test the reliability of the method, through a comparison with the results obtained from a standard echelle VLT/UVES spectrum obtained by Larsen & Richtler; Results: We find no dependence of the velocity dispersions measured for a cluster on the choice of red giant versus red supergiant templates, nor on the method adopted. We measure a velocity dispersion of sigma_los = 10.2+/-1.1 km/s for cluster 805 from our FFS. Our FLAMES+UVES velocity dispersion measurement gives M_vir = (6.6+/-1.7)e5 M_sun, consistent with previous results. This is a factor of ~3 greater than the cluster's photometric mass, indicating a lack of virial equilibrium. However, based on its effective star formation efficiency, the cluster is likely to virialise, and may survive for a Hubble time, in the absence of external disruptive forces; Conclusions: We find that reliable velocity dispersions can be determined from FFS. The advantages of observing several clusters simultaneously outweighs the difficulty of accurate galaxy background subtraction, providing that the targets are chosen to provide sufficient S/N ratios, and are much brighter than the galaxy background. 
0808.03557	High CO tolerance of Pt/Ru nano-catalyst: insight from first principles calculation	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Sergey Stolbov, Marisol Alcantara Ortigoza, Radoslav Adzic, Talat S. Rahman	Abstract:  Density functional theory based calculations of the energetics of adsorption and diffusion of CO on Pt islets and on the Ru(0001) substrate show that CO has the lowest adsorption energy at the center of the islet, and its bonding increases as it moves to the edge of the island and further onto the substrate. Activation energy barriers for CO diffusion from the islet to the Ru surface are found to be lower than 0.3 eV making the process feasible and leading to the conclusion that this hydrogen oxidation catalyst is CO tolerant because of the spillover of CO from active Pt sites to the Ru substrate. We present the rationale for this effect using insights from detailed electronic structure calculations.

0808.03559	Basic parameters of three star clusters in the Small Magellanic Cloud: Kron 11, Kron 63 and NGC 121	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:G. Baume, N.E.D. Noël, E. Costa, G. Carraro, R.A. Méndez, M.H. Pedreros	Abstract:  We present observations for three star clusters, Kron 11, Kron 63 and NGC 121, in the Small Magellanic Cloud. We have studied their structure and derived their fundamental parameters by means of their luminosity functions, their color magnitude diagrams and the Padova suite of isochrones. NGC 121 is a well studied object, for which we confirm previous evidence about its old age and low metal content, and have found that it is undergoing mass segregation. Kron 11 and Kron 63 are poorly populated clusters which had never been studied so far. Kron 11 is several gigayears younger than NGC 121, while Kron 63 is basically a very young star aggregate. Both clusters are immersed in dense stellar fields which share the same population properties, suggesting that in their cases, cluster ages are consistent with typical ages of field stars. 
0808.03560	In search of RR Lyrae type stars in eclipsing binary systems. OGLE052218.07-692827.4: an optical blend	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Prsa, E. F. Guinan, E. J. Devinney, S. G. Engle	Abstract:  During the OGLE-2 operation, Soszynski et al. (2003) found 3 LMC candidates for an RR Lyr-type component in an eclipsing binary system. Two of those have orbital periods that are too short to be physically plausible and hence have to be optical blends. For the third, OGLE052218.07-692827.4, we developed a model of the binary that could host the observed RR Lyr star. After being granted HST/WFPC2 time, however, we were able to resolve 5 distinct sources within a 1.3" region that is typical of OGLE resolution, proving that OGLE052218.07-692827.4 is also an optical blend. Moreover, the putative eclipsing binary signature found in the OGLE data does not seem to correspond to a physically plausible system; the source is likely another background RR Lyr star. There are still no RR Lyr stars discovered so far in an eclipsing binary system. 
0808.03561	Mapping the Asymmetric Thick Disk: The Hercules Thick Disk Cloud	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jeffrey A. Larsen, Roberta M. Humphreys, Juan E. Cabanela	Abstract:  The stellar asymmetry of faint thick disk/inner halo stars in the first quadrant first reported by Larsen & Humphreys (1996) and investigated further by Parker et al. (2003, 2004) has been recently confirmed by SDSS (Juric et al. 2008). Their interpretation of the excess in the star counts as a ringlike structure, however, is not supported by critical complimentary data in the fourth quadrant not covered by SDSS. We present stellar density maps from the Minnesota Automated Plate Scanner (MAPS) Catalog of the POSS I showing that the overdensity does not extend into the fourth quadrant. The overdensity is most probably not a ring. It could be due to interaction with the disk bar, evidence for a triaxial thick disk, or a merger remnant/stream. We call this feature the Hercules Thick Disk Cloud. 
0808.03562	Minimal Agent Based Model for Financial Markets I: Origin and Self-Organization of Stylized Facts	Trading and Market Microstructure (q-fin.TR)	Authors:V. Alfi, M. Cristelli, L. Pietronero, A. Zaccaria	Abstract:  We introduce a minimal Agent Based Model for financial markets to understand the nature and Self-Organization of the Stylized Facts. The model is minimal in the sense that we try to identify the essential ingredients to reproduce the main most important deviations of price time series from a Random Walk behavior. We focus on four essential ingredients: fundamentalist agents which tend to stabilize the market; chartist agents which induce destabilization; analysis of price behavior for the two strategies; herding behavior which governs the possibility of changing strategy. Bubbles and crashes correspond to situations dominated by chartists, while fundamentalists provide a long time stability (on average). The Stylized Facts are shown to correspond to an intermittent behavior which occurs only for a finite value of the number of agents N. Therefore they correspond to finite size effect which, however, can occur at different time scales. We propose a new mechanism for the Self-Organization of this state which is linked to the existence of a threshold for the agents to be active or not active. The feedback between price fluctuations and number of active agents represent a crucial element for this state of Self-Organized-Intermittency. The model can be easily generalized to consider more realistic variants. 
0808.03563	What It Feels Like To Hear Voices: Fond Memories of Julian Jaynes	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	Authors:Stevan Harnad	Abstract:  Julian Jaynes's profound humanitarian convictions not only prevented him from going to war, but would have prevented him from ever kicking a dog. Yet according to his theory, not only are language-less dogs unconscious, but so too were the speaking/hearing Greeks in the Bicameral Era, when they heard gods' voices telling them what to do rather than thinking for themselves. I argue that to be conscious is to be able to feel, and that all mammals (and probably lower vertebrates and invertebrates too) feel, hence are conscious. Julian Jaynes's brilliant analysis of our concepts of consciousness nevertheless keeps inspiring ever more inquiry and insights into the age-old mind/body problem and its relation to cognition and language. 
0808.03564	Storm fronts over galaxy discs: Models of how waves generate extraplanar gas and its anomalous kinematics	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Curtis Struck (Iowa State), Daniel C. Smith (APL-JHU)    	Abstract:  The existence of partially ionized, diffuse gas and dust clouds at kiloparsec scale distances above the central planes of edge-on, galaxy discs was an unexpected discovery about 20 yrs ago. Subsequent observations showed that this EDIG (extended or extraplanar diffuse interstellar gas) has rotation velocities approximately 10-20% lower than those in the central plane, and have been hard to account for. Here we present results of hydrodynamic models, with radiative cooling and heating from star formation. We find that in models with star formation generated stochastically across the disc an extraplanar gas layer is generated as long as the star formation is sufficiently strong. However, this gas rotates at nearly the same speed as the mid-plane gas. We then studied a range of models with imposed spiral or bar waves in the disc. EDIG layers were also generated in these models, but primarily over the wave regions, not over the entire disc. Because of this partial coverage, the EDIG clouds move radially, as well as vertically, with the result that observed kinematic anomalies are reproduced. The implication is that the kinematic anomalies are the result of three-dimensional motions when the cylindrical symmetry of the disc is broken. Thus, the kinematic anomalies are the result of bars or strong waves, and more face-on galaxies with such waves should have an asymmetric EDIG component. The models also indicate that the EDIG can contain a significant fraction of cool gas, and that some star formation can be triggered at considerable heights above the disc midplane. We expect all of these effects to be more prominent in young, forming discs, to play a role in rapidly smoothing disc asymmetries, and in working to self-regulate disc structure. 
0808.03565	Minimal Agent Based Model for Financial Markets II: Statistical Properties of the Linear and Multiplicative Dynamics	Trading and Market Microstructure (q-fin.TR)	Authors:V. Alfi, M. Cristelli, L.Pietronero, A. Zaccaria	Abstract:  We present a detailed study of the statistical properties of an Agent Based Model and of its generalization to the multiplicative dynamics. The aim of the model is to consider the minimal elements for the understanding of the origin of the Stylized Facts and their Self-Organization. The key elements are fundamentalist agents, chartist agents, herding dynamics and price behavior. The first two elements correspond to the competition between stability and instability tendencies in the market. The herding behavior governs the possibility of the agents to change strategy and it is a crucial element of this class of models. The linear approximation permits a simple interpretation of the model dynamics and, for many properties, it is possible to derive analytical results. The generalized non linear dynamics results to be extremely more sensible to the parameter space and much more difficult to analyze and control. The main results for the nature and Self-Organization of the Stylized Facts are, however, very similar in the two cases. The main peculiarity of the non linear dynamics is an enhancement of the fluctuations and a more marked evidence of the Stylized Facts. We will also discuss some modifications of the model to introduce more realistic elements with respect to the real markets. 
0808.03566	How and why to think about scattering in terms of wave packets instead of plane waves	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Travis Norsen, Joshua Lande, S. B. McKagan	Abstract:  We discuss "the plane wave approximation" to quantum mechanical scattering using simple one-dimensional examples. The central points of the paper are that (a) plane waves should be thought of as infinitely wide wave packets, and (b) the calculations of reflection and transmission probabilities $R$ and $T$ in standard textbook presentations involve an approximation which is almost never discussed. We argue that it should be discussed explicitly, and that doing so provides a simple and intuitively revealing alternative way to derive and understand certain formulas. Using an under-appreciated exact expression for wave packet scattering probabilities, we calculate, for two standard examples, expressions for $R$ and $T$ for an incident Gaussian wave packet. Comparing these results to the corresponding ones calculated using the plane wave approximation helps illuminate the domain of applicability of that approximation. 
0808.03567	Symmetric Spaces in Supergravity	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:S. Ferrara, A. Marrani	Abstract:  We exploit the relation among irreducible Riemannian globally symmetric spaces (IRGS) and supergravity theories in 3, 4 and 5 space-time dimensions. IRGS appear as scalar manifolds of the theories, as well as moduli spaces of the various classes of solutions to the classical extremal black hole Attractor Equations. Relations with Jordan algebras of degree three and four are also outlined. 
0808.03568	NB BLG model in N=8 superfields	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Igor A. Bandos	Abstract:  We develop the N=8 superfield description of the Bagger-Lambert-Gustavsson (BLG) model in its Nambu bracket (NB) realization. The basic ingredient is the octet of scalar d=3 N=8 superfields depending also on the coordinates of a compact three dimensional space M. It is restricted by the 'superembedding-like' equation, which can be treated as covariantization of the linearized superembedding equation for supermembrane (M2-brane) with respect volume preserving diffeomorphisms SDiff3 of M. The curvatures of SDiff3 connection are expressed through the scalar superfields by the N=8 superfield generalization of the Chern-Simons equation (super-CS equation). We show how the dynamical BLG equations appear when studying consistency of these basic equations. 
0808.03569	Offloading Cognition onto Cognitive Technology	Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)	Authors:Itiel Dror, Stevan Harnad	Abstract:  "Cognizing" (e.g., thinking, understanding, and knowing) is a mental state. Systems without mental states, such as cognitive technology, can sometimes contribute to human cognition, but that does not make them cognizers. Cognizers can offload some of their cognitive functions onto cognitive technology, thereby extending their performance capacity beyond the limits of their own brain power. Language itself is a form of cognitive technology that allows cognizers to offload some of their cognitive functions onto the brains of other cognizers. Language also extends cognizers' individual and joint performance powers, distributing the load through interactive and collaborative cognition. Reading, writing, print, telecommunications and computing further extend cognizers' capacities. And now the web, with its network of cognizers, digital databases and software agents, all accessible anytime, anywhere, has become our 'Cognitive Commons,' in which distributed cognizers and cognitive technology can interoperate globally with a speed, scope and degree of interactivity inconceivable through local individual cognition alone. And as with language, the cognitive tool par excellence, such technological changes are not merely instrumental and quantitative: they can have profound effects on how we think and encode information, on how we communicate with one another, on our mental states, and on our very nature. 
0808.03570	Algèbres enveloppantes à homotopie près, homologie et cohomologie	Quantum Algebra (math.QA)	Authors:Ridha Chatbouri	Abstract:  We present an unified construction for algebras and modules homologies and cohomologies, in the case of associative, commuttaive, Lie and Gerstenhaber algebras. We make a distinction between the linear part of the construction of algebras and cogebras, characterized by the symmetries of the defining relations and the structure itself which appears as a differential on these algebras and cogebras. 
0808.03571	MHS sunspot model from deep sub-photospheric to chromospheric layers	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:E. Khomenko, M. Collados	Abstract:  In order to understand the influence of magnetic fields on the propagation properties of waves, as derived from different local helioseismology techniques, forward modeling of waves is required. Such calculations need a model in magnetohydrostatic equilibrium as initial atmosphere to propagate oscillations through it. We provide a method to construct such a model in equilibrium for a wide range of parameters to be used for simulations of artificial helioseismologic data. The method combine the advantages of self-similar solutions and current-distributed models. A set of models is developed by numerical integration of magnetohydrostatic equations from the sub-photospheric to chromospheric layers. 
0808.03572	Model-Based Compressive Sensing	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Richard G. Baraniuk, Volkan Cevher, Marco F. Duarte, Chinmay Hegde	Abstract:  Compressive sensing (CS) is an alternative to Shannon/Nyquist sampling for the acquisition of sparse or compressible signals that can be well approximated by just K << N elements from an N-dimensional basis. Instead of taking periodic samples, CS measures inner products with M < N random vectors and then recovers the signal via a sparsity-seeking optimization or greedy algorithm. Standard CS dictates that robust signal recovery is possible from M = O(K log(N/K)) measurements. It is possible to substantially decrease M without sacrificing robustness by leveraging more realistic signal models that go beyond simple sparsity and compressibility by including structural dependencies between the values and locations of the signal coefficients. This paper introduces a model-based CS theory that parallels the conventional theory and provides concrete guidelines on how to create model-based recovery algorithms with provable performance guarantees. A highlight is the introduction of a new class of structured compressible signals along with a new sufficient condition for robust structured compressible signal recovery that we dub the restricted amplification property, which is the natural counterpart to the restricted isometry property of conventional CS. Two examples integrate two relevant signal models - wavelet trees and block sparsity - into two state-of-the-art CS recovery algorithms and prove that they offer robust recovery from just M=O(K) measurements. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the validity and applicability of our new theory and algorithms. 
0808.03573	Early-type galaxies in the near-infrared: 1.5-2.4\mum spectroscopy	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Cesetti, V. D. Ivanov, L. Morelli, A. Pizzella, L. Buson, E. M. Corsini, E. Dalla Bontà, M. Stiavelli, F. Bertola	Abstract:  Near-infrared (hereafter NIR) data may provide complementary information to the traditional optical population synthesis analysis of unresolved stellar populations because the spectral energy distribution of the galaxies in the 1-2.5\mum range is dominated by different types of stars than at optical wavelengths. Furthermore, NIR data are subjected to less absorption and hence could constrain the stellar populations in dust-obscured galaxies. We want to develop observational constraints on the stellar populations of unresolved stellar systems in the NIR. To achieve this goal we need a benchmark sample of NIR spectra of ``simple'' early-type galaxies, to be used for testing and calibrating the outputs of population synthesis models. We obtained low-resolution (R~1000) long-slit spectra between 1.5 and 2.4\mum for 14 nearby early-type galaxies using SofI at NTT and higher resolution (R~3000) long-slit spectra, centered at the MgI at ~1.51\mum for a heterogeneous sample of 5 nearby galaxies observed with ISAAC at VLT. We defined spectral indices for CO, NaI, CaI and MgI features and measured the strengths of these features in the sample galaxies. We defined a new global NIR metallicity index, suitable for abundance measurements in low-resolution spectra. Finally, we present an average NIR spectrum of an early-type galaxy, built from a homogenized subset of our sample. The NIR spectra of the sample galaxies show great similarity and the strength of some features does correlate with the iron abundance [Fe/H] and optical metal features of the galaxies. The data suggest that the NIR metal features, in combination with a hydrogen absorption feature may be able to break the age-metallicity degeneracy just like the Mg and Fe features in the optical wavelength range. 
0808.03574	Classical Knowledge for Quantum Security	Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)	Authors:Ellie D'Hondt, Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh	Abstract:  We propose a decision procedure for analysing security of quantum cryptographic protocols, combining a classical algebraic rewrite system for knowledge with an operational semantics for quantum distributed computing. As a test case, we use our procedure to reason about security properties of a recently developed quantum secret sharing protocol that uses graph states. We analyze three different scenarios based on the safety assumptions of the classical and quantum channels and discover the path of an attack in the presence of an adversary. The epistemic analysis that leads to this and similar types of attacks is purely based on our classical notion of knowledge. 
0808.03575	Hamiltonian thermodynamics of charged three-dimensional dilatonic black holes	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Gonçalo A. S. Dias, José P. S. Lemos	Abstract:  The action for a class of three-dimensional dilaton-gravity theories, with an electromagnetic Maxwell field and a cosmological constant, can be recast in a Brans-Dicke-Maxwell type action, with its free $ω$ parameter. For a negative cosmological constant, these theories have static, electrically charged, and spherically symmetric black hole solutions. Those theories with well formulated asymptotics are studied through a Hamiltonian formalism, and their thermodynamical properties are found. The theories studied are general relativity, a dimensionally reduced cylindrical four-dimensional general relativity theory, and a theory representing a class of theories, all with a Maxwell term. The Hamiltonian formalism is setup in three dimensions through foliations on the right region of the Carter-Penrose diagram, with the bifurcation 1-sphere as the left boundary, and anti-de Sitter infinity as the right one. The metric functions on the hypersurfaces and the radial component of the vector potential one-form are the canonical coordinates. The Hamiltonian action is written, the Hamiltonian being a sum of constraints. One finds a new action which yields an unconstrained theory with two pairs of canonical coordinates ${M,P_M; Q,P_Q}$, where $M$ is the mass parameter, which needs renormalization, $P_M$ its conjugate momenta, $Q$ is the charge parameter, and $P_Q$ its conjugate momentum. The resulting Hamiltonian is a sum of boundary terms only. A quantization of the theory is performed. The Schrödinger evolution operator is constructed, the trace is taken, and the partition function of the grand canonical ensemble is obtained, the chemical potential being the electric potential. The charged black hole entropies differ, in general, from the usual quarter of the horizon area due to the dilaton. 
0808.03576	Zero temperature phase diagram of a d-wave superconductor with Anderson impurities	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:L. S. Borkowski	Abstract:  We study the model of a d-wave superconductor interacting with finite concentration of Anderson impurities at zero temperature. The interaction between impurity and conduction electrons is taken into account within the large-$N$ approximation. We discuss the obtained phase diagram and its dependence on the main energy scales. 
0808.03577	Singular reduction operators in two dimensions	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Michael Kunzinger, Roman O. Popovych	Abstract:  The notion of singular reduction operators, i.e., of singular operators of nonclassical (conditional) symmetry, of partial differential equations in two independent variables is introduced. All possible reductions of these equations to first-order ODEs are are exhaustively described. As examples, properties of singular reduction operators of (1+1)-dimensional evolution and wave equations are studied. It is shown how to favourably enhance the derivation of nonclassical symmetries for this class by an in-depth prior study of the corresponding singular vector fields. 
0808.03578	A New Moment Method for Continuum Radiative Transfer in Cosmological Reionization	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:K. Finlator, F. Ozel, R. Dave	Abstract:  We introduce a new code for computing time-dependent continuum radiative transfer and non-equilibrium ionization states in static density fields with periodic boundaries. Our code solves the moments of the radiative transfer equation, closed by an Eddingtion tensor computed using a long characteristics method. We show that pure (i.e., not source-centered) short characteristics and the optically-thin approximation are inappropriate for computing Eddington factors for the problem of cosmological reionization. We evolve the non-equilibrium ionization field via an efficient and accurate (errors <1%) technique that switches between fully implicit or explicit finite-differencing depending on whether the local timescales are long or short compared to the timestep. We tailor our code for the problem of cosmological reionization. In tests, the code conserves photons, accurately treats cosmological effects, and reproduces analytic Stromgren sphere solutions. Its chief weakness is that the computation time for the long characteristics calculation scales relatively poorly compared to other techniques (t_{LC} \propto N_{cells}^1.5); however, we mitigate this by only recomputing the Eddington tensor when the radiation field changes substantially. Our technique makes almost no physical approximations, so it provides a way to benchmark faster but more approximate techniques. It can readily be extended to evolve multiple frequencies, though we do not do so here. Finally, we note that our method is generally applicable to any problem involving the transfer of continuum radiation through a periodic volume. 
0808.03579	High accretion rates in magnetised Keplerian discs mediated by a Parker instability driven dynamo	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Anders Johansen (1), Yuri Levin (1) ((1) Leiden Observatory, Leiden University)    	Abstract:  Hydromagnetic stresses in accretion discs have been the subject of intense theoretical research over the past one and a half decades. Most of the disc simulations have assumed a small initial magnetic field and studied the turbulence that arises from the magnetorotational instability. However, gaseous discs in galactic nuclei and in some binary systems are likely to have significant initial magnetisation. Motivated by this, we performed ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of strongly magnetised, vertically stratified discs in a Keplerian potential. Our initial equilibrium configuration, which has an azimuthal magnetic field in equipartion with thermal pressure, is unstable to the Parker instability. This leads to the expelling of magnetic field arcs, anchored in the midplane of the disc, to around five scale heights from the midplane. Transition to turbulence happens primarily through magnetorotational instability in the resulting vertical fields, although magnetorotational shear instability in the unperturbed azimuthal field plays a significant role as well, especially in the midplane where buoyancy is weak. High magnetic and hydrodynamical stresses arise, yielding an effective $α$-value of around 0.1 in our highest resolution run. Azimuthal magnetic field expelled by magnetic buoyancy from the disc is continuously replenished by the stretching of a radial field created as gas parcels slide in the linear gravity field along inclined magnetic field lines. This dynamo process, where the bending of field lines by the Parker instability leads to re-creation of the azimuthal field, implies that highly magnetised discs are astrophysically viable and that they have high accretion rates. 
0808.03580	Modeling He-rich subdwarfs through the hot-flasher Scenario	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. M. Miller Bertolami, L. G. Althaus, K. Unglaub, A. Weiss	Abstract:  We present 1D numerical simulations aimed at studying the hot-flasher scenario for the formation of He-rich subdwarf stars. Sequences were calculated for a wide range of metallicities and physical assumptions, such as the stellar mass at the moment of the helium core flash. This allows us to study the two previously proposed flavors of the hot-flasher scenario ("deep" and "shallow" mixing cases) and to identify a third transition type. Our sequences are calculated by solving simultaneously the mixing and burning equations within a diffusive convection picture, and in the context of standard mixing length theory. We are able to follow chemical evolution during deep-mixing events in which hydrogen is burned violently, and therefore able to present a homogeneous set of abundances for different metallicities and varieties of hot-flashers. We extend the scope of our work by analyzing the effects of non-standard assumptions, such as the effect of chemical gradients, extra-mixing at convective boundaries, possible reduction in convective velocities, or the interplay between difussion and mass loss. Particular emphasis is placed on the predicted surface properties of the models. We find that the hot-flasher scenario is a viable explanation for the formation and surface properties of He-sdO stars. Our results also show that, during the early He-core burning stage, element diffusion may produce the transformation of (post hot-flasher) He-rich atmospheres into He-deficient ones. If this is so, then we find that He-sdO stars should be the progenitors of some of the hottest sdB stars. 
0808.03581	Supersonic quantum communication	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:J. Eisert, D. Gross	Abstract:  When locally exciting a quantum lattice model, the excitation will propagate through the lattice. The effect is responsible for a wealth of non-equilibrium phenomena, and has been exploited to transmit quantum information through spin chains. It is a commonly expressed belief that for local Hamiltonians, any such propagation happens at a finite "speed of sound". Indeed, the Lieb-Robinson theorem states that in spin models, all effects caused by a perturbation are limited to a causal cone defined by a constant speed, up to exponentially small corrections. In this work we show that for translationally invariant bosonic models with nearest-neighbor interactions, this belief is incorrect: We prove that one can encounter excitations which accelerate under the natural dynamics of the lattice and allow for reliable transmission of information faster than any finite speed of sound. The effect is only limited by the model's range of validity (eventually by relativity). It also implies that in non-equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated bosonic models far-away regions may become quickly entangled, suggesting that their simulation may be much harder than that of spin chains even in the low energy sector. 
0808.03582	CARMA Millimeter-Wave Aperture Synthesis Imaging of the HD 32297 Debris Disk	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:H. L. Maness, M. P. Fitzgerald, R. Paladini, P. Kalas, G. Duchene, James R. Graham	Abstract:  We present the first detection and mapping of the HD 32297 debris disk at 1.3 mm with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). With a sub-arcsecond beam, this detection represents the highest angular resolution (sub)mm debris disk observation made to date. Our model fits to the spectral energy distribution from the CARMA flux and new Spitzer MIPS photometry support the earlier suggestion that at least two, possibly three, distinct grain populations are traced by the current data. The observed millimeter map shows an asymmetry between the northeast and southwest disk lobes, suggesting large grains may be trapped in resonance with an unseen exoplanet. Alternatively, the observed morphology could result from the recent breakup of a massive planetesimal. A similar-scale asymmetry is also observed in scattered light but not in the mid-infrared. This contrast between asymmetry at short and long wavelengths and symmetry at intermediate wavelengths is in qualitative agreement with predictions of resonant debris disk models. With resolved observations in several bands spanning over three decades in wavelength, HD 32297 provides a unique testbed for theories of grain and planetary dynamics, and could potentially provide strong multi-wavelength evidence for an exoplanetary system. 
0808.03583	Testing non-standard CP violation in neutrino propagation	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Walter Winter	Abstract:  Non-standard physics which can be described by effective four fermion interactions may be an additional source of CP violation in the neutrino propagation. We discuss the detectability of such a CP violation at a neutrino factory. We assume the current baseline setup of the international design study of a neutrino factory (IDS-NF) for the simulation. We find that the CP violation from certain non-standard interactions is, in principle, detectable significantly below their current bounds -- even if there is no CP violation in the standard oscillation framework. Therefore, a new physics effect might be mis-interpreted as the canonical Dirac CP violation, and a possibly even more exciting effect might be missed.

Hauschildt (3) ((1) Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics, University of Toronto, (2) Stockholm Observatory, AlbaNova University Centre, (3) Hamburger Sternwarte)    	Abstract:  We estimate cluster ages from lithium depletion in five pre-main-sequence groups found within 100 pc of the Sun: TW Hydrae Association, Eta Chamaeleontis Cluster, Beta Pictoris Moving Group, Tucanae-Horologium Association and AB Doradus Moving Group. We determine surface gravities, effective temperatures and lithium abundances for over 900 spectra through least squares fitting to model-atmosphere spectra. For each group, we compare the dependence of lithium abundance on temperature with isochrones from pre-main-sequence evolutionary tracks to obtain model dependent ages. We find that the Eta Chamaelontis Cluster and the TW Hydrae Association are the youngest, with ages of 12+/-6 Myr and 12+/-8 Myr, respectively, followed by the Beta Pictoris Moving Group at 21+/-9 Myr, the Tucanae-Horologium Association at 27+/-11 Myr, and the AB Doradus Moving Group at an age of at least 45 Myr (where we can only set a lower limit since the models -- unlike real stars -- do not show much lithium depletion beyond this age). Here, the ordering is robust, but the precise ages depend on our choice of both atmospheric and evolutionary models. As a result, while our ages are consistent with estimates based on Hertzsprung-Russell isochrone fitting and dynamical expansion, they are not yet more precise. Our observations do show that with improved models, much stronger constraints should be feasible: the intrinsic uncertainties, as measured from the scatter between measurements from different spectra of the same star, are very low: around 10 K in effective temperature, 0.05 dex in surface gravity, and 0.03 dex in lithium abundance. 
0808.03585	On the mechanism for orbital-ordering in KCuF3	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:E. Pavarini, E. Koch, A. I. Lichtenstein	Abstract:  The Mott insulating perovskite KCuF3 is considered the archetype of an orbitally-ordered system. By using the LDA+dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) method, we investigate the mechanism for orbital-ordering (OO) in this material. We show that the purely electronic Kugel-Khomskii super-exchange mechanism (KK) alone leads to a remarkably large transition temperature of T_KK about 350 K. However, orbital-order is experimentally believed to persist to at least 800 K. Thus Jahn-Teller distortions are essential for stabilizing orbital-order at such high temperatures. 
0808.03586	Time-dependent and time-integrated angular analysis of $B\toφK^0_Sπ^0$ and $φK^\pmπ^\mp$	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:The BABAR Collaboration: B. Aubert, et al    	Abstract:  We perform a time-dependent and time-integrated angular analysis of the decays $B^0\toφK^{*}(892)^0$, $φK^{*}_2(1430)^0$, and $φ(Kπ)^{*0}_{0}$ with the final sample of about 465 million $\BB$ pairs recorded with the $\babar$ detector. Twenty-four parameters are investigated, including the branching fractions, CP-violation parameters, and parameters sensitive to final-state interactions. We use the dependence on the $Kπ$ invariant mass of the interference between the scalar and vector or tensor components to resolve discrete ambiguities of the strong and weak phases. We use the time-evolution of the $B\toφK^0_Sπ^0$ channel to extract the CP-violation phase difference $Δφ_{00}=0.28\pm0.42\pm 0.04$ between the $B$ and $\Bbar$ decay amplitudes. When the $B\toφK^\pmπ^\mp$ channel is included, the fractions of longitudinal polarization ${f_L}$ of the vector-vector and vector-tensor decay modes are measured to be $0.494\pm0.034\pm0.013$ and $0.901^{+0.046}_{-0.058}\pm 0.037$, respectively. This polarization pattern requires the presence of a positive-helicity amplitude in the vector-vector decay from a currently unknown source. 
0808.03587	Formal and Informal Model Selection with Incomplete Data	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:Geert Verbeke, Geert Molenberghs, Caroline Beunckens	Abstract:  Model selection and assessment with incomplete data pose challenges in addition to the ones encountered with complete data. There are two main reasons for this. First, many models describe characteristics of the complete data, in spite of the fact that only an incomplete subset is observed. Direct comparison between model and data is then less than straightforward. Second, many commonly used models are more sensitive to assumptions than in the complete-data situation and some of their properties vanish when they are fitted to incomplete, unbalanced data. These and other issues are brought forward using two key examples, one of a continuous and one of a categorical nature. We argue that model assessment ought to consist of two parts: (i) assessment of a model's fit to the observed data and (ii) assessment of the sensitivity of inferences to unverifiable assumptions, that is, to how a model described the unobserved data given the observed ones. 
0808.03588	Discrete Affine Surfaces based on Quadrangular Meshes	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Marcos Craizer, Henri Anciaux, Thomas Lewiner	Abstract:  In this paper we are interested in defining affine structures on discrete quadrangular surfaces of the affine three-space. We introduce, in a constructive way, two classes of such surfaces, called respectively indefinite and definite surfaces. The underlying meshes for indefinite surfaces are asymptotic nets satisfying a non-degeneracy condition, while the underlying meshes for definite surfaces are non-degenerate conjugate nets satisfying a certain natural condition. In both cases we associate to any of these nets several discrete affine invariant quantities: a metric, a normal and a co-normal vector fields, and a mean curvature. Moreover, we derive structural and compatibility equations which are shown to be necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a discrete quadrangular surface with a given affine structure. 
0808.03589	Pattern selection in parametrically-driven arrays of nonlinear resonators	Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)	Authors:Eyal Kenig, Ron Lifshitz, M.C. Cross	Abstract:  We study the problem of pattern selection in an array of parametrically-driven nonlinear resonators with application to microelectromechanical and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS & NEMS), using an amplitude equation recently derived by Bromberg, Cross, and Lifshitz [PRE 73, 016214 (2006)]. We describe the transitions between standing-wave patterns of different wave numbers as the drive amplitude is varied either quasistatically, abruptly, or as a linear ramp in time. We find novel hysteretic effects, which are confirmed by numerical integration of the original equations of motion of the interacting nonlinear resonators. 
0808.03590	Painléve III and a singular linear statistics in Hermitian random matrix ensembles I	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Yang Chen, Alexander Its	Abstract:  In this paper, we study a certain linear statistics of the unitary Laguerre ensembles, motivated in part by an integrable quantum field theory at finite temperature. It transpires that this is equivalent to the characterization of a sequence of polynomials orthogonal with respect to the weight $$ w(x)=w(x,s):=x^{\al}\rme^{-x}\rme^{-s/x}, \quad 0\leq x<\infty, \al>0, s>0, $$ namely, the determination of the associated Hankel determinant and recurrence coefficients. Here $w(x,s)$ is the Laguerre weight $x^{\al}\:\rme^{-x}$ 'perturbed' by a multiplicative factor $\rme^{-s/x},$ which induces an infinitely strong zero at the origin. For polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle, a particular example where there are explicit formulas, the weight of which has infinitely strong zeros, was investigated by Pollazcek and Szegö many years ago. Such weights are said to be 'singular' or irregular due to the violation of the Szegö condition. In our problem, the linear statistics is a sum of the reciprocal of positive random variables $\{x_j:j=1,..,,n\};$ $\sum_{j=1}^{n}1/x_j.$ We show that the moment generating function, or the Laplace transform of the probability density function of this linear statistics is expressed as the ratio of Hankel determinants and as an integral of the combination of a particular third Painlevé function. 
0808.03591	Vector space bases associated to vanishing ideals of points	Commutative Algebra (math.AC)	Authors:Samuel Lundqvist	Abstract:  We discuss four different constructions of vector space bases associated to vanishing ideals of points. We show how to compute normal forms with respect to these bases and give new complexity bounds. As an application, we improve the computational algebra approach to the reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks. 
0808.03592	Magnetic field modification of ultracold molecule-molecule collisions	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:T. V. Tscherbul, Yu. V. Suleimanov, V. Aquilanti, R. V. Krems	Abstract:  We present an accurate quantum mechanical study of molecule-molecule collisions in the presence of a magnetic field. The work focusses on the analysis of elastic scattering and spin relaxation in collisions of O2(3Sigma_g) molecules at cold (~0.1 K) and ultracold (~10^{-6} K) temperatures. Our calculations show that magnetic spin relaxation in molecule-molecule collisions is extremely efficient except at magnetic fields below 1 mT. The rate constant for spin relaxation at T=0.1 K and a magnetic field of 0.1 T is found to be as large as 6.1 x 10^{-11} cm3/s. The magnetic field dependence of elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections at ultracold temperatures is dominated by a manifold of Feshbach resonances with the density of ~100 resonances per Tesla for collisions of molecules in the absolute ground state. This suggests that the scattering length of ultracold molecules in the absolute ground state can be effectively tuned in a very wide range of magnetic fields. Our calculations demonstrate that the number and properties of the magnetic Feshbach resonances are dramatically different for molecules in the absolute ground and excited spin states. The density of Feshbach resonances for molecule-molecule scattering in the low-field-seeking Zeeman state is reduced by a factor of 10. 
0808.03593	Remarks on KdV-type Flows on Star-Shaped Curves	Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)	Authors:Annalisa Calini, Thomas Ivey, Gloria Mari Beffa	Abstract:  We study the relation between the centro-affine geometry of star-shaped planar curves and the projective geometry of parametrized maps into $\RP^1$. We show that projectivization induces a map between differential invariants and a bi-Poisson map between Hamiltonian structures. We also show that a Hamiltonian evolution equation for closed star-shaped planar curves, discovered by Pinkall, has the Schwarzian KdV equation as its projectivization. (For both flows, the curvature evolves by the KdV equation.) Using algebro-geometric methods and the relation of group-based moving frames to AKNS-type representations, we construct examples of closed solutions of Pinkall's flow associated with periodic finite-gap KdV potentials. 
0808.03594	Elastic $Kπ$ amplitude: a simple model	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:P.C.Magalhães, M.R. Robilotta	Abstract:  We present a chiral model for the $J=0, I=1/2,$ elastic $K\p$ amplitude, suited to be employed in $D^+ \rar K^- \p^+ \p^+$ data analyses and valid between threshold and $1.5 $GeV. Although not as precise as other versions available in the literature, it is rather simple and incorporates the essential physics in this energy domain. In the case of the $K$-matrix approximation, the model allows the pole structure of the $K\p$ amplitude to be understood by solving a quadratic equation in $s$. We show that the solutions to this equation can be well approximated by polynomials of masses and coupling constants. This analytic structure allows a clear understanding why, depending on the values of one of the coupling constants, one may have one or two physical poles. The model yields a pole, associated with the $\k$, at $\sqrt{s}= (0.75 - i 0.24) $GeV. 
0808.03595	Ultrafast dynamics of surface electromagnetic waves in nanohole array on metallic film	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:A. S. Kirakosyan, M. Tong, T. V. Shahbazyan, Z. V. Vardeny	Abstract:  We study the ultrafast dynamics of surface electromagnetic waves photogenerated on aluminum film perforated with subwavelength holes array by means of transient photomodulation with 100 fs time resolution. We observed a pronounced blueshift of the resonant transmission band that reveals the important role of plasma attenuation in the dynamics and that is inconsistent with plasmon-polariton mechanism of extraordinary transmission. The transient photomodulation spectra were successfully modeled within the Boltzmann equation approach for the electron-phonon relaxation dynamics, involving non-equilibrium hot electrons and quasi-equilibrium phonons. 
0808.03596	Magnetothermodynamics of the Ising Antiferromagnet Dy2Ge2O7	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:X. Ke, M. L. Dahlberg, E. Morosan, J.A. Fleitman, R. J. Cava, P. Schiffer	Abstract:  We report systematic low temperature measurements of the DC magnetization, AC susceptibility, and heat capacity of dysprosium pyrogermanate (Dy2Ge2O7) single crystal and powder samples. Our results confirm that Dy2Ge2O7 is an anisotropic antiferromagnet. The isothermal field dependent magnetization and the integrated magnetic entropy both indicate that the Dy3+ ions behave as Ising-like spins, analogous to those in the pyrochlore spin ice materials. Both single-spin and collective spin relaxation phenomena appear to lead to spin freezing in this material, again in analogy to observations in the spin ice materials, suggesting that such phenomena may be generic to a broader class of magnetic materials. 
0808.03597	Generalized Circulant Densities and a Sufficient Condition for Separability	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Dariusz Chruscinski, Arthur O. Pittenger	Abstract:  In a series of papers with Kossakowski, the first author has examined properties of densities for which the positive partial transpositrionm (PPT) property can be readily checked. These densities were also investigated from a different perspective by Baumgartner, Hiesmayr and Narnhofer. In this paper we show how the support of such densities can be expressed in terms of lines in a finite geometry and how that same structure lends itself to checking the necessary PPT condition and to a novel sufficient condition for separability. 
0808.03598	A simple 5D SO(10) GUT and sparticle masses	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Takeshi Fukuyama, Nobuchika Okada	Abstract:  Simple supersymmetric SO(10) GUT in five dimensions is proposed, in which the fifth dimension is compactified on the $S^1/(Z_2\times Z_2^\prime)$ orbifold with two inequivalent branes at the orbifold fixed points. In this model, all matter and Higgs multiplets reside on one brane (PS brane) where the Pati-Salam (PS) symmetry is manifest, while only the SO(10) gauge multiplet resides on the bulk. The supersymmetry breaking on the other brane (SO(10) brane) is transmitted to the PS brane through the gaugino mediation with the bulk gauge multiplet. We examine sparticle mass spectrum in this setup and show that the neutralino LSP as the dark matter candidate can be realized when the compactification scale of the fifth dimension is higher than the PS symmetry breaking scale, keeping the successful gauge coupling unification after incorporating threshold corrections of Kaluza-Klein modes of the bulk gauge multiplets. 
0808.03599	Exceptional Times for the Dynamical Discrete Web	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:L. R. G. Fontes, C. M. Newman, K. Ravishankar, E. Schertzer	Abstract:  The dynamical discrete web (DyDW),introduced in recent work of Howitt and Warren, is a system of coalescing simple symmetric one-dimensional random walks which evolve in an extra continuous dynamical time parameter τ. The evolution is by independent updating of the underlying Bernoulli variables indexed by discrete space-time that define the discrete web at any fixed τ. In this paper, we study the existence of exceptional (random) values of τ where the paths of the web do not behave like usual random walks and the Hausdorff dimension of the set of exceptional such τ. Our results are motivated by those about exceptional times for dynamical percolation in high dimension by Häggstrom, Peres and Steif, and in dimension two by Schramm and Steif. The exceptional behavior of the walks in the DyDW is rather different from the situation for the dynamical random walks of Benjamini, Häggstrom, Peres and Steif. For example, we prove that the walk from the origin S^τ_0 violates the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL) on a set of τof Hausdorff dimension one. We also discuss how these and other results extend to the dynamical Brownian web, the natural scaling limit of the DyDW. 
0808.03600	Lightest U-parity Particle (LUP): a hidden sector dark matter candidate	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Hye-Sung Lee	Abstract:  We introduce a new dark matter candidate, the lightest U-parity particle (LUP). We suggest it as a good dark matter candidate especially in the R-parity violating supersymmetric model. 
0808.03601	The Magnitude-Diameter Relation of Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Sidney van den Bergh	Abstract:  We investigate the dependence of the luminosity-diameter relation of galaxies on the environment. This study is based on a comparison between the 80 galaxies in the Shapley-Ames Catalog that are located within a distance of 10 Mpc, and the luminosity-diameter relation for galaxies in great clusters such as Virgo and Coma. A relatively tight linear correlation is observed between the absolute magnitudes and the logarithms of the linear diameters of galaxies located within 10 Mpc. Surprisingly this observed power-law relationship appears to be almost independent of environment and local mass density as defined by Karachentsev & Malakov. However, at a given luminosity, early-type galaxies are (on average) slightly more compact than are objects of a later type. Unexpectedly the present results appear to indicate that the luminosity-diameter relation for the galaxies within 10 Mpc is indistinguishable from what is observed in the much denser Virgo cluster. Galaxies appear to form an almost one-dimensional family in parameter space. It remains a mystery why the luminosity-diameter relation for galaxies is so insensitive to environment. 
0808.03602	The Highly Eccentric Pre-Main Sequence Spectroscopic Binary RX J0529.3+1210	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:G.N. Mace, L. Prato, L.H. Wasserman, G.H. Schaefer, O.G. Franz, M. Simon	Abstract:  The young system RX J0529.3+1210 was initially identified as a single-lined spectroscopic binary. Using high-resolution infrared spectra, acquired with NIRSPEC on Keck II, we measured radial velocities for the secondary. The method of using the infrared regime to convert single-lined spectra into double-lined spectra, and derive the mass ratio for the binary system, has been successfully used for a number of young, low-mass binaries. For RX J0529.3+1210, a long- period(462 days) and highly eccentric(0.88) binary system, we determine the mass ratio to be 0.78+/-0.05 using the infrared double-lined velocity data alone, and 0.73+/-0.23 combining visible light and infrared data in a full orbital solution. The large uncertainty in the latter is the result of the sparse sampling in the infrared and the high eccentricity: the stars do not have a large velocity separation during most of their ~1.3 year orbit. A mass ratio close to unity, consistent with the high end of the one sigma uncertainty for this mass ratio value, is inconsistent with the lack of a visible light detection of the secondary component. We outline several scenarios for a color difference in the two stars, such as one heavily spotted component, higher order multiplicity, or a unique evolutionary stage, favoring detection of only the primary star in visible light, even in a mass ratio ~1 system. However, the evidence points to a lower ratio. Although RX J0529.3+1210 exhibits no excess at near-infrared wavelengths, a small 24 micron excess is detected, consistent with circumbinary dust. The properties of this binary and its membership in Lambda Ori versus a new nearby stellar moving group at ~90 pc are discussed. We speculate on the origin of this unusual system and on the impact of such high eccentricity on the potential for planet formation. 
0808.03603	Heralded single-magnon quantum memory for photon polarization states	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Haruka Tanji, Saikat Ghosh, Jonathan Simon, Benjamin Bloom, Vladan Vuletić	Abstract:  We demonstrate a heralded quantum memory based on mapping of a photon polarization state onto a single collective-spin excitation (magnon) shared between two spatially overlapped atomic ensembles. The polarization fidelity is measured by quantum state tomography to be above 90(2)% for any input polarization, which far exceeds the classical limit of 2/3. The process also constitutes a quantum non-destructive probe that detects and regenerates a photon without touching its - potentially undetermined - polarization. 
0808.03604	On the dimension of the Hilbert scheme of curves	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Dawei Chen	Abstract:  Consider a component of the Hilbert scheme whose general point corresponds to a degree d genus g smooth irreducible and nondegenerate curve in a projective variety X. We give lower bounds for the dimension of such a component when X is P^3, P^4 or a smooth quadric threefold in P^4 respectively. Those bounds make sense from the asymptotic viewpoint if we fix d and let g vary. Some examples are constructed using determinantal varieties to show the sharpness of the bounds for d and g in a certain range. The results can also be applied to study rigid curves. 
0808.03605	Evidence of structural strain in epitaxial graphene layers on 6H-SiC(0001)	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Nicola Ferralis, Roya Maboudian, Carlo Carraro	Abstract:  The early stages of epitaxial graphene layer growth on the Si-terminated 6H-SiC(0001) are investigated by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and depolarized Raman spectroscopy. The selection of the depolarized component of the scattered light results in a significant increase in the C-C bond signal over the second order SiC Raman signal, which allows to resolve submonolayer growth, including individual, localized C=C dimers in a diamond-like carbon matrix for AES C/Si ratio of $\sim$3, and a strained graphene layer with delocalized electrons and Dirac single-band dispersion for AES C/Si ratio $>$6. The linear strain, measured at room temperature, is found to be compressive, which can be attributed to the large difference between the coefficients of thermal expansion of graphene and SiC. The magnitude of the compressive strain can be varied by adjusting the growth time at fixed annealing temperature. 
0808.03606	Subsurface Meridional Circulation in the Active Belts	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:I. Gonzalez Hernandez, S. Kholikov, F. Hill, R. Howe, R. Komm	Abstract:  Temporal variations of the subsurface meridional flow with the solar cycle have been reported by several authors. The measurements are typically averaged over periods of time during which surface magnetic activity existed in the regions were the velocities are calculated. The present work examines the possible contamination of these measurements due to the extra velocity fields associated with active regions plus the uncertainties in the data obtained where strong magnetic fields are present. We perform a systematic analysis of more than five years of GONG data and compare meridional flows obtained by ring-diagram analysis before and after removing the areas of strong magnetic field. The overall trend of increased amplitude of the meridional flow towards solar minimum remains after removal of large areas associated with surface activity. We also find residual circulation toward the active belts that persist even after the removal of the surface magnetic activity, suggesting the existence of a global pattern or longitudinally-located organized flows. 
0808.03607	Compatibility of DAMA/LIBRA dark matter detection with other searches	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Christopher Savage, Graciela Gelmini, Paolo Gondolo, Katherine Freese	Abstract:  The DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation data, which may be interpreted as a signal for the existence of weakly interacting dark matter (WIMPs) in our galactic halo, are examined in light of null results from other experiments. We use the energy spectrum of the combined DAMA modulation data given in 36 bins, and include the effect of channeling. Several statistical tools are implemented in our study: likelihood ratio with a global fit and with raster scans in the WIMP mass and goodness-of-fit (g.o.f.). These approaches allow us to differentiate between the preferred (global best fit) and allowed (g.o.f.) parameter regions. It is hard to find WIMP masses and couplings consistent with all existing data sets. For spin-independent (SI) interactions, the best fit DAMA regions are ruled out to the 3$σ$ C.L., even with channeling taken into account. However, for WIMP masses of ~8 GeV some parameters outside these regions still yield a moderately reasonable fit to the DAMA data and are compatible with all 90% C.L. upper limits from negative searches, when channeling is included. For spin-dependent (SD) interactions with proton-only couplings, a range of masses below 10 GeV is compatible with DAMA and other experiments, with and without channeling, when SuperK indirect detection constraints are included; without the SuperK constraints, masses as high as ~20 GeV are compatible. For SD neutron-only couplings we find no parameters compatible with all the experiments. Mixed SD couplings are examined: e.g. ~8 GeV mass WIMPs with a_n = +/- a_p are found to be consistent with all experiments. In short, there are surviving regions at low mass for both SI and SD interactions; if indirect detection limits are relaxed, some SD proton-only couplings at high masses also survive. 
0808.03608	Gaslike model of social motility	Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO)	Authors:A. Parravano, L. M. Reyes	Abstract:  We propose a model to represent the motility of social elements. The model is completely deterministic, possesses a small number of parameters, and exhibits a series of properties that are reminiscent of the behavior of comunities in social-ecological competition; these are: (i) similar individuals attract each other; (ii) individuals can form stable groups; (iii) a group of similar individuals breaks into subgroups if it reaches a critical size; (iv) interaction between groups can modify the distribution of the elements as a result of fusion, fission, or pursuit; (v) individuals can change their internal state by interaction with their neighbors. The simplicity of the model and its richness of emergent behaviors, such as, for example, pursuit between groups, make it a useful toy model to explore a diversity of situations by changing the rule by which the internal state of individuals is modified by the interactions with the environment. 
0808.03609	Revisiting an equivalence between maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods in phylogenetics	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:Mareike Fischer, Bhalchandra D. Thatte	Abstract:  Tuffley and Steel (1997) proved that Maximum Likelihood and Maximum Parsimony methods in phylogenetics are equivalent for sequences of characters under a simple symmetric model of substitution with no common mechanism. This result has been widely cited ever since. We show that small changes to the model assumptions suffice to make the two methods inequivalent. In particular, we analyze the case of bounded substitution probabilities as well as the molecular clock assumption. We show that in these cases, even under no common mechanism, Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood might make conflicting choices. We also show that if there is an upper bound on the substitution probabilities which is `sufficiently small', every Maximum Likelihood tree is also a Maximum Parsimony tree (but not vice versa). 
0808.03610	On Universal Cycles of Labeled Graphs	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Greg Brockman, Bill Kay, Emma E. Snively	Abstract:  A universal cycle is a compact listing of a class of combinatorial objects. In this paper, we prove the existence of universal cycles of classes of labeled graphs, including simple graphs, trees, graphs with m edges, graphs with loops, graphs with multiple edges (with up to m duplications of each edge), directed graphs, hypergraphs, and k-uniform hypergraphs. 
0808.03611	Relics of structure formation: extra-planar gas and high-velocity clouds around the Andromeda Galaxy	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Tobias Westmeier, Christian Brüns, Jürgen Kerp	Abstract:  Using the 100-m radio telescope at Effelsberg, we mapped a large area around the Andromeda Galaxy in the 21-cm line emission of neutral hydrogen to search for high-velocity clouds (HVCs) out to large projected distances in excess of 100 kpc. Our 3-sigma HI mass sensitivity for the warm neutral medium is 8x10^4 solar masses. We can confirm the existence of a population of HVCs with typical HI masses of a few times 10^5 solar masses near the disc of M31. However, we did not detect any HVCs beyond a projected distance of about 50 kpc from M31, suggesting that HVCs are generally found in proximity of large spiral galaxies at typical distances of a few 10 kpc. Comparison with CDM-based models and simulations suggests that only a few of the detected HVCs could be associated with primordial dark-matter satellites, whereas others are most likely the result of tidal stripping. The lack of clouds beyond a projected distance of 50 kpc from M31 is also in conflict with the predictions of recent CDM structure formation simulations. A possible solution to this problem could be ionisation of the HVCs as a result of decreasing pressure of the ambient coronal gas at larger distances from M31. A consequence of this scenario would be the presence of hundreds of mainly ionised or pure dark-matter satellites around large spiral galaxies like the Milky Way and M31. 
0808.03612	Difficulties of Preserving the Leap Second	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. Segan, B. Surlan, S. Vidojevic	Abstract:  We examine the possibility to extend leap second extrapolation for a near future based on some periodic terms in the Earth's rotation changes. The IERS data, covering the interval from 1962.15 to 2006.95, are analyzed. The difference $ΔT$ is extrapolated till to 2035 and compared with the IERS extrapolated values to the 2012. It can be seen that for the interval from 2006 to 2024 only 1 leap seconds (negative) will be operated.

0808.03614	Circular Digraph Walks, k-Balanced Strings, Lattice Paths and Chebychev Polynomials	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Evangelos Georgiadis, David Callan, Qing-Hu Hou	Abstract:  We count the number of walks of length n on a k-node circular digraph that cover all k nodes in two ways. The first way illustrates the transfer-matrix method. The second involves counting various classes of height-restricted lattice paths. We observe that the results also count so-called k-balanced strings of length n, generalizing a 1996 Putnam problem. 
0808.03615	The action of Hecke operators on hypergeometric functions	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Victor H. Moll, Sinai Robins, K. Soodhalter	Abstract:  We study the action of Hecke operators on the set of hypergeometric functions. We show that the spectrum of these operators is the set of powers n^a and that polylogarithms play a dominant role in the study of the corresponding eigenfunctions. As a corollary, we obtain a characterization of completely multiplicative hypergeometric coefficients. 
0808.03616	Constructing word similarities in Meroitic as an aid to decipherment	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	Authors:Reginald D. Smith	Abstract:  Meroitic is the still undeciphered language of the ancient civilization of Kush. Over the years, various techniques for decipherment such as finding a bilingual text or cognates from modern or other ancient languages in the Sudan and surrounding areas has not been successful. Using techniques borrowed from information theory and natural language statistics, similar words are paired and attempts are made to use currently defined words to extract at least partial meaning from unknown words. 
0808.03617	The Modification of the Oppenheimer and Snyder Collapsing Dust Ball to a Static Ball in Discrete Space-time	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:G. Chen	Abstract:  Besides the singularity problem, the famous Oppenheimer and Snyder solution is discovered to be of deficiency in two aspects: the internal Friedmann space-time does not have the inherent symmetry and cannot connect to the external Schwarzschild space-time. So the process of gravitational collapse described by this solution is doubtful. The deficiency, together with the singularity problem, result from the imperfection of the field theory in continuous space-time, which is expressed by the infinite precision function theory. The space-time structure of the Oppenheimer and Snyder dust ball is founded to be discrete rather than continuous, and to describe the field theory in discrete space-time it requires a function theory with finite precision. Based on the i order real number and its equivalence class, which is defined in the real number field, the infinite precision function theory is extended to the finite precision function theory. The Einstein field equations are expressed in the form of finite precision, and then the collapsing dust ball solution in continuous space-time is modified to a static ball solution in discrete space-time. It solves all the problems of Oppenheimer and Snyder solution and shows that, with Planck length and Planck time as space-time quantum, a mechanism to resist the gravitational collapse could be obtained by the discretization of space-time. 
0808.03618	A standard Hamiltonian formulation for the dynamical Casimir effect	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Toru Kawakubo, Katsuji Yamamoto	Abstract:  We present a quantum description of photon creation via dynamical Casimir effect based on the standard Hamiltonian formulation. The particle representation is constructed in the expansion of field operators fixed with the initial modes. The Hamiltonian is presented in terms of the creation and annihilation operators with the time-varying couplings which originate from the external properties such as an oscillating boundary or a plasma mirror of a semiconductor slab. Some consideration is also made for the experimental realization with a semiconductor plasma mirror. 
0808.03619	Study of Bc --> J/psi pi, etac pi decays with perturbative QCD approach	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Jun-Feng Sun, Dong-Sheng Du, Yue-Ling Yang	Abstract:  The Bc --> J/psi pi, etac pi decays are studied with the perturbative QCD approach. It is found that form factors and branching ratios are sensitive to the parameters w, v, f_J/psi and f_etac, where w and v are the parameters of the charmonium wave functions for Coulomb potential and harmonic oscillator potential, respectively, f_J/psi and f_etac are the decay constants of the J/psi and etac mesons, respectively. The large branching ratios and the clear signals of the final states make the Bc --> J/psi pi, etac pi decays to be the prospective channels for measurements at the hadron colliders 
0808.03620	Observation of Cold Collisions between Trapped Ions and Trapped Atoms	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:Andrew T. Grier, Marko Cetina, Fedja Oručević, Vladan Vuletić	Abstract:  We demonstrate a double-trap system well suited to study cold collisions between trapped ions and trapped atoms. Using Yb$^+$ ions confined in a Paul trap and Yb atoms in a magneto-optical trap, we investigate charge-exchange collisions of several isotopes for collision energies down to 400 neV (5 mK). The measured rate coefficient of $6 \times 10^{-10}$ cm$^{3}$s$^{-1}$, constant over four orders of magnitude in collision energy, is in good agreement with that derived from a semiclassical Langevin model for an atomic polarizability of 143 a.u. 
0808.03621	Heterotic and M-theory Compactifications for String Phenomenology	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Lara B. Anderson	Abstract:  In this thesis, we explore two approaches to string phenomenology. In the first half of the work, we investigate M-theory compactifications on spaces with co-dimension four, orbifold singularities. We construct M-theory on C^2/Z_N by coupling 11-dimensional supergravity to a seven-dimensional Yang-Mills theory located on the orbifold fixed-plane. The resulting action is supersymmetric to leading non-trivial order in the 11-dim Newton constant. We thereby reduce M-theory on a G2 orbifold with C^2/Z_N singularities, explicitly incorporating the additional gauge fields at the singularities. We derive the Kahler potential, gauge-kinetic function and superpotential for the resulting N=1 four-dimensional theory. Blowing-up of the orbifold is described by a Higgs effect and the results are consistent with the corresponding ones obtained for smooth G2 spaces. Further, we consider flux and Wilson lines on singular loci of the G2 space, and discuss the relation to N=4 SYM theory. In the second half, we develop an algorithmic framework for E8 x E8 heterotic compactifications with monad bundles. We begin by considering cyclic Calabi-Yau manifolds where we classify positive monad bundles, prove stability, and compute the complete particle spectrum for all bundles. Next, we generalize the construction to bundles on complete intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds. We show that the class of positive monad bundles, subject to the heterotic anomaly condition, is finite (~7000 models). We compute the particle spectrum for these models and develop new techniques for computing the cohomology of line bundles. There are no anti-generations of particles and the spectrum is manifestly moduli-dependent. We further study the slope-stability of positive monad bundles and develop a new method for proving stability of SU(n) vector bundles. 
0808.03622	Vital rates from the action of mutation accumulation	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:Kenneth W. Wachter, David R. Steinsaltz, Steven N. Evans	Abstract:  New models for evolutionary processes of mutation accumulation allow hypotheses about the age-specificity of mutational effects to be translated into predictions of heterogeneous population hazard functions. We apply these models to questions in the biodemography of longevity, including proposed explanations of Gompertz hazards and mortality plateaus, and use them to explore the possibility of melding evolutionary and functional models of aging. 
0808.03623	Calculation of material properties for arbitrary shape transformation media	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Jin Hu, Xiaoming Zhou, Gengkai Hu	Abstract:  We propose a general method to evaluate the material parameters for arbitrary shape transformation media. By solving the original coordinates in the transformed region via Laplace's equations, we can obtain the deformation field numerically, in turn the material properties of the devices to be designed such as cloaks, rotators or concentrators with arbitrary shape. Devices which have non-fixed outer boundaries, such as beam guider, can also be designed by the proposed method. Examples with full wave simulation are given for illustration. In the end, wave velocity and energy change in the transformation media are discussed with help of the deformation view. 
0808.03624	A Dual Non-abelian Yang-Mills Amplitude in Four Dimensions	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:J. Wade Cherrington, J. Daniel Christensen	Abstract:  We derive an explicit formula for the vertex amplitude of dual SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions on the lattice, and provide an efficient algorithm (of order j to the fourth power) for its computation. This opens the way for both numerical and analytic development of dual methods, previously limited to the case of three dimensions. 
0808.03625	Torque and conventional spin-Hall currents in two-dimensional spin-orbit coupled systems: Universal relation and hyper-selection rule	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Tsung-Wei Chen, Guang-Yu Guo	Abstract:  We investigate torque and also conventionally defined spin-Hall currents in two-dimensional (2D) spin-orbit coupled systems of spin-1/2 particles within the linear response Kubo formalism. We obtain some interesting relations between the conventional and torque spin-Hall conductivities for the generic effective Hamiltonian $H_0=ε_k^0+A(k)σ_x-B(k)σ_y$, where $A(k)=η^A_ik_i+η^A_{ij}k_ik_j+η^A_{ijl}k_ik_jk_l+...$, $B(k)=η^B_ik_i+η^B_{ij}k_ik_j+η^B_{ijl}k_ik_jk_l+...$, and $η$'s are the specific system-dependent coefficients. Specifically, we find that in the intrinsic case the magnitude of torque spin-Hall conductivity $σ^{τ_z}_{xy}(0)$ is always twice larger than the conventional spin-Hall conductivity $σ^{s_z}_{xy}(0)$, and the two conductivities have the opposite signs, i.e., $σ^{τ_z}_{xy}(0)=-2σ^{s_z}_{xy}(0)$. This universal relation also holds in the presence of an uniform in-plane magnetic field. We also find that if the energy dispersion is rotationally invariant, there exists a hyper-angular momentum $I_z = (k\times \partialθ/\partial k)_z s_z + L_z$ which is conserved. Furthermore, the hyper-angular momentum current $<{1/2}\{I_z,v_x\}>$ vanishes, and this leads to a hyper selection rule for the conventional spin-Hall current. 
0808.03626	Hard Break-Up of Two-Nucleons and QCD Dynamics of NN Interaction	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:Misak M. Sargsian	Abstract:  We discus recent developments in theory of high energy two-body break-up of few-nucleon systems. The characteristics of these reactions are such that the hard two-body quasielastic subprocess can be clearly separated from the accompanying soft subprocesses. We discuss in details the hard rescattering model(HRM) in which hard photodisintegration develops in two stages. At first, photon knocks-out an energetic quark which rescatters subsequently with a quark of the other nucleon. The latter provides a mechanism of sharing the initial high momentum of the photon between two outgoing nucleons. This final state hard rescattering can be expressed through the hard NN scattering amplitude. Within HRM we discuss hard break-up reactions involving D and 3He targets and demonstrate how these reactions are sensitive to the dynamics of hard pn and pp interaction. Another development of HRM is the prediction of new helicity selection mechanism for hard two-body reactions, which was apparently confirmed in the recent JLab experiment. 
0808.03627	Butterflies I: morphisms of 2-group stacks	Category Theory (math.CT)	Authors:Ettore Aldrovandi, Behrang Noohi	Abstract:  Weak morphisms of non-abelian complexes of length 2, or crossed modules, are morphisms of the associated 2-group stacks, or gr-stacks. We present a full description of the weak morphisms in terms of diagrams we call butterflies. We give a complete description of the resulting bicategory of crossed modules, which we show is fibered and biequivalent to the 2-stack of 2-group stacks. As a consequence we obtain a complete characterization of the non-abelian derived category of complexes of length 2. Deligne's analogous theorem in the case of Picard stacks and abelian sheaves becomes an immediate corollary. Commutativity laws on 2-group stacks are also analyzed in terms of butterflies, yielding new characterizations of braided, symmetric, and Picard 2-group stacks. Furthermore, the description of a weak morphism in terms of the corresponding butterfly diagram allows us to obtain a long exact sequence in non-abelian cohomology, removing a preexisting fibration condition on the coefficients short exact sequence. 
0808.03628	Numerical Models of Travel-Time Inhomogeneities in Sunspots	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:H. Moradi, S. M. Hanasoge, P. S. Cally	Abstract:  We investigate the direct contribution of strong, sunspot-like magnetic fields to helioseismic wave travel-time shifts via two numerical forward models, a 3D ideal MHD solver and MHD ray theory. The simulated data cubes are analyzed using the traditional time-distance center-to-annulus measurement technique. We also isolate and analyze the direct contribution from purely thermal perturbations to the observed travel-time shifts, confirming some existing ideas and bring forth new ones: (i) that the observed travel-time shifts in the vicinity of sunspots are largely governed by MHD physics, (ii) the travel-time shifts are sensitively dependent on frequency and phase-speed filter parameters and the background power below the $p_1$ ridge, and finally, (iii) despite its seeming limitations, ray theory succeeds in capturing the essence of the travel-time variations as derived from the MHD simulations. 
0808.03629	Hyperon Polarization in Unpolarized Scattering Processes	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Jian Zhou, Feng Yuan, Zuo-Tang Liang	Abstract:  Transverse polarization in the Hyperon production in the unpolarized deep inelastic scattering and pp collisions is studied in the twist-three approach, considering the contribution from the quark-gluon-antiquark correlation distribution in nucleon. We further compare our results for deep inelastic scattering to a transverse momentum dependent factorization approach, and find consistency between the two approaches in the intermediate transverse momentum region. We also find that in pp collisions, there are only derivative terms contributions, and the non-derivative terms vanish. 
0808.03630	Periodic Oscillations in the Intra-day Optical Light Curves of the Blazar S5 0716+714	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Alok C. Gupta (1), A. K. Srivastava (1), Paul J. Wiita (2,3) ((1) ARIES, Nainital, India, (2) GSU, Atlanta, GA (3) IAS, Princeton, NJ)    	Abstract:  We present results of a periodicity search of 20 intra-day variable optical light curves of the blazar S5 0716+714, selected from a database of 102 light curves spanning over three years. We use a wavelet analysis technique along with a randomization test and find strong candidates for nearly periodic variations in eight light curves, with probabilities ranging from 95% to >99%. This is the first good evidence for periodic, or more-precisely, quasi-periodic, components in the optical intra-day variable light curves of any blazar. Such periodic flux changes support the idea that some active galactic nuclei variability, even in blazars, is based on accretion disk fluctuations or oscillations. These intra-day variability time scales are used to estimate that the central black hole of the blazar S5 0716+714 has a mass > 2.5 \times 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$. As we did not find any correlations between the flux levels and intra-day variability time scales, it appears that more than one emission mechanism is at work in this blazar. 
0808.03631	Large deviations for infinite dimensional stochastic dynamical systems	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Amarjit Budhiraja, Paul Dupuis, Vasileios Maroulas	Abstract:  The large deviations analysis of solutions to stochastic differential equations and related processes is often based on approximation. The construction and justification of the approximations can be onerous, especially in the case where the process state is infinite dimensional. In this paper we show how such approximations can be avoided for a variety of infinite dimensional models driven by some form of Brownian noise. The approach is based on a variational representation for functionals of Brownian motion. Proofs of large deviations properties are reduced to demonstrating basic qualitative properties (existence, uniqueness and tightness) of certain perturbations of the original process. 
0808.03632	On bound states of multiple t-quarks due to Higgs exchange	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Michael Kuchiev, Victor Flambaum, Edward Shuryak	Abstract:  Froggatt, Nielsen et al suggested that the Higgs boson exchange between top quarks produces enough attraction to generate their multiple bound states. Furthermore they claimed that the system of 6 top and 6 anti-top quarks is bound so strongly that the binding energy nearly compensates the masses of t-quarks, making it very light. We calculated the energy of such states more accurately, variationally and by self-consistent mean field approximation, and found that these state are weakly bound for massless Higgs boson and unbound with the account for its mass. 
0808.03633	Majorana bound state in rotating superfluid 3He-A between parallel plates	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Y. Tsutsumi, T. Kawakami, T. Mizushima, M. Ichioka, K. Machida	Abstract:  A concrete and experimentally feasible example for testing the putative Majorana zero energy state bound in a vortex is theoretically proposed for a parallel plate geometry of superfluid $^3$He-A phase. We examine the experimental setup in connection with ongoing rotating cryostat experiments. The theoretical analysis is based on the well-established Ginzburg--Landau functional, supplemented by microscopic calculations of the Bogoliubov--de Gennes equation, both of which allow the precise location of the parameter regions of the Majorana state to be found in realistic situations. 
0808.03634	Floer homology for negative line bundles and Reeb chords in pre-quantization spaces	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Peter Albers, Urs Frauenfelder	Abstract:  In this article we prove existence of Reeb orbits for Bohr-Sommerfeld Legendrians in certain pre-quantization spaces. We give a quantitative estimate from below. These estimates are obtained by studying Floer homology for fibre-wise quadratic Hamiltonian functions on negative line bundles. 
0808.03635	Maximum distributions of bridges of noncolliding Brownian paths	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Naoki Kobayashi, Minami Izumi, Makoto Katori	Abstract:  The one-dimensional Brownian motion starting from the origin at time $t=0$, conditioned to return to the origin at time $t=1$ and to stay positive during time interval $0 < t < 1$, is called the Bessel bridge with duration 1. We consider the $N$-particle system of such Bessel bridges conditioned never to collide with each other in $0 < t < 1$, which is the continuum limit of the vicious walk model in watermelon configuration with a wall. Distributions of maximum-values of paths attained in the time interval $t \in (0,1)$ are studied to characterize the statistics of random patterns of the repulsive paths on the spatio-temporal plane. For the outermost path, the distribution function of maximum value is exactly determined for general $N$. We show that the present $N$-path system of noncolliding Bessel bridges is realized as the positive-eigenvalue process of the $2N \times 2N$ matrix-valued Brownian bridge in the symmetry class C. Using this fact computer simulations are performed and numerical results on the $N$-dependence of the maximum-value distributions of the inner paths are reported. The present work demonstrates that the extreme-value problems of noncolliding paths are related with the random matrix theory, representation theory of symmetry, and the number theory. 
0808.03636	Physics education research: Resources for graduate student instructors	Physics Education (physics.ed-ph)	Authors:Zosia A. C. Krusberg	Abstract:  This resource letter intends to provide physics instructors - particularly graduate student teaching assistants - at the introductory university level with a small but representative collection of resources to acquire a familiarity with research in physics education for guidance in everyday instruction. The resources are in the form of books, articles, websites, journals, and organizations. 
0808.03637	Nucleon structure in terms of OPE with non-perturbative Wilson coefficients	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:W. Bietenholz, N. Cundy, M. Gockeler, R. Horsley, H. Perlt, D. Pleiter, P.E.L. Rakow, G. Schierholz, A. Schiller, J.M. Zanotti	Abstract:  Lattice calculations could boost our understanding of Deep Inelastic Scattering by evaluating moments of the Nucleon Structure Functions. To this end we study the product of electromagnetic currents between quark states. The Operator Product Expansion (OPE) decomposes it into matrix elements of local operators (depending on the quark momenta) and Wilson coefficients (as functions of the larger photon momenta). For consistency with the matrix elements, we evaluate a set of Wilson coefficients non-perturbatively, based on propagators for numerous momentum sources, on a 24^3 x 48 lattice. The use of overlap quarks suppresses unwanted operator mixing and lattice artifacts. Results for the leading Wilson coefficients are extracted by means of Singular Value Decomposition. 
0808.03638	Incoherence induced sign change in noise cross-correlations: A case study in the full counting statistics of a pure spin pump	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Colin Benjamin	Abstract:  The full counting statistics of a non adiabatic pure spin pump are calculated with particular emphasis on the second and third moments. We show that incoherence can change the sign of spin shot noise cross-correlations from negative to positive, implying entanglement for spin-singlet electronic sources, a truly counterintuitive result. The third moment on the other hand is shown to be much more resilient to incoherence. 
0808.03639	Quark-gluon mixed condensate of the QCD vacuum in Holographic QCD	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Hyun-Chul Kim, Youngman Kim	Abstract:  We investigate the quark-gluon mixed condensate based on an AdS/QCD model. Introducing a holographic field dual to the operator for the quark-gluon mixed condensate, we obtain the corresponding classical equation of motion. Taking the mixed condensate as an additional free parameter, we show that the present scheme reproduces very well experimental data. A fixed value of the mixed condensate is in good agreement with that of the QCD sum rules. 
0808.03640	Fixed points and boundary layers in exclusion processes	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Sutapa Mukherji	Abstract:  In this paper, we show how a fixed point based boundary layer analysis can be used to understand phases and phase transitions in asymmetric simple exclusion processes (ASEPs) with open boundaries. In order to illustrate this method, we choose a two-species ASEP which has interesting phase transitions not seen in the one-species case. We also apply this method to the single species problem where the analysis is simple but nevertheless quite insightful. 
0808.03641	Gravitational excitation of high frequency QPOs	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Zdeněk Stuchlík, Sushan Konar, John C. Miller, Stanislav Hledík	Abstract:  We discuss the possibility that high-frequency QPOs in neutron-star binary systems may result from forced resonant oscillations of matter in the innermost parts of the accretion disc, excited by gravitational perturbations coming from asymmetries of the neutron star or from the companion star. We find that neutron-star asymmetries could, in principle, be effective for inducing both radial and vertical oscillations of relevant amplitude while the binary companion might possibly produce significant radial oscillations but not vertical ones. Misaligned neutron-star quadrupole moments of a size advocated elsewhere for explaining limiting neutron star periods could be large enough also for the present purpose. 
0808.03642	Epitaxial Zn(x)Fe(3-x)O(4) Thin Films: A Spintronic Material with Tunable Electrical and Magnetic Properties	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Deepak Venkateshvaran, Matthias Althammer, Andrea Nielsen, Stephan Gepraegs, M.S. Ramachandra Rao, Sebastian T. B. Goennenwein, Matthias Opel, Rudolf Gross	Abstract:  The ferrimagnetic spinel oxide Zn(x)Fe(3-x)O(4) combines high Curie temperature and spin polarization with tunable electrical and magnetic properties, making it a promising functional material for spintronic devices. We have grown epitaxial thin films with 0<=x<=0.9 on MgO(001) substrates with excellent structural properties both in pure Ar atmosphere and an Ar/O2 mixture by laser molecular beam epitaxy. We find that the electrical conductivity and the saturation magnetization can be tuned over a wide range during growth. Our extensive characterization of the films provides a clear picture of the underlying physics of this spinel ferrimagnet with antiparallel Fe moments on the A and B sublattice: (i) Zn substitution removes both Fe3+ moments from the A sublattice and itinerant charge carriers from the B sublattice, (ii) growth in finite oxygen partial pressure generates Fe vacancies on the B sublattice also removing itinerant charge carriers, and (iii) application of both Zn substitution and excess oxygen results in a compensation effect as Zn substitution partially removes the Fe vacancies. A decrease (increase) of charge carrier density results in a weakening (strengthening) of double exchange and thereby a decrease (increase) of conductivity and the saturation magnetization. This scenario is confirmed by the observation that the saturation magnetization scales with the longitudinal conductivity. The combination of tailored films with semiconductor materials such as ZnO in multi-functional heterostructures seems to be particularly appealing. 
0808.03643	Bayesian Methods for Parameter Estimation in Effective Field Theories	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Matthias R. Schindler, Daniel R. Phillips	Abstract:  We demonstrate and explicate Bayesian methods for fitting the parameters that encode the impact of short-distance physics on observables in effective field theories (EFTs). We use Bayes' theorem together with the principle of maximum entropy to account for the prior information that these parameters should be natural, i.e.O(1) in appropriate units. Marginalization can then be employed to integrate the resulting probability density function (pdf) over the EFT parameters that are not of specific interest in the fit. We also explore marginalization over the order of the EFT calculation, M, and over the variable, R, that encodes the inherent ambiguity in the notion that these parameters are O(1). This results in a very general formula for the pdf of the EFT parameters of interest given a data set, D. We use this formula and the simpler "augmented chi-squared" in a toy problem for which we generate pseudo-data. These Bayesian methods, when used in combination with the "naturalness prior", facilitate reliable extractions of EFT parameters in cases where chi-squared methods are ambiguous at best. We also examine the problem of extracting the nucleon mass in the chiral limit, M_0, and the nucleon sigma term, from pseudo-data on the nucleon mass as a function of the pion mass. We find that Bayesian techniques can provide reliable information on M_0, even if some of the data points used for the extraction lie outside the region of applicability of the EFT. 
0808.03644	Two-Fluid Viscous Modified Gravity on a RS Brane	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Iver Brevik	Abstract:  Singularities in the dark energy late universe are discussed, under the assumption that the Lagrangian contains the Einstein term R plus a modified gravity term R^α, where αis a constant. The 4D fluid is taken to be viscous and composed of two components, one Einstein component where the bulk viscosity is proportional to the scalar expansion θ, and another modified component where the bulk viscosity is proportional to the power θ^{2α-1}. Under these conditions it is known from earlier that the bulk viscosity can drive the fluid from the quintessence region (w > -1) into the phantom region (w<-1), where w is the thermodynamical parameter [I. Brevik, Gen. Rel. Grav. 38, 1317 (2006)]. We combine this 4D theory with the 5D Randall-Sundrum II theory in which there is a single spatially flat brane situated at y=0. We find that the Big Rip singularity, which occurs in 4D theory if α>1/2, carries over to the 5D metric in the bulk, |y|>0. The present investigation generalizes that of an earlier paper [I. Brevik, arXiv:0807.1797; to appear in Eur. Phys. J. C] in which only a one-component modified fluid was present. 
0808.03645	Geometric cross sections of rotating strings and black holes	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Toshihiro Matsuo, Kin-ya Oda	Abstract:  We study the production cross section of a highly excited string with fixed angular momentum from an ultra-high energy collision of two light strings. We find that the cross section exhibits geometric behavior in a certain region of angular-momentum/impact-parameter space. This geometric behavior is common to the differential cross sections of a black hole production with fixed angular momentum and thus we see another correspondence between strings and black holes. 
0808.03646	Finite type invariants of words and Arnold's invariants	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:M. Fujiwara	Abstract:  We define a new finite type invariant for stably homeomorphic class of curves on compact oriented surfaces without boundaries and extend to a regular homotopy invariant for spherical curves. 
0808.03647	Extension theorems for differential forms and Bogomolov-Sommese vanishing on log canonical varieties	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Daniel Greb, Stefan Kebekus, Sándor J. Kovács	Abstract:  Given a p-form defined on the smooth locus of a normal variety, and a resolution of singularities, we study the problem of extending the pull-back of the p-form over the exceptional set of the desingularization. For log canonical pairs and for certain values of p, we show that an extension always exists, possibly with logarithmic poles along the exceptional set. As a corollary, it is shown that sheaves of reflexive differentials enjoy good pull-back properties. A natural generalization of the well-known Bogomolov-Sommese vanishing theorem to log canonical threefold pairs follows. 
0808.03648	Enhanced radiative strength in the quasi-continuum of 117Sn	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:U. Agvaanluvsan, A. C. Larsen, R. Chankova, M. Guttormsen, G. E. Mitchell, A. Schiller, S. Siem, A. Voinov	Abstract:  Radiative strength functions of 117Sn has been measured below the neutron separation energy using the (3He,3He'gamma) reactions. An increase in the slope of the strength functions around E_gamma= 4.5 MeV indicates the onset of a resonance-like structure, giving a significant enhancement of the radiative strength function compared to standard models in the energy region 4.5 <= E_gamma <= 8.0 MeV. For the first time, the functional form of this resonance-like structure has been measured in an odd tin nucleus below neutron threshold in the quasi-continuum region.

0808.03650	Study of intermediate two-body decays in $\bar{B}^0\to Σ_c(2455)^{0}\bar{p}π^{+}$	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Belle collaboration: H.O.Kim, et al.    	Abstract:  We present results of a detailed study of the three-body $\bar{B}^0\toΣ_c(2455)^{0}\bar{p}π^{+}$ decay. A significant enhancement of signal events is observed in the $\bar{p}π^+$ mass system near $1.5 {\rm GeV}/c^2$ that is consistent with the presence of an intermediate baryonic resonance $\bar{N}^0$, where $\bar{N}^0$ is the $\bar{N}(1440)^0 P_{11}$ or $\bar{N}(1535)^0 S_{11}$ state, or an admixture of the two states. We measure the product ${\cal B}(\bar{B}^0\toΣ_c(2455)^{0}\bar{N}^0)\times{\cal B}(\bar{N}^0\to\bar{p}π^+)$= ($0.80\pm0.15\rm{(stat.)}\pm0.14\rm{(syst.)}\pm0.21$)$\times10^{-4}$, where the last error is due to the uncertainty in ${\cal B}(Λ_c^+\to p K^-π^+)$. The significance of the signal is 6.1 standard deviations. This analysis is based on a data sample of 357 fb$^{-1}$, accumulated at the $Υ(4S)$ resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider. 
0808.03651	Flow Faster: Efficient Decision Algorithms for Probabilistic Simulations	Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)	Authors:Lijun Zhang, Holger Hermanns, Friedrich Eisenbrand, David N. Jansen	Abstract:  Strong and weak simulation relations have been proposed for Markov chains, while strong simulation and strong probabilistic simulation relations have been proposed for probabilistic automata. However, decision algorithms for strong and weak simulation over Markov chains, and for strong simulation over probabilistic automata are not efficient, which makes it as yet unclear whether they can be used as effectively as their non-probabilistic counterparts. This paper presents drastically improved algorithms to decide whether some (discrete- or continuous-time) Markov chain strongly or weakly simulates another, or whether a probabilistic automaton strongly simulates another. The key innovation is the use of parametric maximum flow techniques to amortize computations. We also present a novel algorithm for deciding strong probabilistic simulation preorders on probabilistic automata, which has polynomial complexity via a reduction to an LP problem. When extending the algorithms for probabilistic automata to their continuous-time counterpart, we retain the same complexity for both strong and strong probabilistic simulations. 
0808.03652	Some Applications of the Isoperimetric Inequality for Integral Varifolds	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Ulrich Menne	Abstract:  In this work the Isoperimetric Inequality for integral varifolds is used to obtain sharp estimates for the size of the set where the density quotient is small and to generalise Calderón's and Zygmund's theory of first order differentiability for functions in Lebesgue spaces from Lebesgue measure to integral varifolds. 
0808.03653	Associative algebra deformations of the Connes-Moscovici's Hopf algebra $\mathcal{H}_1$	Quantum Algebra (math.QA)	Authors:Alice Fialowski (Eotvos Lorand University Budapest, Hungary), Friedrich Wagemann (Universite Nantes, France)    	Abstract:  We compute the second Hochschild cohomology space $HH^2(\mathcal{H}_1)$ of Connes-Moscovici's Hopf algebra $\mathcal{H}_1$, giving the infinitesimal deformations (up to equivalence) of the associative structure. $HH^2(\mathcal{H}_1)$ is shown to be one dimensional, and thus Connes-Moscovici's formal deformation of $\mathcal{H}_1$ using Rankin-Cohen brackets is unique up to equivalence. 
0808.03654	Gauge symmetries of systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Farhang Loran	Abstract:  For systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom, it is shown in [arXiv:hep-th/0303014] that first class constraints are Abelianizable if the Faddeev-Popov determinant is not vanishing for some choice of subsidiary constraints. Here, for irreducible first class constraint systems with SO(3) or SO(4) gauge symmetries, including a subset of coordinates in the fundamental representation of the gauge group, we explicitly determine the Abelianizable and non-Abelianizable classes of constraints. For the Abelianizable class, we explicitly solve the constraints to obtain the equivalent set of Abelian first class constraints. We show that for non-Abelianizable constraints there exist residual gauge symmetries which results in confinement-like phenomena. 
0808.03655	Entanglement in doped Resonating Valence Bond states	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Ravishankar Ramanathan, Dagomir Kaszlikowski, Marcin Wiesniak, Vlatko Vedral	Abstract:  We investigate the entanglement properties of resonating valence bond states on a two dimensional lattice in the presence of dopants that remove electrons from the lattice creating "holes". The movement of the holes generated by the Hubbard Hamiltonian in the regime of strong Coloumb repulsion in this setting could be responsible for the phenomenon of high temperature superconductivity as hypothesised by Anderson in Science {\bf 235}, 1196, (1987). We argue that there is a particular density of dopants (holes) where the entanglement contained in the lattice attains its maximal value for the nearest-neighbour RVB liquid state. 
0808.03656	Martingale approach to stochastic differential games of control and stopping	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Ioannis Karatzas, Ingrid-Mona Zamfirescu	Abstract:  We develop a martingale approach for studying continuous-time stochastic differential games of control and stopping, in a non-Markovian framework and with the control affecting only the drift term of the state-process. Under appropriate conditions, we show that the game has a value and construct a saddle pair of optimal control and stopping strategies. Crucial in this construction is a characterization of saddle pairs in terms of pathwise and martingale properties of suitable quantities. 
0808.03657	Performance characteristics of positive and negative delayed feedback on chaotic dynamics of directly modulated InGaAsP semiconductor lasers	Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)	Authors:Bindu M. Krishna, Manu. P. John, V. M. Nandakumaran	Abstract:  The chaotic dynamics of directly modulated semiconductor lasers with delayed optoelectronic feedback is studied numerically. The effects of positive and negative delayed optoelectronic feedback in producing chaotic outputs from such lasers with nonlinear gain reduction in its optimum value range is investigated using bifurcation diagrams. The results are confirmed by calculating the Lyapunov exponents. A negative delayed optoelectronic feedback configuration is found to be more effective in inducing chaotic dynamics to such systems with nonlinear gain reduction factor in the practical value range. 
0808.03658	Bi-stability in voltage-biased NISIN structures	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:I. Snyman, Yu. V. Nazarov	Abstract:  As a generic example of a voltage-driven superconducting structure we study a short superconductor connected to normal leads by means of low transparency tunnel junctions, with a voltage bias $V$ between the leads. The superconducting order parameter $Δ$ is to be determined self-consistently. We study the stationary states of the system as well as the dynamics after a perturbation. We find a region in parameter space where there are two stable stationary states at a given voltage. These bi-stable states are distinguished by distinct values of the superconducting order parameter $Δ$ and of the current between the leads. We have evaluated (1) the multi-valued superconducting order parameter $Δ$ at given $V$; (2) the current between the leads at a given V; and (3) the critical voltage at which superconductivity in the island ceases. With regards to dynamics, we find numerical evidence that the stationary states are stable and that no complicated non-stationary regime can be induced by changing the voltage. This result is somewhat unexpected and by no means trivial, given the fact that the system is driven out of equilibrium. The response to a change in the voltage is always gradual, even in the regime where changing the interaction strength induces rapid anharmonic oscillations of the order parameter. 
0808.03659	Bloch-like Electronic Wave Functions in Two-Dimensional Quasicrystals	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Shahar Even-Dar Mandel, Ron Lifshitz	Abstract:  Electrons in quasicrystals generically possess critical wave functions that are neither exponentially-localized nor extended, but rather decay algebraically in space. Nevertheless, motivated by recent calculations on the square and cubic Fibonacci quasicrystals, we investigate whether it is possible to obtain extended wave functions expressed as linear combinations of degenerate, or nearly-degenerate, critical eigenfunctions. We find that not only is this possible, but that the wave functions that emerge are Bloch-like, exhibiting the quasiperiodic long-range order of the underlying quasicrystal. We discuss the significance of this result for the study of electronic properties of real quasicrystals. 
0808.03660	A Sobolev Poincaré type inequality for integral varifolds	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Ulrich Menne	Abstract:  In this work a local inequality is provided which bounds the distance of an integral varifold from a multivalued plane (height) by its tilt and mean curvature. The bounds obtained for the exponents of the Lebesgue spaces involved are shown to be sharp. 
0808.03661	Degree-distribution Stability of Growing Networks	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Zhenting Hou, Xiangxing Kong, Dinghua Shi, Guanrong Chen, Qinggui Zhao	Abstract:  In this paper, we abstract a kind of stochastic processes from evolving processes of growing networks, this process is called growing network Markov chains. Thus the existence and the formulas of degree distribution are transformed to the corresponding problems of growing network Markov chains. First we investigate the growing network Markov chains, and obtain the condition in which the steady degree distribution exists and get its exact formulas. Then we apply it to various growing networks. With this method, we get a rigorous, exact and unified solution of the steady degree distribution for growing networks. 
0808.03662	Approaching the Dirac point in high mobility multi-layer epitaxial graphene	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Milan Orlita, Clement Faugeras, Paulina Plochocka, Petr Neugebauer, Gerard Martinez, Duncan K. Maude, Anne-Laure Barra, Mike Sprinkle, Claire Berger, Walter A. de Heer, Marek Potemski	Abstract:  Multi-layer epitaxial graphene (MEG) is investigated using far infrared (FIR) transmission experiments in the different limits of low magnetic fields and high temperatures. The cyclotron-resonance like absorption is observed at low temperature in magnetic fields below 50 mT, allowing thus to probe the nearest vicinity of the Dirac point and to estimate the conductivity in nearly undoped graphene. The carrier mobility is found to exceed 250,000 cm$^2$/(V.s). In the limit of high temperatures, the well-defined Landau level (LL) quantization is observed up to room temperature at magnetic fields below 1 T, a phenomenon unique in solid state systems. A negligible increase in the width of the cyclotron resonance lines with increasing temperature indicates that no important scattering mechanism is thermally activated, supporting recent expectations of high room-temperature mobilities in graphene. 
0808.03663	Recent HERA Results on Leptoquarks and other SUSY-related Signatures	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Stefan Schmitt	Abstract:  The HERA ep collider and the experiments H1 and ZEUS operated from 1994-2007. A total integrated luminosity of almost 1 fb^-1 was collected at centre-of-mass energies up to 320 GeV. Results from searches for leptoquarks and squarks, final states with an isolated lepton and missing transverse momentum and final states with multi-leptons are presented. The leptoquark limits are interpreted in terms of limits on squark production in SUSY models with R-parity violating couplings. 
0808.03664	Tiny Graviton Matrix Theory On Time-Dependent Background	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Bin Chen, Xiao Liu	Abstract:  In this article we construct a tiny graviton matrix model for type IIB string theory on a plane-wave background with null dilaton. For the linear null dilaton case, we analyze its vacuum and the excitation spectrum around the vacuum, and discuss the time-dependent fuzzy three-sphere solutions and their evolution. It turns out that at very late time the non-Abelian fuzzy degrees of freedom disappear, which indicates the appearance of perturbative strings. 
0808.03665	Second order rectifiability of integral varifolds of locally bounded first variation	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Ulrich Menne	Abstract:  In this work it is shown that every integral varifold in an open subset of Euclidian space of locally bounded first variation can be covered by a countable collection of submanifolds of class C^2. Moreover, the mean curvature of each member of the collection agrees with the mean curvature of the varifold almost everywhere with respect to the varifold. 
0808.03666	Structural and critical current properties in polycrystalline SmO1-xFxFeAs	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Lei Wang, Zhaoshun Gao, Yanpeng Qi, Xianping Zhang, Dongliang Wang, Yanwei Ma	Abstract:  A series of polycrystalline SmO1-xFxFeAs bulks (x=0.15, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4) were prepared by the conventional solid state reaction. Resistivity, susceptibility, magnetic hysteresis, critical current density and microstructure of these samples have been investigated. It is found that critical transition temperature Tc increases steadily with increasing fluorine content, with the highest onset Tc=53 K at x=0.4. On the other hand, the superconductivity seems correlated with lattice constants; that is, Tc rises with the shrinkage of a-axis while resistivity increases with the enlargement of c-axis. A global critical current density of 1.1x10^4 A/cm^2 at 5 K in self field was achieved in the purest sample. A method of characterization of inter-grain current density is proposed. This method gives an inter-grain Jc of 3.6x10^3 A/cm^2 at 5 K in self field, in contrast to the intra-grain Jc of 10^6 A/cm^2. The effect of composition gradients on the inter-grain Jc in SmO1-xFxFeAs is also discussed. 
0808.03667	Supersymmetry and Polytopes	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Luis J. Boya	Abstract:  We make an imaginative comparison between the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and the 24-cell polytope in four dimensions, the Octacube. 
0808.03668	The FIRST-2MASS Red Quasar Survey II: An anomalously high fraction of LoBALs in searches for dust-reddened quasars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Tanya Urrutia, Robert H. Becker, Richard L. White, Eilat Glikman, Mark Lacy, Jacqueline Hodge, Michael D. Gregg	Abstract:  We present results on a survey to find extremely dust-reddened Type-1 Quasars. Combining the FIRST radio survey, the 2MASS Infrared Survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we have selected a candidate list of 122 potential red quasars. With more than 80% spectroscopically identified objects, well over 50% are classified as dust-reddened Type 1 quasars, whose reddenings (E(B-V)) range from approximately 0.1 to 1.5 magnitudes. They lie well off the color selection windows usually used to detect quasars and many fall within the stellar locus, which would have made it impossible to find these objects with traditional color selection techniques. The reddenings found are much more consistent with obscuration happening in the host galaxy rather than stemming from the dust torus. We find an unusually high fraction of Broad Absorption Line (BAL) quasars at high redshift, all but one of them belonging to the Low Ionization BAL (LoBAL) class and many also showing absorption the metastable FeII line (FeLoBAL). The discovery of further examples of dust-reddened LoBAL quasars provides more support for the hypothesis that BAL quasars (at least LoBAL quasars) represent an early stage in the lifetime of the quasar. The fact that we see such a high fraction of BALs could indicate that the quasar is in a young phase in which quasar feedback from the BAL winds is suppressing star formation in the host galaxy. 
0808.03669	A Roche Model for Uniformly Rotating Rings	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Stefan Horatschek, David Petroff	Abstract:  A Roche model for describing uniformly rotating rings is presented and the results are compared with numerical solutions to the full problem for polytropic rings. In the thin ring limit, the surfaces of constant pressure including the surface of the ring itself are given in analytic terms, even in the mass-shedding case. 
0808.03670	Conductance through analytic constrictions	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:D. Koudela, A.-M. Uimonen, H. Häkkinen	Abstract:  We study the dependence of the intrinsic conductance of a nanocontact on its shape by using the recursion-transfer-matrix method. Hour-glass, torus, and spherical shapes are defined through analytic potentials, the latter two serving as rough models for ring-like and spherical molecules, respectively. The sensitivity of the conductance to geometric details is analyzed and discussed. Strong resonance effects are found for a spherical contact weakly coupled to electron reservoirs. 
0808.03671	Doping evolution of the electronic specific heat coefficient in slightly-doped La2-xSrxCuO4 single crystals	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Seiki Komiya, I. Tsukada	Abstract:  Detailed doping dependence of the electronic specific heat coefficient gamma is studied for La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) single crystals in the slightly-doped regime. We find that gamma systematically increases with doping, and furthermore, even for the samples in the antiferromagnetic (AF) regime, gamma already acquires finite value and grows with x. This suggests that finite electronic density of states (DOS) is created in the AF regime where the transport shows strong localization at low temperatures, and this means the system is not a real insulator with a clear gap even though it still keeps long range AF order. 
0808.03672	How to calculate colourful cross sections efficiently	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Tanju Gleisberg, Stefan Hoeche, Frank Krauss	Abstract:  Different methods for the calculation of cross sections with many QCD particles are compared. To this end, CSW vertex rules, Berends-Giele recursion and Feynman-diagram based techniques are implemented as well as various methods for the treatment of colours and phase space integration. We find that typically there is only a small window of jet multiplicities, where the CSW technique has efficiencies comparable or better than both of the other two methods. 
0808.03673	AGILE detection of variable gamma-ray activity from the blazar S5 0716+714 during September-October 2007	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:F. D'Ammando, A. W. Chen, M. Villata, C. M. Raiteri, V. Vittorini, A. Bulgarelli, I. Donnarumma, A. Giuliani, F. Longo, L. Pacciani, G. Pucella, M. Tavani, S. Vercellone	Abstract:  We report the gamma-ray activity from the Intermediate BL Lac S5 0716+714 during 2007 September-October observations by the AGILE satellite, coincident with a period of intense optical activity of the source monitored by GASP-WEBT. AGILE observed the source with its two co-aligned imagers, the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) and the hard X-ray imager (Super-AGILE) sensitive in the energy range 30 MeV-50 GeV and 18-60 keV respectively, in two different periods: the first between 4 and 23 September 2007, the second between 24 October and 1 November 2007. Over the period 7-12 September, AGILE detected gamma-ray emission from the source at a significance level of 9.6-sigma with an average flux (E>100 MeV) of (97+/-15) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}, increasing by a factor of at least four within three days. No emission was detected by Super-AGILE in the energy range 18-60 keV, with a 3-sigma upper limit of 10 mCrab in 335 ksec. The gamma-ray flux of S5 0716+714 detected by AGILE is the highest ever detected for this blazar and one of the most intense gamma-ray fluxes detected from a BL Lac object. The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of mid-September seems to be consistent with the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission model, but only by including two SSC components with different variability. In October 2007 AGILE repointed toward S5 0716+714 following an intense optical flare, measuring an average flux of (47+/-11) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} at a significance level of 6.0-sigma. The gamma-ray flux during both AGILE pointings appears to be highly variable on timescales of 1 day. 
0808.03674	Comix, a new matrix element generator	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Tanju Gleisberg, Stefan Hoeche	Abstract:  We present a new tree-level matrix element generator, based on the colour dressed Berends-Giele recursive relations.

Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Andrew Das Arulsamy, Marco Fronzi	Abstract:  Electrons are indistinguishable, but the energy of each electron is different in different materials and if we can exploit this energy, then we can systematically study the changes of electronic properties in non free-electron metals. 
0808.03676	Pseudocyclic association schemes and strongly regular graphs	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Akihiro Munemasa, Takuya Ikuta	Abstract:  Let X be a pseudocyclic association scheme in which all the nontrivial relations are strongly regular graphs with the same eigenvalues. We prove that the principal part of the first eigenmatrix of X is a linear combination of an incidence matrix of a symmetric design and the all-ones matrix. Amorphous pseudocyclic association schemes are examples of such association schemes whose associated symmetric design is trivial. We present several non-amorphous examples, which are either cyclotomic association schemes, or their fusion schemes. Special properties of symmetric designs guarantee the existence of further fusions, and the two known non-amorphous association schemes of class 4 discovered by van Dam and by the authors, are recovered in this way. We also give another pseudocyclic non-amorphous association scheme of class 7 on GF(2^{21}), and a new pseudocyclic amorphous association scheme of class 5 on GF(2^{12}). 
0808.03677	Study of Ω_c^0 and Ω_c^{*0} Baryons at Belle	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:E.Solovieva, R.Chistov, et al., for the Belle Collaboration	Abstract:  We report results from a study of the charmed double strange baryons Ω_c^0 and Ω_c^{*0} at Belle. The Ω_c^0 is reconstructed using the Ω_c^0 --> Ω^- π^+ decay mode, and its mass is measured to be (2693.6 \pm 0.3 {+1.8 \atop -1.5}) MeV/c^2. The Ω_c^{*0} baryon is reconstructed in the Ω_c^0 γmode. The mass difference M_{Ω_c^{*0}} - M_{Ω_c^0} is measured to be (70.7 \pm 0.9 {+0.1 \atop -0.9}) MeV/c^2. The analysis is performed using 673 fb^{-1} of data on and near the Υ(4S) collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e^+e^- collider. 
0808.03678	Entanglement control in one-dimensional $s=1/2$ random XY spin chain	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:C. J. Shan, W. W. Cheng, T. K. Liu, Y. X. Huang, H. Li	Abstract:  The entanglement in one-dimensional random XY spin systems where the impurities of exchange couplings and the external magnetic fields are considered as random variables is investigated by solving the different spin-spin correlation functions and the average magnetization per spin. The entanglement dynamics near particular locations of the system is also studied when the exchange couplings (or the external magnetic fields) satisfy three different distributions(the Gaussian distribution, double-Gaussian distribution, and bimodal distribution). We find that the entanglement can be controlled by varying the strength of external magnetic field and the different distributions of impurities. Moreover, the entanglement of some nearest-neighboring qubits can be increased for certain parameter values of the three different distributions. 
0808.03679	Mean-field dynamics of a two-mode Bose-Einstein condensate subject to noise and dissipation	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:F. Trimborn, D. Witthaut, S. Wimberger	Abstract:  We discuss the dynamics of an open two-mode Bose-Hubbard system subject to phase noise and particle dissipation. Starting from the full many-body dynamics described by a master equation the mean-field limit is derived resulting in an effective non-hermitian (discrete) Gross-Pitaevskii equation which has been introduced only phenomenologically up to now. The familiar mean-field phase space structure is substantially altered by the dissipation. Especially the character of the fixed points shows an abrupt transition from elliptic or hyperbolic to attractiv or repulsive, respectively. This reflects the metastable behaviour of the corresponding many-body system which surprisingly also leads to a significant increase of the purity of the condensate. A comparison of the mean-field approximation to simulations of the full master equation using the Monte Carlo wave function method shows an excellent agreement for wide parameter ranges. 
0808.03680	Two effects relevant for the study of astrophysical reaction rates: gamma transitions in capture reactions and Coulomb suppression of the stellar enhancement	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:T. Rauscher (U. Basel)    	Abstract:  Nucleosynthesis processes involve reactions on several thousand nuclei, both close to and far off stability. The preparation of reaction rates to be used in astrophysical investigations requires experimental and theoretical input. In this context, two interesting aspects are discussed: (i) the relevant gamma transition energies in astrophysical capture reactions, and (ii) the newly discovered Coulomb suppression of the stellar enhancement factor. The latter makes a number of reactions with negative Q value more favorable for experimental investigation than their inverse reactions, contrary to common belief. 
0808.03681	Triangulated structures induced by simplicial descent categories	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Beatriz Rodriguez Gonzalez	Abstract:  The present paper is devoted to study the homotopy category associated with a simplicial descent category (D,s,E) (arXiv:0808.3684v2). We prove that the class E of equivalences has a calculus of left fractions over a quotient category of D modulo homotopy. We study the fiber/cofiber sequences induced by a (co)simplicial descent structure. Examples of such fiber/cofiber sequences are deduced for (commutative) differential graded algebras, simplicial sets or topological spaces. We prove that the homotopy category of a stable simplicial descent category is triangulated. In addition, these triangulated structures may be extended to the homotopy categories of diagram categories of D. As a corollary, we obtain the triangulated structures on: (filtered) derived categories of abelian categories, the derived category of DG-modules over a DG-category, the stable derived category of fibrant spectra and the localized category of mixed Hodge complexes. 
0808.03682	The entanglement in one-dimensional random XY spin chain with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:C.J.Shan, W.W.Cheng, T.K.Liu, Y.X.Huang, H.Li	Abstract:  The impurities of exchange couplings, external magnetic fields and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya (DM) interaction considered as Gaussian distribution, the entanglement in one-dimensional random $XY$ spin systems is investigated by the method of solving the different spin-spin correlation functions and the average magnetization per spin. The entanglement dynamics at central locations of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic chains have been studied by varying the three impurities and the strength of DM interaction. (i) For ferromagnetic spin chain, the weak DM interaction can improve the amount of entanglement to a large value, and the impurities have the opposite effect on the entanglement below and above critical DM interaction. (ii) For antiferromagnetic spin chain, DM interaction can enhance the entanglement to a steady value. Our results imply that DM interaction strength, the impurity and exchange couplings (or magnetic field) play competing roles in enhancing quantum entanglement. 
0808.03683	Constraints on the star formation histories of galaxies from z~1 to z~0	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yan-Mei Chen, Vivienne Wild, Guinevere Kauffmann, Jeremy Blaizot, Marc Davis, Kai Noeske, Jian-Min Wang, Christopher Willmer	Abstract:  We present a new method to estimate the average star formation rate per unit stellar mass (SSFR) of a stacked population of galaxies. We combine the spectra of 600-1000 galaxies with similar stellar masses and parameterise the star formation history of this stacked population using a set of exponentially declining functions. The strength of the Hydrogen Balmer absorption line series in the rest-frame wavelength range 3750-4150Åis used to constrain the SSFR by comparing with a library of models generated using the BC03 stellar population code. Our method, based on a principal component analysis (PCA), can be applied in a consistent way to spectra drawn from local galaxy surveys and from surveys at $z \sim 1$, and is only weakly influenced by attenuation due to dust. We apply our method to galaxy samples drawn from SDSS and DEEP2 to study mass-dependent growth of galaxies from $z \sim 1$ to $z \sim 0$. We find that, (1) high mass galaxies have lower SSFRs than low mass galaxies; (2) the average SSFR has decreased from $z=1$ to $z=0$ by a factor of $\sim 3-4$, independent of galaxy mass. Additionally, at $z \sim 1$ our average SSFRs are a factor of $2-2.5$ lower than those derived from multi-wavelength photometry using similar datasets. We then compute the average time (in units of the Hubble time, $t_{\rm H}(z)$) needed by galaxies of a given mass to form their stars at their current rate. At both $z=0$ and at $z=1$, this timescale decreases strongly with stellar mass from values close to unity for galaxies with masses $\sim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$, to more than ten for galaxies more massive than $ 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. Our results are in good agreement with models in which AGN feedback is more efficient at preventing gas from cooling and forming stars in high mass galaxies. 
0808.03684	(Co)Simplicial Descent Categories	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Beatriz Rodriguez Gonzalez	Abstract:  In this paper we study the question of how to transfer homotopic structure from the category sD of simplicial objects in a fixed category D to D. To this end we use a sort of homotopy colimit s : sD --> D, which we call simple functor. For instance, the Bousfield-Kan homotopy colimit in a Quillen simplicial model category is an example of simple functor. As a remarkable example outside the setting of Quillen models we include Deligne simple of mixed Hodge complexes. We prove here that the simple functor induces an equivalence on the corresponding localized categories. We also describe a natural structure of Brown category of cofibrant objects on sD. We use these facts to produce cofiber sequences on the localized category of D by E, which give rise to a natural Verdier triangulated structure in the stable case. 
0808.03685	Asymptotic behaviour of thermoviscoelastic Berger plate	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Mykhailo Potomkin	Abstract:  System of partial differential equations with a convolution terms and non-local nonlinearity describing oscillations of plate due to Berger approach and with accounting for thermal regime in terms of Coleman-Gurtin and Gurtin-Pipkin law and fading memory of material is considered. The equation is transformed into a dynamical system in a suitable Hilbert space which asymptotic behaviour is analysed. Existence of the compact global attractor in this dynamical system and some of its properties are proved in this article. Main tool in analysis of asymptotic behaviour is stabilizability inequality. 
0808.03686	Entanglement and quantum phase transition in alternating XY spin chain with next-nearest neighbour interactions	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:C. J. Shan, W. W. Cheng, T. K. Liu, Y. X. Huang, H. Li	Abstract:  By using the method of density-matrix renormalization-group to solve the different spin-spin correlation functions, the nearest-neighbouring entanglement(NNE) and next-nearest-neighbouring entanglement(NNNE) of one-dimensional alternating Heisenberg XY spin chain is investigated in the presence of alternating nearest neighbour interactions of exchange couplings, external magnetic fields and next-nearest neighbouring interactions. For dimerized ferromagnetic spin chain, NNNE appears only above the critical dimerized interaction, meanwhile, the dimerized interaction effects quantum phase transition point and improves NNNE to a large value. We also study the effect of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic next-nearest neighboring (NNN) interactions on the dynamics of NNE and NNNE. The ferromagnetic NNN interaction increases and shrinks NNE below and above critical frustrated interaction respectively, while the antiferromagnetic NNN interaction always decreases NNE. The antiferromagnetic NNN interaction results to a larger value of NNNE in comparison to the case when the NNN interaction is ferromagnetic. 
0808.03687	The quantum critical point in CeRhIn_5: a resistivity study	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Georg Knebel, Dai Aoki, Jean-Pascal Brison, Jacques Flouquet	Abstract:  The pressure--temperature phase diagram of CeRhIn_5 has been studied under high magnetic field by resistivity measurements. Clear signatures of a quantum critical point has been found at a critical pressure of p_c = 2.5 GPa. The field induced magnetic state in the superconducting state is stable up to the highest field. At p_c the antiferromagnetic ground-state under high magnetic field collapses very rapidly. Clear signatures of p_c are the strong enhancement of the resistivity in the normal state and of the inelastic scattering term. No clear T2 temperature dependence could be found for pressures above T_c. From the analysis of the upper critical field within a strong coupling model we present the pressure dependence of the coupling parameter lambda and the gyromagnetic ratio g. No signatures of a spatially modulated order parameter could be evidenced. A detailed comparison with the magnetic field--temperature phase diagram of CeCoIn_5 is given. The comparison between CeRhIn_5 and CeCoIn_5 points out the importance to take into account the field dependence of the effective mass in the calculation of the superconducting upper critical field H_c2. It suggests also that when the magnetic critical field H_(0) becomes lower than H_c2 (0)$, the persistence of a superconducting pseudo-gap may stick the antiferromagnetism to H_c2 (0). 
0808.03688	Quantum Tunneling and Trace Anomaly	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Rabin Banerjee, Bibhas Ranjan Majhi	Abstract:  We compute the corrections, using the tunneling formalisim based on a quantum WKB approach, to the Hawking temperature and Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for the Schwarzschild black hole. The results are related to the trace anomaly and are shown to be equivalent to findings inferred from Hawking's original calculation based on path integrals using zeta function regularization. Finally, exploiting the corrected temperature and periodicity arguments we also find the modification to the original Schwarzschild metric which captures the effect of quantum corrections. 
0808.03689	Optimal Power Allocation for Fading Channels in Cognitive Radio Networks: Ergodic Capacity and Outage Capacity	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Xin Kang, Ying-Chang Liang, Arumugam Nallanathan, Hari Krishna Garg, Rui Zhang	Abstract:  A cognitive radio network (CRN) is formed by either allowing the secondary users (SUs) in a secondary communication network (SCN) to opportunistically operate in the frequency bands originally allocated to a primary communication network (PCN) or by allowing SCN to coexist with the primary users (PUs) in PCN as long as the interference caused by SCN to each PU is properly regulated. In this paper, we consider the latter case, known as spectrum sharing, and study the optimal power allocation strategies to achieve the ergodic capacity and the outage capacity of the SU fading channel under different types of power constraints and fading channel models. In particular, besides the interference power constraint at PU, the transmit power constraint of SU is also considered. Since the transmit power and the interference power can be limited either by a peak or an average constraint, various combinations of power constraints are studied. It is shown that there is a capacity gain for SU under the average over the peak transmit/interference power constraint. It is also shown that fading for the channel between SU transmitter and PU receiver is usually a beneficial factor for enhancing the SU channel capacities. 
0808.03690	Entanglement dynamics of two-qubit system in different types of noisy channels	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:C. J. Shan, J. B. Liu, W. W. Cheng, T. K. Liu, Y. X. Huang, H. Li	Abstract:  In this paper, we study entanglement dynamics of a two-qubit extended Werner-like state locally interacting with independent noisy channels, i.e., amplitude damping, phase damping and depolarizing channels. We show that the purity of initial entangled state has direct impacts on the entanglement robustness in each noisy channel. That is, if the initial entangled state is prepared in mixed instead of pure form, the state may exhibit entanglement sudden death (ESD) and/or be decreased for the critical probability at which the entanglement disappear. 
0808.03691	Towards relating the kappa-symmetric and pure-spinor versions of the supermembrane	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Mirela Babalic, Niclas Wyllard	Abstract:  We study the relation between the kappa-symmetric formulation of the supermembrane in eleven dimensions and the pure-spinor version. Recently, Berkovits related the Green-Schwarz and pure-spinor superstrings. In this paper, we attempt to extend this method to the supermembrane. We show that it is possible to reinstate the reparameterisation constraints in the pure-spinor formulation of the supermembrane by introducing a topological sector and performing a similarity transformation. The resulting BRST charge is then of conventional type and is argued to be (related to) the BRST charge of the kappa-symmetric supermembrane in a formulation where all second class constraints are 'gauge unfixed' to first class constraints. In our analysis we also encounter a natural candidate for a (non-covariant) supermembrane analogue of the superstring b ghost. 
0808.03692	Dynamical suppression of non-adiabatic modes	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Massimo Giovannini	Abstract:  Recent analyses of the WMAP 5-year data constrain possible non-adiabatic contributions to the initial conditions of CMB anisotropies. Depending upon the early dynamics of the plasma, the amplitude of the entropic modes can experience a different suppression by the time of photon decoupling. Explicit examples of the latter observation are presented both analytically and numerically when the post-inflationary dynamics is dominated by a stiff contribution. 
0808.03693	Providing Virtual Execution Environments: A Twofold Illustration	Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC)	Authors:Xavier Grehant, J.M. Dana	Abstract:  Platform virtualization helps solving major grid computing challenges: share resource with flexible, user-controlled and custom execution environments and in the meanwhile, isolate failures and malicious code. Grid resource management tools will evolve to embrace support for virtual resource. We present two open source projects that transparently supply virtual execution environments. Tycoon has been developed at HP Labs to optimise resource usage in creating an economy where users bid to access virtual machines and compete for CPU cycles. SmartDomains provides a peer-to-peer layer that automates virtual machines deployment using a description language and deployment engine from HP Labs. These projects demonstrate both client-server and peer-to-peer approaches to virtual resource management. The first case makes extensive use of virtual machines features for dynamic resource allocation. The second translates virtual machines capabilities into a sophisticated language where resource management components can be plugged in configurations and architectures defined at deployment time. We propose to share our experience at CERN openlab developing SmartDomains and deploying Tycoon to give an illustrative introduction to emerging research in virtual resource management. 
0808.03694	Studying Geometric Graph Properties of Road Networks Through an Algorithmic Lens	Computational Geometry (cs.CG)	Authors:David Eppstein, Michael T. Goodrich	Abstract:  This paper studies real-world road networks from an algorithmic perspective, focusing on empirical studies that yield useful properties of road networks that can be exploited in the design of fast algorithms that deal with geographic data. Unlike previous approaches, our study is not based on the assumption that road networks are planar graphs. Indeed, based on the a number of experiments we have performed on the road networks of the 50 United States and District of Columbia, we provide strong empirical evidence that road networks are quite non-planar. Our approach therefore instead is directed at finding algorithmically-motivated properties of road networks as non-planar geometric graphs, focusing on alternative properties of road networks that can still lead to efficient algorithms for such problems as shortest paths and Voronoi diagrams. In particular, we study road networks as multiscale-dispersed graphs, which is a concept we formalize in terms of disk neighborhood systems. This approach allows us to develop fast algorithms for road networks without making any additional assumptions about the distribution of edge weights. In fact, our algorithms can allow for non-metric weights. 
0808.03695	Planning Curricular Proposals on Sound and Music with Prospective Secondary-School Teachers	Physics Education (physics.ed-ph)	Authors:Erica Bisesi, Marisa Michelini	Abstract:  Sound is a preferred context to build foundations on wave phenomena, one of the most important disciplinary referents in physics. It is also one of the best-set frameworks to achieve transversality, overcoming scholastic level and activating emotional aspects which are naturally connected with every day life, as well as with music and perception. Looking at sound and music by a transversal perspective - a border-line approach between science and art, is the adopted statement for a teaching proposal using meta-cognition as a strategy in scientific education. This work analyzes curricular proposals on musical acoustics, planned by prospective secondary-school teachers in the framework of a Formative Intervention Module answering the expectation of making more effective teaching scientific subjects by improving creative capabilities, as well as leading to build logical and scientific categorizations able to consciously discipline artistic activity in music students. With this aim, a particular emphasis is given to those concepts - like sound parameters and structural elements of a musical piece, which are best fitted to be addressed on a transversal perspective, involving simultaneously physics, psychophysics and music. 
0808.03696	Higgs Boson Production in Association with Multiple Hard Jets	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Jeppe R. Andersen (CERN), Vittorio Del Duca (Frascati), Chris D. White (NIKHEF, Amsterdam)    	Abstract:  We elucidate a new technique for estimating the production of multiple (at least two) hard jets in Higgs production via gluon-gluon fusion. The approach is based upon high energy factorisation, with the region of applicability extended by constraints on the analytic behaviour of the scattering amplitudes stemming from known all-order results. The method approximates both real and virtual corrections, and allows for the resummation in an n-parton inclusive event sample of the terms dominant in the high energy limit. The resulting approximation is matched to the known tree level matrix elements for the production of a Higgs boson in association with 2 and 3 jets, and implemented in a Monte Carlo generator. Example results are presented and characteristic radiation patterns discussed. 
0808.03697	Asymptotics of randomly stopped sums in the presence of heavy tails	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Denis Denisov, Sergey Foss, Dmitry Korshunov	Abstract:  We study conditions under which $P(S_τ>x)\sim P(M_τ>x)\sim Eτ P(ξ_1>x)$ as $x\to\infty$, where $S_τ$ is a sum $ξ_1+...+ξ_τ$ of random size $τ$ and $M_τ$ is a maximum of partial sums $M_τ=\max_{n\leτ}S_n$. Here $ξ_n$, $n=1$, 2, ..., are independent identically distributed random variables whose common distribution is assumed to be subexponential. We consider mostly the case where $τ$ is independent of the summands; also, in a particular situation, we deal with a stopping time. Also we consider the case where $Eξ>0$ and where the tail of $τ$ is comparable with or heavier than that of $ξ$, and obtain the asymptotics $P(S_τ>x) \sim EτP(ξ_1>x)+P(τ>x/Eξ)$ as $x\to\infty$. This case is of a primary interest in the branching processes. In addition, we obtain new uniform (in all $x$ and $n$) upper bounds for the ratio $P(S_n>x)/P(ξ_1>x)$ which substantially improve Kesten's bound in the subclass ${\mathcal S}^*$ of subexponential distributions. 
0808.03698	Monopoles in the presence of the Chern-Simons term via the Julia-Toulouse approach	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:L. S. Grigorio, M. S. Guimaraes, C. Wotzasek	Abstract:  We study $QED_3$ with magnetic-like defects using the Julia-Toulouse condensation mechanism (JTM). By a careful treatment of the symmetries we suggest a geometrical interpretation for distinct debatable issues in the MCS-monopole system: (i) the induction of the non-conserved electric current together with the Chern-Simons term (CS), (ii) the deconfinement transition and, (iii) the computation of the fermionic determinant in the presence of Dirac string singularities. The JTM leads to proper interpretation of the non-conserved current as originating from Dirac brane symmetry breaking. The mechanism behind this symmetry breaking is clarified. The physical origin of the deconfinement transition becomes evident in the low energy effective theory induced by the JTM. The proper procedure to compute the fermionic determinant in the presence of Dirac branes will be presented. A byproduct of this approach is the possible appearance of statistical transmutation and the clarification for the different quantization rules for the topological mass. 
0808.03699	Difficulties with Collapse Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Casey Blood	Abstract:  Quantum mechanics gives many versions of reality but we perceive only one. One potential explanation for this, the one considered here, is that the wave function collapses down to just one version. The experimental situation is briefly reviewed, with no evidence found for collapse. The theoretical position is also reviewed and found wanting. Collapse-by-observation schemes are logically untenable. A mathematical theory of collapse must be nonlinear, a significant departure from current quantum theory. In addition, the primary candidate theory, the GRW-Pearle model, requires instantaneous, non-local transmission of information. It also requires transmission of information across versions of reality, which is forbidden in current quantum mechanics. And there is no apparent physical quantity, such as particle number, that can provide the mechanism for collapse in all cases. Further, these aspects, which are in disagreement with current theory, seem to be necessary for any mathematical theory of collapse. The conclusion is that the outlook for mathematical collapse schemes is not encouraging. 
0808.03700	Survival probability in diffractive dijet photoproduction	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:M. Klasen (LPSC Grenoble), G. Kramer (Univ. Hamburg)    	Abstract:  We confront the latest H1 and ZEUS data on diffractive dijet photoproduction with next-to-leading order QCD predictions in order to determine whether a rapidity gap survival probability of less than one is supported by the data. We find evidence for this hypothesis when assuming global factorization breaking for both the direct and resolved photon contributions, in which case the survival probability would have to be E_T^jet-dependent, and for the resolved or in addition the related direct initial-state singular contribution only, where it would be independent of E_T^jet. 
0808.03701	Crossing the Phantom Divide Line in a DGP-Inspired $F(R,φ)$-Gravity	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Kourosh Nozari, Mahin Pourghasemi	Abstract:  We study possible crossing of the phantom divide line in a DGP-inspired $F(R,φ)$ braneworld scenario where scalar field and curvature quintessence are treated in a unified framework. With some specific form of $F(R,φ)$ and by adopting a suitable ansatz, we show that there are appropriate regions of the parameters space which account for late-time acceleration and admit crossing of the phantom divide line. 
0808.03702	Quantum Hall to Insulator Transition in the Bilayer Quantum Hall Ferromagnet	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Ganpathy Murthy, Subir Sachdev	Abstract:  We describe a new phase transition of the bilayer quantum Hall ferromagnet at filling fraction $ν= 1$. In the presence of static disorder (modeled by a periodic potential), bosonic $S=1/2$ spinons can undergo a superfluid-insulator transition while preserving the ferromagnetic order. The Mott insulating phase has an emergent U(1) photon, and the transition is between Higgs and Coulomb phases of this photon. Physical consequences for charge and counterflow conductivity, and for interlayer tunneling conductance in the presence of quenched disorder are discussed. 
0808.03703	Scalar and gauge translation-invariant noncommutative models	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Adrian Tanasa	Abstract:  We make here a short overview of the recent developments regarding translation-invariant models on the noncommutative Moyal space. A scalar model was first proposed and proved renormalizable. Its one-loop renormalization group flow and parametric representation were calculated. Furthermore, a mechanism to take its commutative limit was recently given. Finally, a proposition for a renormalizable, translation-invariant gauge model was made. 
0808.03704	Polygonal excitations of spinning and levitating droplets	Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)	Authors:R. J. A. Hill, L. Eaves	Abstract:  The shape of a weightless spinning liquid droplet is governed by the balance between the surface tension and centrifugal forces. The axisymmetric shape for slow rotation becomes unstable to a non-axisymmetric distortion above a critical angular velocity, beyond which the droplet progresses through a series of 2-lobed shapes. Theory predicts the existence of a family of 3- and 4-lobed equilibrium shapes at higher angular velocity. We investigate the formation of a triangular-shaped magnetically levitated water droplet, driven to rotate by the Lorentz force on an ionic current within the droplet. We also study equatorial traveling waves which give the droplet 3, 4 and 5-fold symmetry. 
0808.03705	Current Fluctuations in Rough Superconducting Tunnel Junctions	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Georg Heinrich, F. K. Wilhelm	Abstract:  Intrinsic noise is known to be ubiquitous in Josephson junctions. We investigate a voltage biased superconducting tunnel junction including a very small number of pinholes - transport channels possessing a transmission coefficient close to unity. Although few of these pinholes contribute very little to the conductance, they can dominate current fluctuations in the low-voltage regime. We show that even fully transparent transport channels between superconductors contribute to shot noise due to the uncertainty in the number of Andreev cycles. We discuss shot noise enhancement by Multiple Andreev Reflection in such a junction and investigate whether pinholes might contribute as a microscopic mechanism of two-level current fluctuators. We discuss the connection of these results to the junction resonators observed in Josephson phase qubits. 
0808.03706	Theory of the nonsteady diffusion growth of a gas bubble in a supersaturated solution of gas in liquid	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:A. P. Grinin, F. M. Kuni, G. Yu. Gor	Abstract:  Using a self-similar approach a general nonsteady theory is elaborated for the case of the diffusion growth of a gas bubble in a supersaturated solution of gas in liquid. Due to the fact that the solution and the bubble in it are physically isolated, the self-similar approach accounts for the balance of the number of gas molecules in the solution and in the bubble that expells incompressible liquid solvent while growing. The rate of growth of the bubble radius in its dependence from gas solubility and solution supersaturation is obtained. There is a nonsteady effect of rapid increase of the rate of bubble growth simultaneous with the growth of the product of gas solubility and solution supersaturation. This product is supplied with a limitation from above, which also stipulates isothermal conditions of bubble growth. The smallness of gas solubility is not presupposed. 
0808.03707	X-ray clusters of galaxies in conformal gravity	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Antonaldo Diaferio (1,2), Luisa Ostorero (1,2) ((1) Dip. Fisica Generale (U. Torino) (2) INFN (Torino))    	Abstract:  We run adiabatic N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of isolated self-gravitating gas clouds to test whether conformal gravity, an alternative theory to General Relativity, is able to explain the properties of X-ray galaxy clusters without resorting to dark matter. We show that the gas clouds rapidly reach equilibrium with a density profile which is well fit by a beta-model whose normalization and slope are in approximate agreement with observations. However, conformal gravity fails to yield the observed thermal properties of the gas cloud: (i) the mean temperature is at least an order of magnitude larger than observed; (ii) the temperature profiles increase with the square of the distance from the cluster center, in clear disagreement with real X-ray clusters. These results depend on a gravitational potential whose parameters reproduce the velocity rotation curves of spiral galaxies. However, this parametrization stands on an arbitrarily chosen conformal factor. It remains to be seen whether a different conformal factor, specified by a spontaneous breaking of the conformal symmetry, can reconcile this theory with observations. 
0808.03708	Collectivity-induced quenching of signatures for shell closures	Nuclear Theory (nucl-th)	Authors:M. Bender, G.F. Bertsch, P.-H. Heenen	Abstract:  Mass differences are an often used as signature and measure for shell closure. Using the angular-momentum projected Generator Coordinate Method and the Skyrme interaction SLy4, we analyze the modification of mass differences due to static deformation and dynamic fluctuations around the mean-field ground state. 
0808.03709	Entanglement dynamics and Bell Violations of two atoms in Tavis-Cummings model with phase decoherence	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:C. J. Shan, W. W. Cheng, T. K. Liu, D. J. Guo, Y. J. Xia	Abstract:  Considering the dipole-dipole coupling intensity between two atoms and the field in the Fock state, the entanglement dynamics between two atoms that are initially entangled in the system of two two-level atoms coupled to a single mode cavity in the presence of phase decoherence has been investigated. The two-atom entanglement appears with periodicity without considering phase decoherence, however, the phase decoherence causes the decay of entanglement between two atoms, with the increasing of the phase decoherence coefficient, the entanglement will quickly become a constant value, which is affected by the two-atom initial state, Meanwhile the two-atom quantum state will forever stay in the maximal entangled state when the initial state is proper even in the presence of phase decoherence. On the other hand, the Bell violation and the entanglement does not satisfy the monotonous relation, a large Bell violation implies the presence of a large amount of entanglement under certain conditions, while a large Bell violation corresponding to a little amount of entanglement in certain situations. However, the violation of Bell-CHSH inequality can reach the maximal value if two atoms are in the maximal entangled state, or vice versa. 
0808.03710	T-matrix approach to heavy quark diffusion in the QGP	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:H. van Hees, M. Mannarelli, Vincenzo Greco, Ralf Rapp	Abstract:  We assess transport properties of heavy quarks in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) using static heavy-quark (HQ) potentials from lattice-QCD calculations in a Brueckner many-body T-matrix approach to evaluate elastic heavy-quark-light-quark scattering amplitudes. In the attractive meson and diquark channels resonance states are formed for temperatures up to ~1.5 T_c, increasing pertinent drag and diffusion coefficients for heavy-quark rescattering in the QGP beyond the expectations from perturbative-QCD calculations. We use these transport coefficients, complemented with perturbative elastic HQ gluon scattering, in a relativistic Langevin simulation to obtain HQ p_t distributions and elliptic flow (v_2) under conditions relevant for the hot and dense medium created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. The heavy quarks are hadronized to open-charm and -bottom mesons within a combined quark-coalescence fragmentation scheme. The resulting single-electron spectra from their semileptonic decays are confronted with recent data on "non-photonic electrons" in 100 AGeV Au-Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). 
0808.03711	Average Structures of a Single Knotted Ring Polymer	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Shinya Saka, Hiroshi Takano	Abstract:  Two types of average structures of a single knotted ring polymer are studied by Brownian dynamics simulations. For a ring polymer with N segments, its structure is represented by a 3N -dimensional conformation vector consisting of the Cartesian coordinates of the segment positions relative to the center of mass of the ring polymer. The average structure is given by the average conformation vector, which is self-consistently defined as the average of the conformation vectors obtained from a simulation each of which is rotated to minimize its distance from the average conformation vector. From each conformation vector sampled in a simulation, 2N conformation vectors are generated by changing the numbering of the segments. Among the 2N conformation vectors, the one closest to the average conformation vector is used for one type of the average structure. The other type of the averages structure uses all the conformation vectors generated from those sampled in a simulation. In thecase of the former average structure, the knotted part of the average structure is delocalized for small N and becomes localized as N is increased. In the case of the latter average structure, the average structure changes from a double loop structure for small N to a single loop structure for large N, which indicates the localization-delocalization transition of the knotted part. 
0808.03712	Critique du rapport signal à bruit en communications numériques -- Questioning the signal to noise ratio in digital communications	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Michel Fliess (LIX, INRIA Saclay - Ile de France)    	Abstract:  The signal to noise ratio, which plays such an important rôle in information theory, is shown to become pointless for digital communications where the demodulation is achieved via new fast estimation techniques. Operational calculus, differential algebra, noncommutative algebra and nonstandard analysis are the main mathematical tools. 
0808.03713	Nulling interferometry: performance comparison between space and ground-based sites for exozodiacal disc detection	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:D. Defrère, O. Absil, V. Coudé du Foresto, W.C. Danchi, R. den Hartog	Abstract:  Characterising the circumstellar dust around nearby main sequence stars is a necessary step in understanding the planetary formation process and is crucial for future life-finding space missions such as ESA's Darwin or NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF). Besides paving the technological way to Darwin/TPF, the space-based infrared interferometers Pegase and FKSI (Fourier-Kelvin Stellar Interferometer) will be valuable scientific precursors in that respect. In this paper, we investigate the performance of Pegase and FKSI for exozodiacal disc detection and compare the results with ground-based nulling interferometers. Besides their main scientific goal (characterising hot giant extrasolar planets), Pegase and FKSI are very efficient in assessing within a few minutes the level of circumstellar dust in the habitable zone around nearby main sequence stars. They are capable of detecting exozodiacal discs respectively 5 and 1 time as dense as the solar zodiacal cloud and they outperform any ground-based instrument. Unlike Pegase, FKSI can achieve this sensitivity for most targets of the Darwin/TPF catalogue thanks to an appropriate combination of baseline length and observing wavelength. The sensitivity of Pegase could, however, be significantly boosted by considering a shorter interferometric baseline length. These space-based interferometers would be complementary to Antarctica-based instruments in terms of sky coverage and would be ideal instruments for preparing future life-finding space missions. 
0808.03714	On nonadiabatic calculation of dipole moments	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Francisco M. Fernandez	Abstract:  We show that a recent non Born--Oppenheimer calculation of dipole moments exhibits obscure points and is not consistent with the well known Hellmann--Feynman theorem. 
0808.03715	Nanostructure and related mechanical properties of an Al-Mg-Si alloy processed by severe plastic deformation	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Gulnaz Nurislamova (GPM, IPAM), Xavier Sauvage (GPM), Maxim Murashkin (IPAM), Rinat Islamgaliev (IPAM), Ruslan Valiev (IPAM)    	Abstract:  Microstructural features and mechanical properties of an Al-Mg-Si alloy processed by high-pressure torsion have been investigated using transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, three-dimensional atom probe, tensile tests and microhardness measurements. It is shown that HPT processing of the Al-Mg-Si alloy leads to a much stronger grain size refinement than of pure aluminium (down to 100 nm). Moreover, massive segregation of alloying elements along grain boundaries is observed. This nanostructure exhibits a yield stress even two times higher than that after a standard T6 heat treatment of the coarse grained alloy 
0808.03716	Precipitate stability and recrystallisation in the weld nuggets of friction stir welded Al-Mg-Si and Al-Mg-Sc alloys	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Xavier Sauvage (GPM), Anite Dédé (GPM), Alexandra Cabello Muñoz (UMR CNRS 6183), Bertrand Huneau (UMR CNRS 6183)    	Abstract:  Two different precipitate hardening aluminium alloys processed by friction stir welding were investigated. The microstructure and the hardness of the as delivered materials were compared to that of the weld nugget. Transmission electron microscopy observations combined with three-dimensional atom probe analyses clearly show that β;" precipitates dissolved in the nugget of the Al-Mg-Si giving rise to some supersaturated solid solution. It is shown that the dramatic softening of the weld could be partly recovered by post-welding ageing treatments. In the Al-Mg-Sc alloy, Al3Sc precipitate size and density are unchanged in the nugget comparing to the base metal. These precipitates strongly reduce the boundary mobility of recrystallised grains, leading to a grain size in the nugget much smaller than in the Al-Mg-Si alloy. Both coherent and incoherent precipitates were detected. This feature may indicate that a combination of continuous and discontinuous recrystallisation occurred in the weld nugget. 
0808.03717	Free and Open Source Software for Development	General Literature (cs.GL)	Authors:Victor van Reijswoud, Arjan de Jager	Abstract:  Development organizations and International Non-Governmental Organizations have been emphasizing the high potential of Free and Open Source Software for the Less Developed Countries. Cost reduction, less vendor dependency and increased potential for local capacity development have been their main arguments. In spite of its advantages, Free and Open Source Software is not widely adopted at the African continent. In this book the authors will explore the grounds on with these expectations are based. Where do they come from and is there evidence to support these expectations? Over the past years several projects have been initiated and some good results have been achieved, but at the same time many challenges were encountered. What lessons can be drawn from these experiences and do these experiences contain enough evidence to support the high expectations? Several projects and their achievements will be considered. In the final part of the book the future of Free and Open Source Software for Development will be explored. Special attention is given to the African continent since here challenges are highest. What is the role of Free and open Source Software for Development and how do we need to position and explore the potential? What are the threats? The book aims at professionals that are engaged in the design and implementation of ICT for Development (ICT4D) projects and want to improve their understanding of the role Free and Open Source Software can play. 
0808.03718	An X-ray photometry system I: Chandra ACIS	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:H.-J. Grimm, J. McDowell, G. Fabbiano, M. Elvis	Abstract:  We present a system of X-ray photometry for the Chandra satellite. X-ray photometry can be a powerful tool to obtain flux estimates, hardness ratios, and colors unbiased by assumptions about spectral shape and independent of temporal and spatial changes in instrument characteristics. The system we have developed relies on our knowledge of effective area and the energy-to-channel conversion to construct filters similar to photometric filters in the optical bandpass. We show that the filters are well behaved functions of energy and that this X-ray photometric system is able to reconstruct fluxes to within about 20%, without color corrections, for non-pathological spectra. Even in the worst cases it is better than 50%. Our method also treats errors in a consistent manner, both statistical as well as systematic. 
0808.03719	Radial quadrupole and scissors modes in trapped Fermi gases across the BCS phase transition	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Michael Urban	Abstract:  The excitation spectra of the radial quadrupole and scissors modes of ultracold Fermi gases in elongated traps are studied across the BCS superfluid-normal phase transition in the framework of a transport theory for quasiparticles. In the limit of zero temperature, this theory reproduces the results of superfluid hydrodynamics, while in the opposite limit, above the critical temperature, it reduces to the collisionless Vlasov equation. In the intermediate temperature range, the excitation spectra have two or three broad peaks, respectively, which are roughly situated at hydrodynamic and collisionless frequencies, and whose strength is shifted from the hydrodynamic to the collisionless modes with increasing temperature. By fitting the time dependent quadrupole deformation with a damped oscillation of a single frequency, we can understand the "jump" of the frequency of the radial quadrupole mode as a function of interaction strength which has recently been reported by the Innsbruck group. 
0808.03720	Light-matter excitations in the ultra-strong coupling regime	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Aji A. Anappara, Simone De Liberato (MPQ, LPA), Alessandro Tredicucci, Cristiano Ciuti (MPQ), Giorgio Biasiol, Lucia Sorba, Fabio Beltram	Abstract:  In a microcavity, light-matter coupling is quantified by the vacuum Rabi frequency $Ω_R$. When $Ω_R$ is larger than radiative and non-radiative loss rates, the system eigenstates (polaritons) are linear superposition of photonic and electronic excitations, a condition actively investigated in diverse physical implementations. Recently, a quantum electrodynamic regime (ultra-strong coupling) was predicted when $Ω_R$ becomes comparable to the transition frequency. Here we report unambiguous signatures of this regime in a quantum-well intersubband microcavity. Measuring the cavity-polariton dispersion in a room-temperature linear optical experiment, we directly observe the anti-resonant light-matter coupling and the photon-energy renormalization of the vacuum field. 
0808.03721	Integral formulation of 3-D Navier-Stokes and longer time existence of smooth solutions	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:O. Costin, G. Luo, S. Tanveer	Abstract:  We consider the 3-D Navier-Stokes initial value problem, $$ v_t - νΔ v = -\mathcal{P} [ v \cdot \nabla v ] + f , v(x, 0) = v_0 (x), x \in \mathbb{T}^3 (*) $$ where $\mathcal{P}$ is the Hodge projection. We assume that the Fourier transform norms $ \| {\hat f} \|_{l^1 (\mathbb{Z}^3)}$ and $\| {\hat v}_0 \|_{l^{1} (\mathbb{Z}^3)}$ are finite. Using an inverse Laplace transform approach, we prove that an integral equation equivalent to (*) has a unique solution ${\hat U} (k, q)$, exponentially bounded for $q$ in a sector centered on $\RR^+$, where $q$ is the inverse Laplace dual to $1/t^n$ for $n \ge 1$. This implies in particular local existence of a classical solution to (*) for $t \in (0, T)$, where $T$ depends on $\| {\hat v}_0 \|_{l^{1}}$ and $\| {\hat f} \|_{l^1}$. Global existence of the solution to NS follows if $\| {\hat U} (\cdot, q) \|_{l^1}$ has subexponential bounds as $q\to\infty$. If $f=0$, then the converse is also true: if NS has global solution, then there exists $n \ge 1 $ for which $\| {\hat U} (\cdot, q) \|$ necessarily decays. We show the exponential growth rate bound of U, α, can be better estimated based on the values of ${\hat U}$ on a finite interval $[0,q_0]$. We also show how the integral equation can be solved numerically with controlled errors. Preliminary numerical calculations suggest that this approach gives an existence time that substantially exceeds classical estimate. 
0808.03722	Imaging galactic diffuse gas: Bright, turbulent CO surrounding the line of sight to NRAO150	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jérôme Pety (IRAM, Lerma), Robert Lucas (IRAM), Harvey S. Liszt (NRAO)    	Abstract:  To understand the environment and extended structure of the host galactic gas whose molecular absorption line chemistry, we previously observed along the microscopic line of sight to the blazar/radiocontinuum source NRAO150 (aka B0355+508), we used the IRAM 30m Telescope and Plateau de Bure Interferometer to make two series of images of the host gas: i) 22.5 arcsec resolution single-dish maps of 12CO J=1-0 and 2-1 emission over a 220 arcsec by 220 arcsec field; ii) a hybrid (interferometer+singledish) aperture synthesis mosaic of 12CO J=1-0 emission at 5.8 arcsec resolution over a 90 arcsec-diameter region. CO components that are observed in absorption at a moderate optical depth (0.5) and are undetected in emission at 1 arcmin resolution toward NRAO 150 remain undetected at 6 arcsec resolution. This implies that they are not a previously-hidden large-scale molecular component revealed in absorption, but they do highlight the robustness of the chemistry into regions where the density and column density are too low to produce much rotational excitation, even in CO. Bright CO lines around NRAO150 most probably reflect the variation of a chemical process, i.e. the C+-CO conversion. However, the ultimate cause of the variations of this chemical process in such a limited field of view remains uncertain.

Ekstroem (4), G. Meynet (4), A. Maeder (4) ((1) Keele University, UK; (2) IPMU, Tokyo, Japan; (3) University of Basel, CH; (4) Geneva Observatory, CH; (5) Trieste Observatory, Italy)    	Abstract:  Massive stars played a key role in the early evolution of the Universe. They formed with the first halos and started the re-ionisation. It is therefore very important to understand their evolution. In this paper, we describe the strong impact of rotation induced mixing and mass loss at very low $Z$. The strong mixing leads to a significant production of primary nitrogen 14, carbon 13 and neon 22. Mass loss during the red supergiant stage allows the production of Wolf-Rayet stars, type Ib,c supernovae and possibly gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) down to almost Z=0 for stars more massive than 60 solar masses. Galactic chemical evolution models calculated with models of rotating stars better reproduce the early evolution of N/O, C/O and C12/C13. We calculated the weak s-process production induced by the primary neon 22 and obtain overproduction factors (relative to the initial composition, Z=1.e-6) between 100-1000 in the mass range 60-90. 
0808.03724	On The Origins Of Eccentric Close-in Planets	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Soko Matsumura, Genya Takeda, Fred Rasio	Abstract:  Strong tidal interaction with the central star can circularize the orbits of close-in planets. With the standard tidal quality factor Q of our solar system, estimated circularization times for close-in extrasolar planets are typically shorter than the ages of the host stars. While most extrasolar planets with orbital radii a < 0.1 AU indeed have circular orbits, some close-in planets with substantial orbital eccentricities have recently been discovered. This new class of eccentric close-in planets implies that either their tidal Q factor is considerably higher, or circularization is prevented by an external perturbation. Here we constrain the tidal Q factor for transiting extrasolar planets by comparing their circularization times with accurately determined stellar ages. Using estimated secular perturbation timescales, we also provide constraints on the properties of hypothetical second planets exterior to the known ones. 
0808.03725	New Positron Spectral Features from Supersymmetric Dark Matter - a Way to Explain the PAMELA Data?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Lars Bergstrom, Torsten Bringmann, Joakim Edsjo	Abstract:  The space-borne antimatter experiment PAMELA has recently reported a surprising rise in the positron to electron ratio at high energies. It has also recently been found that electromagnetic radiative corrections in some cases may boost the gamma-ray yield from supersymmetric dark matter annihilations in the galactic halo by up to three or four orders of magnitude, providing distinct spectral signatures for indirect dark matter searches to look for. Here, we investigate whether the same type of corrections can also lead to sizeable enhancements in the positron yield. We find that this is indeed the case, albeit for a smaller region of parameter space than for gamma rays; selecting models with a small mass difference between the neutralino and sleptons, like in the stau coannihilation region in mSUGRA, the effect becomes more pronounced. The resulting, rather hard positron spectrum with a relatively sharp cutoff may potentially fit the rising positron ratio measured by the PAMELA satellite. To do so, however, very large "boost factors" have to be invoked that are not expected in current models of halo structure. If the predicted cutoff would also be confirmed by later PAMELA data or upcoming experiments, one could either assume non-thermal production in the early universe or non-standard halo formation to explain such a spectral feature as an effect of dark matter annihilation. At the end of the paper, we briefly comment on the impact of radiative corrections on other annihilation channels, in particular antiprotons and neutrinos. 
0808.03726	Highly accurate recommendation algorithm based on high-order similarities	Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)	Authors:Jian-Guo Liu, Tao Zhou, Bing-Hong Wang, Yi-Cheng Zhang	Abstract:  In this Letter, we introduce a modified collaborative filtering (MCF) algorithm, which has remarkably higher accuracy than the standard collaborative filtering. In the MCF, instead of the standard Pearson coefficient, the user-user similarities are obtained by a diffusion process. Furthermore, by considering the second order similarities, we design an effective algorithm that depresses the influence of mainstream preferences. The corresponding algorithmic accuracy, measured by the ranking score, is further improved by 24.9% in the optimal case. In addition, two significant criteria of algorithmic performance, diversity and popularity, are also taken into account. Numerical results show that the algorithm based on second order similarity can outperform the MCF simultaneously in all three criteria. 
0808.03727	Thermal Flipping of Interstellar Grains	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Joseph C. Weingartner	Abstract:  In interstellar dust grains, internal processes dissipate rotational kinetic energy. The dissipation is accompanied by thermal fluctuations, which transfer energy from the vibrational modes to rotation. Together, these processes are known as internal relaxation. For the past several years, internal relaxation has been thought to give rise to thermal flipping, with profound consequences for grain alignment theory. I show that thermal flipping is not possible in the limit that the inertia tensor does not vary with time. 
0808.03728	Non-uniform sampling, image recovery from sparse data and the discrete sampling theorem	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Leonid P. Yaroslavsky, Gil Shabat, Benny G. Salomon, Ianir A. Ideses, Barak Fishbain	Abstract:  In many applications sampled data are collected in irregular fashion or are partly lost or unavailable. In these cases it is required to convert irregularly sampled signals to regularly sampled ones or to restore missing data. In this paper, we address this problem in a framework of a discrete sampling theorem for band-limited discrete signals that have a limited number of non-zero transform coefficients in a certain transform domain. Conditions for the image unique recovery, from sparse samples, are formulated and then analyzed for various transforms. Applications are demonstrated on examples of image super-resolution and image reconstruction from sparse projections. 
0808.03729	Gravitational time advancement and its possible detection	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:A. Bhadra, K. K. Nandi	Abstract:  The gravitational time advancement is a natural but a consequence of curve space-time geometry. In the present work the expressions of gravitational time advancement have been obtained for geodesic motions. The situation when the distance of signal travel is small in comparison to the distance of closest approach has also been considered. The possibility of experimental detection of time advancement effect has been explored. 
0808.03730	A hyperbolic Out(F_n)-complex	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Mladen Bestvina, Mark Feighn	Abstract:  For any finite collection $f_i$ of fully irreducible automorphisms of the free group $F_n$ we construct a connected $δ$-hyperbolic $Out(F_n)$-complex in which each $f_i$ has positive translation length. 
0808.03731	K1(1270)-K1(1400) Mixing Angle and New-Physics Effects in B to K1 l+ l- Decays	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Hisaki Hatanaka, Kwei-Chou Yang	Abstract:  We study semileptonic B meson decays B to K_1(1270) l^+ l^- and K_1(1400) l^+ l^- (l=e, mu, tau), where the strange P-wave mesons, K_1(1270) and K_1(1400), are the mixtures of the K_{1A} and K_{1B}, which are the 1^3P_1 and 1^1P_1 states, respectively. We show that the ratio R_l = Br(B to K_1(1400) l^+ l^-)/Br(B to K_1(1270) l^+ l^-), insensitive to new-physics parameters, is suitable for determining the K_1(1270)-K_1(1400) mixing angle, theta_{K_1}. The forward-backward asymmetry shows a weak theta_{K_1}-dependence for B to K_1(1270) mu^+ mu^-, but relatively strong for B to K_1(1400) mu^+ mu^-. We investigate model-independent new-physics corrections to operators relevant to the b to s l^+ l^- electroweak-penguin and weak-box diagrams. Furthermore, for the B to K_1(1270) mu^+ mu^- decay the position of the forward-backward asymmetry zero, which is almost independent of the value of theta_{K_1}, can be dramatically changed under variation of new-physics parameters. 
0808.03732	Survival of contact processes on the hierarchical group	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Siva R. Athreya, Jan M. Swart	Abstract:  We consider contact processes on the hierarchical group, where sites infect other sites at a rate depending on their hierarchical distance, and sites become healthy with a constant recovery rate. If the infection rates decay too fast as a function of the hierarchical distance, then we show that the critical recovery rate is zero. On the other hand, we derive sufficient conditions on the speed of decay of the infection rates for the process to exhibit a nontrivial phase transition between extinction and survival. For our sufficient conditions, we use a coupling argument that compares contact processes on the hierarchical group with freedom two with contact processes on a renormalized lattice. An interesting novelty in this renormalization argument is the use of a result due to Rogers and Pitman on Markov functionals. 
0808.03733	The abstract Titchmarsh-Weyl M-function for adjoint operator pairs and its relation to the spectrum	Spectral Theory (math.SP)	Authors:Malcolm Brown, James Hinchcliffe, Marco Marletta, Serguei Naboko, Ian Wood	Abstract:  In the setting of adjoint pairs of operators we consider the question: to what extent does the Weyl M-function see the same singularities as the resolvent of a certain restriction $A_B$ of the maximal operator? We obtain results showing that it is possible to describe explicitly certain spaces $\Sc$ and $\tilde{\Sc}$ such that the resolvent bordered by projections onto these subspaces is analytic everywhere that the M-function is analytic. We present three examples -- one involving a Hain-Lüst type operator, one involving a perturbed Friedrichs operator and one involving a simple ordinary differential operators on a half line -- which together indicate that the abstract results are probably best possible. 
0808.03734	Self-consistent study of Anderson localization in the Anderson-Hubbard model in two and three dimensions	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:Peter Henseler, Johann Kroha, Boris Shapiro	Abstract:  We consider the change in electron localization due to the presence of electron-electron repulsion in the \HA model. Taking into account local Mott-Hubbard physics and static screening of the disorder potential, the system is mapped onto an effective single-particle Anderson model, which is studied within the self-consistent theory of electron localization. We find rich nonmonotonic behavior of the localization length $ξ$ in two-dimensional systems, including an interaction-induced exponential enhancement of $ξ$ for small and intermediate disorders although $ξ$ remains finite. In three dimensions we identify for half filling a Mott-Hubbard-assisted Anderson localized phase existing between the metallic and the Mott-Hubbard-gapped phases. For small $U$ there is re-entrant behavior from the Anderson localized phase to the metallic phase. 
0808.03735	Topological Confinement and Superconductivity	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:K. A. Al-Hassanieh, C. D. Batista, P. Sengupta, A. E. Feiguin	Abstract:  We derive a Kondo Lattice model with a correlated conduction band from a two-band Hubbard Hamiltonian. This mapping allows us to describe the emergence of a robust pairing mechanism in a model that only contains repulsive interactions. The mechanism is due to topological confinement and results from the interplay between antiferromagnetism and delocalization. By using Density-Matrix-Renormalization-Group (DMRG), we demonstrate that this mechanism leads to dominant superconducting correlations in a 1D-system. 
0808.03736	Vacuum polarization by fermionic fields in higher dimensional cosmic string space-time	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:J. Spinelly, E. R. Bezerra de Mello	Abstract:  In this paper we investigate vacuum polarization effects associated with charged massive quantum fermionic fields in a six-dimensional cosmic string space-times considering the presence of a magnetic flux running along its core. We have shown that for specific values of the parameters which codify the presence of the cosmic string, and the fractional part of the ratio of the magnetic flux by the quantum one, a closed expression for the respective Green function is obtained. Adopting this result, we explicitly calculate the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensors, $<T^A_B>_{Ren}$, and analyse this result in some limitting cases. 
0808.03737	Asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of Schrödinger type operators with degenerate kinetic energy	Spectral Theory (math.SP)	Authors:Christian Hainzl, Robert Seiringer	Abstract:  We study the eigenvalues of Schrödinger type operators $T + λV$ and their asymptotic behavior in the small coupling limit $λ\to 0$, in the case where the symbol of the kinetic energy, $T(p)$, strongly degenerates on a non-trivial manifold of codimension one. 
0808.03738	Coherent control of magnetization precession in ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:E. Rozkotova, P. Nemec, N. Tesarova, P. Maly, V. Novak, K. Olejnik, M. Cukr, T. Jungwirth	Abstract:  We report single-color, time resolved magneto-optical measurements in ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As. We demonstrate coherent optical control of the magnetization precession by applying two successive ultrashort laser pulses. The magnetic field and temperature dependent experiments reveal the collective Mn-moment nature of the oscillatory part of the time-dependent Kerr rotation, as well as contributions to the magneto-optical signal that are not connected with the magnetization dynamics. 
0808.03739	Leptogenesis in the E$_6$SSM: Flavour Dependent Lepton Asymmetries	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:S. F. King, R. Luo, D. J. Miller, R. Nevzorov	Abstract:  We discuss flavour dependent lepton asymmetries in the Exceptional Supersymmetric Standard Model (E$_6$SSM). In the E$_6$SSM, the right-handed neutrinos do not participate in gauge interactions, and they decay into leptons and leptoquarks. Their Majorana nature allows violation of lepton number. New particles and interactions can result in substantial lepton asymmetries, even for scales as low as $10^6 {\rm GeV}$. 
0808.03740	The Lie Algebra of Local Killing Fields	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Richard Atkins	Abstract:  We present an algebraic procedure that finds the Lie algebra of the local Killing fields of a smooth metric. In particular, we determine the number of independent local Killing fields about a given point on the manifold. Spaces of constant curvature and locally symmetric spaces are also discussed. Furthermore, we obtain a complete classification of the Lie algebra of local Killing fields for surfaces in terms of conditions upon the Gauss curvature. 
0808.03741	Geometric Approach to the Weil-Petersson Symplectic Form	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Reynir Axelsson, Georg Schumacher	Abstract:  In a family of compact, canonically polarized, complex manifolds the first variation of the lengths of closed geodesics is computed. As an application, we show the coincidence of the Fenchel-Nielsen and Weil-Petersson symplectic forms on the Teichmueller spaces of compact Riemann surfaces in a purely geometric way. The method can also be applied to situations like moduli spaces of weighted punctured Riemann surfaces, where the methods of Kleinian groups are not available. 
0808.03742	Valley density-wave and multiband superconductivity in Fe-pnictides	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Vladimir Cvetkovic, Zlatko Tesanovic	Abstract:  The key feature of the Fe-based superconductors is their quasi 2D multiband Fermi surface. By relating the problem to a negative U Hubbard model and its superconducting ground state, we show that the defining instability of such a Fermi surface is the valley density-wave (VDW), a combined spin/charge density-wave at the wavevector connecting the electron and hole valleys. As the valley parameters change by doping or pressure, the fictitious superconductor experiences "Zeeman splitting", eventually going into a non-uniform "Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinikov" (FFLO) state, an itinerant and often incommensurate VDW of the real world, characterized by the metallic conductivity from the ungapped remnants of the Fermi surface. When "Zeeman splitting" exceeds the "Chandrasekhar-Clogston" limit, the "FFLO" state disappears, and the VDW is destabilized. Near this point, the VDW fluctuations and interband pair repulsion are essential ingredients of high-Tc superconductivity in Fe-pnictides. 
0808.03743	Some questions about $\mathcal G$-bundles on curves	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:G. Pappas, M. Rapoport	Abstract:  We define the notion of a parahoric group scheme $\mathcal G$ over a smooth projective curve, and formulate four conjectures on the structure of the stack of $\mathcal G$-bundles, which generalize to this case well-known results on $G$-bundles with $G$ a constant reductive group. The conjectures concern the set of connected components, the uniformization by affine flag varieties of twisted loop groups, the Picard groups, and the space of global sections of a dominant line bundle. Since a first version of this paper was circulated, Heinloth [arXiv:0711.4450] has proved a good part of these conjectures. 
0808.03744	High-(Energy)-Lights -- The Very High Energy Gamma-Ray Sky	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:D. Horns (University of Hamburg, Institute for Experimental Physics, Hamburg)    	Abstract:  The high-lights of ground-based very-high-energy (VHE, $E>100$ GeV) gamma-ray astronomy are reviewed. The summary covers both Galactic and extra-galactic sources. A total of at least 70 sources are currently known. Implications for our understanding of the non-thermal Universe are discussed. The next generation of ground based gamma-ray instruments aims to cover the entire accessible energy range from as low as $\approx 10$ GeV up to $10^5$ GeV and to improve the sensitivity by an order of magnitude in comparison with current instruments. 
0808.03745	Noncommutative Q-Lumps	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Seckin Kurkcuoglu	Abstract:  Q-lumps associated with the noncommutative CP^N model in 2+1 dimensions are constructed. These are solitonic configurations which are time dependent and rotate with constant angular frequency. Energy of the Q-lumps is E=2 πk + α|Q|, and we find that in a regime in which the noncommutativity parameter θis related to the moduli determining the size of the lumps, it can be viewed to depend on θvia the Noether charge Q. We present a collective coordinate-type analysis signalling that CP^1 Q-lumps remain stable under small radiative perturbations. 
0808.03746	A game-theoretic version of Oakes' example for randomized forecasting	Machine Learning (cs.LG)	Authors:Vladimir V. V'yugin	Abstract:  Using the game-theoretic framework for probability, Vovk and Shafer. have shown that it is always possible, using randomization, to make sequential probability forecasts that pass any countable set of well-behaved statistical tests. This result generalizes work by other authors, who consider only tests of calbration. We complement this result with a lower bound. We show that Vovk and Shafer's result is valid only when the forecasts are computed with unrestrictedly increasing degree of accuracy. When some level of discreteness is fixed, we present a game-theoretic generalization of Oakes' example for randomized forecasting that is a test failing any given method of deferministic forecasting; originally, this example was presented for deterministic calibration. 
0808.03747	Forward Correction and Fountain codes in Delay Tolerant Networks	Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)	Authors:Eitan Altman, Francesco De Pellegrini	Abstract:  Delay tolerant Ad-hoc Networks make use of mobility of relay nodes to compensate for lack of permanent connectivity and thus enable communication between nodes that are out of range of each other. To decrease delivery delay, the information that needs to be delivered is replicated in the network. Our objective in this paper is to study replication mechanisms that include coding in order to improve the probability of successful delivery within a given time limit. We propose an analytical approach that allows to quantify tradeoffs between resources and performance measures (energy and delay). We study the effect of coding on the performance of the network while optimizing parameters that govern routing. Our results, based on fluid approximations, are compared to simulations which validate the model 
0808.03748	Charge dynamics in the normal state of the iron oxypnictide superconductor LaFePO	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:M. M. Qazilbash, J. J. Hamlin, R. E. Baumbach, M. B. Maple, D. N. Basov	Abstract:  We present the first infrared and optical study in the normal state of ab-plane oriented single crystals of the iron-oxypnictide superconductor LaFePO. We find that this material is a low carrier density metal with a moderate level of correlations and exhibits signatures of electron-boson coupling. The data is consistent with the presence of coherent quasiparticles in LaFePO. 
0808.03749	A supersymmetric version of the quark model, and supersymmetry breaking for the Leptons, Baryons and Hadronic Mesons: Cybersusy V	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:John Dixon	Abstract:  Cybersusy is a new mechanism for supersymmetry breaking in the standard supersymmetric model (SSM). Here we note that the superpotential for the SSM has a set of thirteen invariances, five of which are well known, and eight of which are new. The eight new invariances generate a sort of supersymmetric quark and lepton model, together with supersymmetry breaking that makes the squarks and sleptons very heavy. This breaking regenerates the standard model out of the supersymmetric standard model, except that the gauge particles are not yet included in this reduction. In this paper, it is shown that, with some continued effort, cybersusy will make some predictions for hadron masses that may actually be wrong, so that it is a supersymmetry breaking theory that can be proved wrong! This is the fifth paper in what was intended to be a series of four papers on cybersusy. 
0808.03750	The emergence of coherent magnetic excitations in the pseudogap phase of La2-xSrxCuO4	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:O.J. Lipscombe, B. Vignolle, T.G. Perring, C. D. Frost, S.M. Hayden	Abstract:  We use inelastic neutron scattering to measure the magnetic excitations in the underdoped superconductor La2-xSrxCuO4 (x=0.085, Tc=22 K) over energy and temperatures ranges 5 < E < 200 meV and 5 < T < 300 K respectively. At high temperature (T = 300 K), we observe strongly damped excitations with a characteristic energy scale of approximately 50 meV. As the temperature is lowered to T = 30 K, and we move into the pseudogap state, the magnetic excitations become highly structured in energy and momentum below about 60 meV. This change appears to be associated with the development of the pseudogap in the electronic excitations. 
0808.03751	Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the q-optimal measure	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Sotirios Sabanis	Abstract:  This paper presents the general form and essential properties of the q-optimal measure following the approach of Delbaen and Schachermayer (1996) and proves its existence under mild conditions. Most importantly, it states a necessary and sufficient condition for a candidate measure to be the q-optimal measure in the case even of signed measures. Finally, an updated characterization of the q-optimal measure for continuous asset price processes is presented in the light of the counterexample appearing in Cerny and Kallsen (2006) concerning Hobson's (2004) approach. 
0808.03752	QCD Sum Rules and 1/$N_c$ expansion	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Toru Kojo, Daisuke Jido	Abstract:  The 1/$N_c$ arguments are developed to classify the hadronic states in the correlators. Arguments applied to the $σ$ meson correlator enable to separate the instanton, glueball, and, in particular, the $ππ$ scattering states by $1/N_c$ from both 2q and 4q correlators. The bare resonance pole with no mixing effects are analyzed with the QCD sum rules (QSR). The results suggest the existence of nontrivial correlation for the mass reduction of 4q system. 
0808.03753	Hilbert-Chow morphism for non commutative Hilbert schemes and moduli spaces of linear representations	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Federica Galluzzi, Francesco Vaccarino	Abstract:  Let $k$ be a commutative ring and let $R$ be a commutative $k-$algebra. The aim of this paper is to define and discuss some connection morphisms between schemes associated to the representation theory of a (non necessarily commutative) $R-$algebra $A. $ We focus on the scheme $\ran//\GL_n$ of the $n-$dimensional representations of $A, $ on the Hilbert scheme $\Hilb_A^n$ parameterizing the left ideals of codimension $n$ of $A$ and on the affine scheme Spec $Γ_R^n(A)^{ab} $ of the abelianization of the divided powers of order $n$ over $A. $ We give a generalization of the Grothendieck-Deligne norm map from $\Hilb_A^n$ to Spec $Γ_R^n(A)^{ab} $ which specializes to the Hilbert Chow morphism on the geometric points when $A$ is commutative and $k$ is an algebraically closed field. Describing the Hilbert scheme as the base of a principal bundle we shall factor this map through the moduli space $\ran//\GL_n$ giving a nice description of this Hilbert-Chow morphism, and consequently proving that it is projective. 
0808.03754	Thermal Casimir effect in ideal metal rectangular boxes	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:B. Geyer, G. L. Klimchitskaya, V. M. Mostepanenko	Abstract:  The thermal Casimir effect in ideal metal rectangular boxes is considered using the method of zeta functional regularization. The renormalization procedure is suggested which provides the finite expression for the Casimir free energy in any restricted quantization volume. This expression satisfies the classical limit at high temperature and leads to zero thermal Casimir force for systems with infinite characteristic dimensions. In the case of two parallel ideal metal planes the results, as derived previously using thermal quantum field theory in Matsubara formulation and other methods, are reproduced starting from the obtained expression. It is shown that for rectangular boxes the temperature-dependent contribution to the electromagnetic Casimir force can be both positive and negative depending on side lengths. The numerical computations of the scalar and electromagnetic Casimir free energy and force are performed for cubes 
0808.03755	Occupation times of subcritical branching immigration system with Markov motions	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Piotr Milos	Abstract:  We consider a branching system consisting of particles moving according to a Markov family in $\Rd$ and undergoing subcritical branching with a constant rate $V>0$. New particles immigrate to the system according to homogeneous space-time Poisson random field. The process of the fluctuations of the rescaled occupation time is studied with very mild assumptions on the Markov family. In this general setting a functional central limit theorem is proved. The subcriticality of the branching law is crucial for the limit behaviour and in a sense overwhelms the properties of the particles' motion. It is for this reason that the limit is the same for all dimensions and can be obtained for a wide class of Markov processes. Another consequence is the form of the limit - $\SP$-valued Wiener process with a simple temporal structure and a complicated spatial one. This behaviour contrasts sharply with the case of critical branching systems. 
0808.03756	Approaching Blokh-Zyablov Error Exponent with Linear-Time Encodable/Decodable Codes	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Zheng Wang, Jie Luo	Abstract:  Guruswami and Indyk showed in [1] that Forney's error exponent can be achieved with linear coding complexity over binary symmetric channels. This paper extends this conclusion to general discrete-time memoryless channels and shows that Forney's and Blokh-Zyablov error exponents can be arbitrarily approached by one-level and multi-level concatenated codes with linear encoding/decoding complexity. The key result is a revision to Forney's general minimum distance decoding algorithm, which enables a low complexity integration of Guruswami-Indyk's outer codes into the concatenated coding schemes. 
0808.03757	Differentiable potentials and metallic states in disordered one-dimensional systems	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:Antonio M. Garcia-Garcia, Emilio Cuevas	Abstract:  We provide evidence that as a general rule Anderson localization effects become weaker as the degree of differentiability of the disordered potential increases. In one dimension a band of metallic states exists provided that the disordered potential is sufficiently correlated and has some minimum degree of differentiability. Several examples are studied in detail. In agreement with the one parameter scaling theory the motion in the metallic region is ballistic if the spectral density is smooth. Finally, we study the most promising settings to observe these results in the context of cold atoms. 
0808.03758	Parameters of Pseudo-Random Quantum Circuits	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Yaakov S. Weinstein, Winton G. Brown, Lorenza Viola	Abstract:  Pseudorandom circuits generate quantum states and unitary operators which are approximately distributed according to the unitarily invariant Haar measure. We explore how several design parameters affect the efficiency of pseudo-random circuits, with the goal of identifying relevant trade-offs and optimizing convergence. The parameters we explore include the choice of single- and two-qubit gates, the topology of the underlying physical qubit architecture, the probabilistic application of two-qubit gates, as well as circuit size, initialization, and the effect of control constraints. Building on the equivalence between pseudo-random circuits and approximate $t$-designs, a Markov matrix approach is employed to analyze asymptotic convergence properties of pseudo-random second-order moments to a 2-design. Quantitative results on the convergence rate as a function of the circuit size are presented for qubit topologies with a sufficient degree of symmetry. Our results may be theoretically and practically useful to optimize the efficiency of random state and operator generation. 
0808.03759	Spontaneous free-boundary structure in crumpled membranes	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:T. A. Witten	Abstract:  We investigate the strong curvature that appears at the boundaries of a thin crumpled elastic membrane. We account for these high-curvature regions in terms of the stretching-ridge singularity believed to dominate the structure of strongly deformed elastic membranes. Using a membrane fastened to itself to form a bag shape with a single stretching ridge, we show that the creation of points of high boundary curvature lowers the interior ridge's energy. In the limit of small thickness, the induced curvature becomes arbitrarily strong on the scale of the object size and results in sharp edges connecting interior vertices to the boundary. REVISED: We analyze these edges as conical sectors with no stretching. As the membrane size diverges, the edge energy grows as the square root of the central ridge energy. For comparison, we discuss the effect of truncating a stretching ridge at its ends. The effect of truncation becomes appreciable when the truncation length is comparable to the width of the untruncated ridge. 
0808.03760	Hypergraph Ramsey numbers	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:David Conlon, Jacob Fox, Benny Sudakov	Abstract:  The Ramsey number r_k(s,n) is the minimum N such that every red-blue coloring of the k-tuples of an N-element set contains either a red set of size s or a blue set of size n, where a set is called red (blue) if all k-tuples from this set are red (blue). In this paper we obtain new estimates for several basic hypergraph Ramsey problems. We give a new upper bound for r_k(s,n) for k \geq 3 and s fixed. In particular, we show that r_3(s,n) \leq 2^{n^{s-2}\log n}, which improves by a factor of n^{s-2}/ polylog n the exponent of the previous upper bound of Erdos and Rado from 1952. We also obtain a new lower bound for these numbers, showing that there are constants c_1,c_2>0 such that r_3(s,n) \geq 2^{c_1 sn \log (n/s)} for all 4 \leq s \leq c_2n. When s is a constant, it gives the first superexponential lower bound for r_3(s,n), answering an open question posed by Erdos and Hajnal in 1972. Next, we consider the 3-color Ramsey number r_3(n,n,n), which is the minimum N such that every 3-coloring of the triples of an N-element set contains a monochromatic set of size n. Improving another old result of Erdos and Hajnal, we show that r_3(n,n,n) \geq 2^{n^{c \log n}}. Finally, we make some progress on related hypergraph Ramsey-type problems. 
0808.03761	Flavor symmetry for strong phases and determination of $β_s, ΔΓ$ in $B_s \to J/ψφ$	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Michael Gronau, Jonathan L. Rosner	Abstract:  Studies of angular and time distributions and CP-violating observables in $B_s\to J/ψφ$ decays yield a space of parameters which can be considerably reduced if relative strong phases among different amplitudes are specified. We show that the relations between $B_s \to J/ψφ$ and $B^0 \to J/ψK^{*0}$ amplitudes given by flavor symmetry [actually U(3) rather than SU(3)] are likely to be quite reliable, and hence the use of strong phases from $B^0 \to J/ψK^{*0}$ in the analysis of $B_s \to J/ψφ$ is justified. We point out the potential advantage of using helicity angles over transversity angles, and comment on a way to measure a sizable CP-violating phase independent of strong phases. 
0808.03762	The isocohomological property, higher Dehn functions, and relatively hyperbolic groups	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:R. Ji, B. Ramsey	Abstract:  The property that the polynomial cohomology with coefficients of a finitely generated discrete group is canonically isomorphic to the group cohomology is called the (weak) isocohomological property for the group. In the case when a group is of type $HF^\infty$, i.e. that has a classifying space with the homotopy type of a cellular complex with finitely many cells in each dimension, we show that the isocohomological property is equivalent to the universal cover of the classifying space satisfying polynomially bounded higher Dehn functions. If a group is hyperbolic relative to a collection of subgroups, each of which is polynomially combable (respectively $HF^\infty$ and isocohomological), then we show that the group itself has these respective properties too. Combining with the results of Connes-Moscovici and Dru{ţ}u-Sapir we conclude that a group satisfies the Novikov conjecture if it is relatively hyperbolic to subgroups that are of property RD, of type $HF^\infty$ and isocohomological. 
0808.03763	The commutant of L(H) in its ultrapower may or may not be trivial	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Ilijas Farah, N. Christopher Phillips, Juris Steprāns	Abstract:  Kirchberg asked in 2004 whether the commutant of L(H)$ in its (norm) ultrapower is trivial. Assuming the Continnuum Hypothesis, we prove that the answer depends on the choice of the ultrafilter. 
0808.03764	Strong and Electromagnetic Decays of X(1835) as a Baryonium State	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Yong-Liang Ma	Abstract:  With the assumption that the recently observed X(1835) is a baryonium state we have studied the strong decays of $X(1835) \to η^{(\prime)} π^+ π^-, η^{(\prime)} π^0 π^0$ and the electromagnetic decay of $X(1835) \to 2γ$ in the framework of effective Lagrangian formalism. In the present investigation we have included the contributions from the iso-singlet light scalar resonances but we have not included the isospin violating effect. Our result for the strong decay of $X(1835) \to η^{\prime} π^+ π^-$ is smaller than the observed data. The decay width for the radiative decay of $X(1835) \to 2γ$ is consistent with the assumption that it decays through the glueball. In addition, the width for the strong decay of $X(1835) \to η π^+ π^-$ is larger than that of the strong decay of $X(1835) \to η^{\prime} π^+ π^-$ due to the large phase space and coupling constant $g_{N\bar{N}η}$. From our investigation, it is not possible to interpret X(1835) as a baryonium. 
0808.03765	Could deformed special relativity naturally arise from the semiclassical limit of quantum gravity?	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Lee Smolin	Abstract:  A argument is described for how deformed or doubly special relativity may arise in the semiclassical limit of a quantum theory of gravity. We consider a generic quantum theory of gravity coupled to matter, from which we use only the assumption that a Hamiltonian constraint is imposed. We study circumstances in which Lambda, G and hbar all may be separately neglected, but there may arise terms in the ratio of particle energies to the Planck mass which are small but measurable. Such cases include probes of an energy dependent speed of light such as are possible in experiments such as MAGIC and GLAST. We show that in such cases the leading order effect of quantum gravity will, if certain scaling relations are satisfied, be to deform the metric in the effective Hamiltonian of the matter quantum field theory by terms linear in energies. As the Hamiltonian constraint has been imposed there can be no preferred time coordinate or frame of reference, hence this is a modification rather than a breaking of special relativity. 
0808.03766	Using Spatial Distributions to Constrain Progenitors of Supernovae and Gamma Ray Bursts	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Cody Raskin, Evan Scannapieco, James Rhoads, Massimo Della Valle	Abstract:  We carry out a comprehensive theoretical examination of the relationship between the spatial distribution of optical transients and the properties of their progenitor stars. By constructing analytic models of star-forming galaxies and the evolution of stellar populations within them, we are able to place constraints on candidate progenitors for core-collapse supernovae (SNe), long-duration gamma ray bursts, and supernovae Ia. In particular we first construct models of spiral galaxies that reproduce observations of core-collapse SNe, and we use these models to constrain the minimum mass for SNe Ic progenitors to approximately 25 solar masses. Secondly, we lay out the parameters of a dwarf irregular galaxy model, which we use to show that the progenitors of long-duration gamma-ray bursts are likely to have masses above approximately 43 solar masses. Finally, we introduce a new method for constraining the time scale associated with SNe Ia and apply it to our spiral galaxy models to show how observations can better be analyzed to discriminate between the leading progenitor models for these objects. 
0808.03767	No large-angle correlations on the non-Galactic microwave sky	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Craig J. Copi, Dragan Huterer, Dominik J. Schwarz, Glenn D. Starkman	Abstract:  We investigate the angular two-point correlation function of temperature in the WMAP maps. Updating and extending earlier results, we confirm the lack of correlations outside the Galaxy on angular scales greater than about 60 degrees at a level that would occur in 0.025 per cent of realizations of the concordance model. This represents a dramatic increase in significance from the original observations by the COBE-DMR and a marked increase in significance from the first-year WMAP maps. Given the rest of the reported angular power spectrum C_\ell, the lack of large-angle correlations that one infers outside the plane of the Galaxy requires covariance among the C_\ell up to \ell=5. Alternately, it requires both the unusually small (5 per cent of realizations) full-sky large-angle correlations, and an unusual coincidence of alignment of the Galaxy with the pattern of cosmological fluctuations (less than 2 per cent of those 5 per cent). We argue that unless there is some undiscovered systematic error in their collection or reduction, the data point towards a violation of statistical isotropy. The near-vanishing of the large-angle correlations in the cut-sky maps, together with their disagreement with results inferred from full-sky maps, remain open problems, and are very difficult to understand within the concordance model. 
0808.03768	Toric Calabi-Yau four-folds dual to Chern-Simons-matter theories	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Kazushi Ueda, Masahito Yamazaki	Abstract:  We propose a new method to find gravity duals to a large class of three-dimensional Chern-Simons-matter theories, using techniques from dimer models. The gravity dual is given by M-theory on AdS_4\times Y_7, where Y_7 is an arbitrary seven-dimensional toric Sasaki-Einstein manifold. The cone of Y_7 is a toric Calabi-Yau 4-fold, which coincides with a branch of the vacuum moduli space of Chern-Simons-matter theories. 
0808.03769	Effect of Helium Sedimentation on X-ray Measurements of Galaxy Clusters	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Fang Peng, Daisuke Nagai	Abstract:  The uniformity of the helium-to-hydrogen abundance ratio in X-ray emitting intracluster medium (ICM) is one of the commonly adopted assumptions in X-ray analyses of galaxy clusters and cosmological constraints derived from these measurements. In this work, we investigate the effect of He sedimentation on X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters in order to assess this assumption and associated systematic uncertainties. By solving a set of flow equations for a H-He plasma, we show that the helium-to-hydrogen mass ratio is significantly enhanced in the inner regions of clusters. The effect of He sedimentation, if not accounted for, introduces systematic biases in observable properties of clusters derived using X-ray observations. We show that these biases also introduce an apparent evolution in the observed gas mass fractions of X-ray luminous, dynamically relaxed clusters and hence biases in observational constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter, w, derived from the cluster distance-redshift relation. The Hubble parameter derived from the combination of X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) measurements is affected by the He sedimentation process as well. Future measurements aiming to constrain w or H_0 to better than 10% may need to take into account the effect of He sedimentation. We propose that the evolution of gas mass fraction in the inner regions of clusters should provide unique observational diagnostics of the He sedimentation process. 
0808.03770	Properties of the scale factor measure	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Raphael Bousso, Ben Freivogel, I-Sheng Yang	Abstract:  We show that in expanding regions, the scale factor measure can be reformulated as a local measure: Observations are weighted by integrating their physical density along a geodesic that starts in the longest-lived metastable vacuum. This explains why some of its properties are similar to those of the causal diamond measure. In particular, both measures are free of Boltzmann brains, subject to nearly the same conditions on vacuum stability. However, the scale factor measure assigns a much smaller probability to the observed value of the cosmological constant. The probability decreases further, like the inverse sixth power of the primordial density contrast, if the latter is allowed to vary. 
0808.03771	Chandra X-ray spectroscopy of the focused wind in the Cygnus X-1 system. I. The non-dip spectrum in the low/hard state	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Manfred Hanke, Joern Wilms, Michael A. Nowak, Katja Pottschmidt, Norbert S. Schulz, Julia C. Lee	Abstract:  We present analyses of a 50 ks observation of the supergiant X-ray binary system Cygnus X-1/HDE 226868 taken with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS). Cyg X-1 was in its spectrally hard state and the observation was performed during superior conjunction of the black hole, allowing for the spectroscopic analysis of the accreted stellar wind along the line of sight. A significant part of the observation covers X-ray dips as commonly observed for Cyg X-1 at this orbital phase, however, here we only analyze the high count rate non-dip spectrum. The full 0.5-10 keV continuum can be described by a single model consisting of a disk, a narrow and a relativistically broadened Fe Kalpha line, and a power law component, which is consistent with simultaneous RXTE broad band data. We detect absorption edges from overabundant neutral O, Ne and Fe, and absorption line series from highly ionized ions and infer column densities and Doppler shifts. With emission lines of He-like Mg XI, we detect two plasma components with velocities and densities consistent with the base of the spherical wind and a focused wind. A simple simulation of the photoionization zone suggests that large parts of the spherical wind outside of the focused stream are completely ionized, which is consistent with the low velocities (<200 km/s) observed in the absorption lines, as the position of absorbers in a spherical wind at low projected velocity is well constrained. Our observations provide input for models that couple the wind activity of HDE 226868 to the properties of the accretion flow onto the black hole. 
0808.03772	A common mass scale for satellite galaxies of the Milky Way	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Louis E. Strigari, James S. Bullock, Manoj Kaplinghat, Joshua D. Simon, Marla Geha, Beth Willman, Matthew G. Walker	Abstract:  The Milky Way has at least twenty-three known satellite galaxies that shine with luminosities ranging from about a thousand to a billion times that of the Sun. Half of these galaxies were discovered in the past few years in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and they are among the least luminous galaxies in the known Universe. A determination of the mass of these galaxies provides a test of galaxy formation at the smallest scales and probes the nature of the dark matter that dominates the mass density of the Universe. Here we use new measurements of the velocities of the stars in these galaxies to show that they are consistent with them having a common mass of about 10^7 M_\odot within their central 300 parsecs. This result demonstrates that the faintest of the Milky Way satellites are the most dark matter-dominated galaxies known, and could be a hint of a new scale in galaxy formation or a characteristic scale for the clustering of dark matter. 
0808.03773	Area laws for the entanglement entropy - a review	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:J. Eisert, M. Cramer, M.B. Plenio	Abstract:  Physical interactions in quantum many-body systems are typically local: Individual constituents interact mainly with their few nearest neighbors. This locality of interactions is inherited by a decay of correlation functions, but also reflected by scaling laws of a quite profound quantity: The entanglement entropy of ground states. This entropy of the reduced state of a subregion often merely grows like the boundary area of the subregion, and not like its volume, in sharp contrast with an expected extensive behavior. Such "area laws" for the entanglement entropy and related quantities have received considerable attention in recent years. They emerge in several seemingly unrelated fields, in the context of black hole physics, quantum information science, and quantum many-body physics where they have important implications on the numerical simulation of lattice models. In this Colloquium we review the current status of area laws in these fields. Center stage is taken by rigorous results on lattice models in one and higher spatial dimensions. The differences and similarities between bosonic and fermionic models are stressed, area laws are related to the velocity of information propagation, and disordered systems, non-equilibrium situations, classical correlation concepts, and topological entanglement entropies are discussed. A significant proportion of the article is devoted to the quantitative connection between the entanglement content of states and the possibility of their efficient numerical simulation. We discuss matrix-product states, higher-dimensional analogues, and states from entanglement renormalization and conclude by highlighting the implications of area laws on quantifying the effective degrees of freedom that need to be considered in simulations. 
0808.03774	Formation of a Quasar Host Galaxy through a Wet Merger 1.4 Billion Years after the Big Bang	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Dominik A. Riechers (1,2,5), Fabian Walter (1), Christopher L. Carilli (3), Frank Bertoldi (4), Emmanuel Momjian (3) ((1) MPIA, Germany; (2) Caltech, USA; (3) NRAO, USA; (4) AIfA Bonn, Germany; (5) Hubble Fellow)    	Abstract:  We present high-resolution Very Large Array imaging of the molecular gas in the host galaxy of the high redshift quasar BRI 1335-0417 (z=4.41). Our CO(2-1) observations have a linear resolution of 0.15" (1.0 kpc) and resolve the molecular gas emission both spatially and in velocity. The molecular gas in BRI 1335-0417 is extended on scales of 5 kpc, and shows a complex structure. At least three distinct components encompassing about two thirds of the total molecular mass of 9.2 x 10^10 M_sun are identified in velocity space, which are embedded in a structure that harbors about one third of the total molecular mass in the system. The brightest CO(2-1) line emission region has a peak brightness temperature of 61+/-9 K within 1 kpc diameter, which is comparable to the kinetic gas temperature as predicted from the CO line excitation. This is also comparable to the gas temperatures found in the central regions of nearby ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, which are however much more compact than 1 kpc. The spatial and velocity structure of the molecular reservoir in BRI 1335-0417 is inconsistent with a simple gravitationally bound disk, but resembles a merging system. Our observations are consistent with a major, gas-rich (`wet') merger that both feeds an accreting supermassive black hole (causing the bright quasar activity), and fuels a massive starburst that builds up the stellar bulge in this galaxy. Our study of this z>4 quasar host galaxy may thus be the most direct observational evidence that `wet' mergers at high redshift are related to AGN activity. 
0808.03775	Observational evidence of CMEs interacting in the inner heliosphere as inferred from MHD simulations	Space Physics (physics.space-ph)	Authors:N. Lugaz, W. B. Manchester IV, I. I. Roussev, T. I. Gombosi	Abstract:  The interaction of multiple Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) has been observed by LASCO coronagraphs and by near-Earth spacecraft, and it is thought to be an important cause of geo-effective storms, large Solar Energetic Particles events and intense Type II radio bursts. New and future missions such as STEREO, the LWS Sentinels, and the Solar Orbiter will provide additional observations of the interaction of multiple CMEs between the Sun and the Earth. We present the results of simulations of two and more CMEs interacting in the inner heliosphere performed with the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF). Based on those simulations, we discuss the observational evidence of the interaction of multiple CMEs, both in situ and from coronagraphs. The clearest evidence of the interaction of the CMEs are the large temperature in the sheath, due to the shocks merging, and the brightness increase in coronagraphic images, associated with the interaction of the leading edges. The importance of having multiple satellites at different distances and angular positions from the Sun is also discussed. 
0808.03776	Relativistic Lee Model on Riemannian Manifolds	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Burak Tevfik Kaynak, Osman Teoman Turgut	Abstract:  We study the relativistic Lee model on static Riemannian manifolds. The model is constructed nonperturbatively through its resolvent, which is based on the so-called principal operator and the heat kernel techniques. It is shown that making the principal operator well-defined dictates how to renormalize the parameters of the model. The renormalization of the parameters are the same in the light front coordinates as in the instant form. Moreover, the renormalization of the model on Riemannian manifolds agrees with the flat case. The asymptotic behavior of the renormalized principal operator in the large number of bosons limit implies that the ground state energy is positive. In 2+1 dimensions, the model requires only a mass renormalization. We obtain rigorous bounds on the ground state energy for the n-particle sector of 2+1 dimensional model. 
0808.03777	Toward precise constraints on growth of massive black holes	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Qingjuan Yu, Youjun Lu	Abstract:  Growth of massive black holes (MBHs) in galactic centers comes mainly from gas accretion during their QSO/AGN phases. In this paper we apply an extended Soltan argument, connecting the local MBH mass function with the time-integral of the QSO luminosity function, to the demography of MBHs and QSOs from recent optical and X-ray surveys, and obtain robust constraints on the luminosity evolution (or mass growth history) of individual QSOs (or MBHs). We find that the luminosity evolution probably involves two phases: an initial exponentially increasing phase set by the Eddington limit and a following phase in which the luminosity declines with time as a power law (with a slope of -1.2--1.3) set by a self-similar long-term evolution of disk accretion. Neither an evolution involving only the increasing phase with a single Eddington ratio nor an exponentially declining pattern in the second phase is likely. The period of a QSO radiating at a luminosity higher than 10% of its peak value is about (2-3)x10^8 yr, during which the MBH obtains ~80% of its mass. The mass-to-energy conversion efficiency is $0.16\pm0.04 ^{+0.05}_{-0}$, with the latter error accounting for the maximum uncertainty due to Compton-thick AGNs. The expected Eddington ratios in QSOs from the constrained luminosity evolution cluster around a single value close to 0.5-1 for high-luminosity QSOs and extend to a wide range of lower values for low-luminosity ones. The Eddington ratios for high luminosity QSOs appear to conflict with those estimated from observations (~0.25) by using some virial mass estimators for MBHs in QSOs unless the estimators systematically over-estimate MBH masses by a factor of 2-4. We also infer the fraction of optically obscured QSOs ~60-80%. Further applications of the luminosity evolution of individual QSOs are also discussed. 
0808.03778	Boltzmann brains and the scale-factor cutoff measure of the multiverse	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Andrea De Simone, Alan H. Guth, Andrei Linde, Mahdiyar Noorbala, Michael P. Salem, Alexander Vilenkin	Abstract:  To make predictions for an eternally inflating "multiverse", one must adopt a procedure for regulating its divergent spacetime volume. Recently, a new test of such spacetime measures has emerged: normal observers - who evolve in pocket universes cooling from hot big bang conditions - must not be vastly outnumbered by "Boltzmann brains" - freak observers that pop in and out of existence as a result of rare quantum fluctuations. If the Boltzmann brains prevail, then a randomly chosen observer would be overwhelmingly likely to be surrounded by an empty world, where all but vacuum energy has redshifted away, rather than the rich structure that we observe. Using the scale-factor cutoff measure, we calculate the ratio of Boltzmann brains to normal observers. We find the ratio to be finite, and give an expression for it in terms of Boltzmann brain nucleation rates and vacuum decay rates. We discuss the conditions that these rates must obey for the ratio to be acceptable, and we discuss estimates of the rates under a variety of assumptions. 
0808.03779	Probing local relaxation of cold atoms in optical superlattices	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:A. Flesch, M. Cramer, I.P. McCulloch, U. Schollwoeck, J. Eisert	Abstract:  In the study of relaxation processes in coherent non-equilibrium dynamics of quenched quantum systems, ultracold atoms in optical superlattices with periodicity two provide a very fruitful test ground. In this work, we consider the dynamics of a particular, experimentally accessible initial state prepared in a superlattice structure evolving under a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian in the entire range of interaction strengths, further investigating the issues raised in Ref. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 063001 (2008)]. We investigate the relaxation dynamics analytically in the non interacting and hard core bosonic limits, deriving explicit expressions for the dynamics of certain correlation functions, and numerically for finite interaction strengths using the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization (t-DMRG) approach. We can identify signatures of local relaxation that can be accessed experimentally with present technology. While the global system preserves the information about the initial condition, locally the system relaxes to the state having maximum entropy respecting the constraints of the initial condition. For finite interaction strengths and finite times, the relaxation dynamics contains signatures of the relaxation dynamics of both the non-interacting and hard core bosonic limits. 
0808.03780	Creating Artificial Ice States Using Vortices in Nanostructured Superconductors	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:A. Libal, C.J. Olson Reichhardt, C. Reichhardt	Abstract:  We demonstrate that it is possible to realize vortex ice states that are analogous to square and kagome ice. With numerical simulations, we show that the system can be brought into a state that obeys either global or local ice rules by applying an external current according to an annealing protocol. We explore the breakdown of the ice rules due to disorder in the nanostructure array and show that in square ice, topological defects appear along grain boundaries, while in kagome ice, individual defects appear. We argue that the vortex system offers significant advantages over other artificial ice systems. 
0808.03781	Radiation from relativistic jets	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:K.-I. Nishikawa, Y. Mizuno, P. Hardee, H. Sol, M. Medvedev, B. Zhang, A. Nordlund, J. T. Frederiksen, G. J. Fishman, R. Preece	Abstract:  Nonthermal radiation observed from astrophysical systems containing relativistic jets and shocks, e.g., gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and Galactic microquasar systems usually have power-law emission spectra. Recent PIC simulations of relativistic electron-ion (electron-positron) jets injected into a stationary medium show that particle acceleration occurs within the downstream jet. In the presence of relativistic jets, instabilities such as the Buneman instability, other two-streaming instability, and the Weibel (filamentation) instability create collisionless shocks, which are responsible for particle (electron, positron, and ion) acceleration. The simulation results show that the Weibel instability is responsible for generating and amplifying highly nonuniform, small-scale magnetic fields. These magnetic fields contribute to the electron's transverse deflection behind the jet head. The ``jitter'' radiation from deflected electrons in small-scale magnetic fields has different properties than synchrotron radiation which is calculated in a uniform magnetic field. This jitter radiation, a case of diffusive synchrotron radiation, may be important to understand the complex time evolution and/or spectral structure in gamma-ray bursts, relativistic jets, and supernova remnants. 
0808.03782	KBSM of the product of a disk with two holes and S^{1}	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Mieczyslaw K. Dabkowski (UTD), Maciej Mroczkowski (Univ. of Gdansk)    	Abstract:  We introduce diagrams and Reidemeister moves for links in FxS^{1}, where F is an orientable surface. Using these diagrams we compute (in a new way) the Kauffman Bracket Skein Modules (KBSM) for D^{2}xS^{1} and AxS^{1}, where D^{2} is a disk and A is an annulus. Moreover, we also find the KBSM for the F_{0,3}xS^{1}, where F_{0,3} denotes a disk with two holes, and thus show that the module is free. 
0808.03783	Angular correlations in three-jet events in ep collisions at HERA	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:ZEUS Collaboration: S. Chekanov, et al    	Abstract:  Three-jet production in deep inelastic ep scattering and photoproduction was investigated with the ZEUS detector at HERA using an integrated luminosity of 127 pb-1. Measurements of differential cross sections are presented as functions of angular correlations between the three jets in the final state and the proton-beam direction. These correlations provide a stringent test of perturbative QCD and show sensitivity to the contributions from different colour configurations. Fixed-order perturbative QCD calculations assuming the values of the colour factors C_F, C_A and T_F as derived from a variety of gauge groups were compared to the measurements to study the underlying gauge group symmetry. The measured angular correlations in the deep inelastic ep scattering and photoproduction regimes are consistent with the admixture of colour configurations as predicted by SU(3) and disfavour other symmetry groups, such as SU(N) in the limit of large N. 
0808.03784	Heavy Flavour Physics at CDF	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Gavril Giurgiu, for the CDF collaboration	Abstract:  The CDF detector at Fermilab has accumulated more that 3/fb of data which enables unprecedented studies of heavy flavor hadron properties. We present recent CDF measurements of mass and lifetime of the Bc meson as well as lifetime, mixing and CP violation properties of Bs mesons. 
0808.03785	Poincare recurrences and transient chaos in systems with leaks	Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)	Authors:Eduardo G. Altmann, Tamas Tel	Abstract:  In order to simulate observational and experimental situations, we consider a leak in the phase space of a chaotic dynamical system. We obtain an expression for the escape rate of the survival probability applying the theory of transient chaos. This expression improves previous estimates based on the properties of the closed system and explains dependencies on the position and size of the leak and on the initial ensemble. With a subtle choice of the initial ensemble, we obtain an equivalence to the classical problem of Poincare recurrences in closed systems, which is treated in the same framework. Finally, we show how our results apply to weakly chaotic systems and justify a split of the invariant saddle in hyperbolic and nonhyperbolic components, related, respectively, to the intermediate exponential and asymptotic power-law decays of the survival probability. 
0808.03786	Electromagnetic turbulence driven by the mixed mode instability	Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)	Authors:Jacob Trier Frederiksen, Mark Eric Dieckmann	Abstract:  In continuation of previous work, numerical results are presented, concerning relativistically counter-streaming plasmas. Here, the relativistic mixed mode instability evolves through, and beyond, the linear saturation -- well into the nonlinear regime. Besides confirming earlier findings, that wave power initially peaks on the mixed mode branch, it is observed that, during late time evolution wave power is transferred to other wave numbers. It is argued that the isotropization of power in wavenumber space may be a consequence of weak turbulence. Further, some modifications to the ideal weak turbulence limit is observed. Development of almost isotropic predominantly electrostatic -- partially electromagnetic -- turbulent spectra holds relevance when considering the spectral emission signatures of the plasma, namely bremsstrahlung, respectively magneto-bremsstrahlung (synchrotron radiation and jitter radiation) from relativistic shocks in astrophysical jets and shocks from gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. 
0808.03787	The Chiral Anomaly in SCET	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Wouter J. Waalewijn	Abstract:  Anomalies are an infrared effect, but are often realized in effective theories in a non-trivial way. We study the chiral anomaly in Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET), where the anomaly equation has terms contributing at different orders in the power expansion. The chiral anomaly equations in SCET are computed up to NNLO in the power counting with external collinear and/or ultrasoft gluons. We do this by expanding the QCD anomaly equation, using the tree level (LO in α_s) relations between QCD and SCET fields. The validity of this correspondence between the anomaly equations is confirmed by direct computation of the one-loop diagrams in SCET. 
0808.03788	Nonlinear Sigma Model Analysis of the AFM Phase Transition of the Kondo Lattice	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:T. Tzen Ong, B. A. Jones	Abstract:  We have studied the antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition of a 2D Kondo-Heisenberg square lattice using the non-linear sigma model. A renormalization group analysis of the competing Kondo -- RKKY interaction was carried out to 1-loop order in the $ε$ expansion, and a new quantum critical point is found, dominated by Kondo fluctuations. In addition, the spin-wave velocity scales logarithmically near the new QCP, i.e breakdown of hydrodynamic behavior. The results allow us to propose a new phase diagram near the AFM fixed point of this 2D Kondo lattice model. 
0808.03789	Magnetic phase evolution in the spinel compounds Zn$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Cr$_2$O$_4$	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Brent C. Melot, Jennifer E. Drewes, Ram Seshadri, Arthur P. Ramirez	Abstract:  We present the magnetic properties of complete solid solutions of ZnCr$_2$O$_4$ and CoCr$_2$O$_4$: two well-studied oxide spinels with very different magnetic ground states. ZnCr$_2$O$_4$, with non-magnetic $d^{10}$ cations occupying the A site and magnetic $d^3$ cations on the B site, is a highly frustrated antiferromagnet. CoCr$_2$O$_4$, with magnetic $d^7$ cations (three unpaired electrons) on the A site as well, exhibits both Néel ferrimagnetism as well as commensurate and incommensurate non-collinear magnetic order. More recently, CoCr$_2$O$_4$ has been studied extensively for its polar behavior which arises from conical magnetic ordering. Gradually introducing magnetism on the A site of ZnCr$_2$O$_4$ results in a transition from frustrated antiferromagnetism to glassy magnetism at low concentrations of Co, and eventually to ferrimagnetic and conical ground states at higher concentrations. Real-space Monte-Carlo simulations of the magnetic susceptibility suggest that the first magnetic ordering transition and features of the susceptibility across $x$ are captured by near-neighbor self- and cross-couplings between the magnetic A and B atoms. We present as a part of this study, a method for displaying the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility in a manner which helps distinguish between compounds possessing purely antiferromagnetic interactions from compounds where other kinds of ordering are present. 
0808.03790	Equilibrium policies when preferences are time inconsistent	Optimization and Control (math.OC)	Authors:Ivar Ekeland, Ali Lazrak	Abstract:  This paper characterizes differentiable and subgame Markov perfect equilibria in a continuous time intertemporal decision problem with non-constant discounting. Capturing the idea of non commitment by letting the commitment period being infinitesimally small, we characterize the equilibrium strategies by a value function, which must satisfy a certain equation. The equilibrium equation is reminiscent of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation of optimal control, but with a non-local term leading to differences in qualitative behavior. As an application, we formulate an overlapping generations Ramsey model where the government maximizes a utilitarian welfare function defined as the discounted sum of successive generations' lifetime utilities. When the social discount rate is different from the private discount rate, the optimal command allocation is time inconsistent and we retain subgame perfection as a principle of intergenerational equity. Existence of multiple subgame perfect equilibria is established. The multiplicity is due to the successive governments' inability to coordinate their beliefs and we single out one of them as (locally) renegotiation-proof. Decentralization can be achieved with both age and time dependent lump sum transfers and, long term distorting capital interest income taxes/subsidy. 
0808.03791	Light-cone expansion of heavy-to-light form factors	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Wolfgang Lucha, Dmitri Melikhov, Silvano Simula	Abstract:  We present the results of our recent systematic study of the light-cone expansion of heavy-to-light transition form factors in a model with scalar constituents [1]. We show that the higher-twist contributions (represented in this model by off-light-cone effects) all have the same behaviour in the 1/m_Q expansion. The suppression parameter of the higher-twist contributions compared to the lower-twist contributions is, in general, the inverse Borel parameter β. The only exception here is the case of the leading and the subleading twists: they are of the same order in 1/βbecause of an extra suppression of the leading-twist contribution to the form factor. 
0808.03792	Structural phases of strained LaAlO3 driven by octahedral tilt instabilities	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Alison J. Hatt, Nicola A. Spaldin	Abstract:  We investigate the effect of epitaxial strain on [001]-oriented LaAlO3 using first-principles density functional calculations. We find a series of structural phase transitions between states characterized by distinct patterns of tilting of the AlO6 octahedra. By tuning the biaxial strain from compressive to tensile, we induce an evolution in the crystal structure in which the tilt axis changes from out-of-plane to in-plane, corresponding to space groups I4/mcm and Imma. We also study the effect of uniaxial relaxation of the usual biaxial epitaxial constraint and explore this as a mechanism for selectively stabilizing different patterns of octahedral tilts. 
0808.03793	Curvature Effect of a Non-Power-Law Spectrum and Spectral Evolution of GRB X-Ray Tails	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Bin-Bin Zhang, Bing Zhang, En-Wei Liang, Xiang-Yu Wang	Abstract:  The apparent spectral evolution observed in the steep decay phase of many GRB early afterglows raises a great concern of the high-latitude "curvature effect" interpretation of this phase. However, previous curvature effect models only invoked a simple power law spectrum upon the cessation of the prompt internal emission. We investigate a model that invokes the "curvature effect" of a more general non-power-law spectrum and test this model with the Swift/XRT data of some GRBs. We show that one can reproduce both the observed lightcurve and the apparent spectral evolution of several GRBs using a model invoking a power-law spectrum with an exponential cut off. GRB 050814 is presented as an example. 
0808.03794	Symplectic fillings of links of quotient surface singularities	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Mohan Bhupal, Kaoru Ono	Abstract:  We study symplectic deformation types of minimal symplectic fillings of links of quotient surface singularities. In particular, there are only finitely many symplectic deformation types for each quotient surface singularity. 
0808.03795	Early Standard Model Measurement and Determination of Standard Model Background for Searches	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:S. Beauceron	Abstract:  The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva (Switzerland) will go in operation in the coming months and will soon enable us to analyze the highest energy collisions ever produced at an accelerator. Beyond Standard Model searches at LHC require a detailed understanding of the detector performance, reconstruction algorithms and triggering. Precision measurements of Standard Model processes are also mandatory to acquire the necessary knowledge of Standard Model background. Both ATLAS and CMS efforts are hence addressed to determine the best calibration candles and to design a realistic plan for the initial period of data taking. 
0808.03796	A New Hypoelliptic Operator on Almost CR Manifolds	Complex Variables (math.CV)	Authors:Raphael Ponge	Abstract:  The aim of this paper is to present the construction, out of the Kohn-Rossi complex, of a new hypoelliptic operator $Q_{L}$ on almost CR manifolds equipped with a real structure. The operator acts on all (p,q)-forms, but when restricted to (p,0)-forms and (p,n)-forms it is a sum of squares up to sign factor and lower order terms. Therefore, only a finite type condition condition is needed to have hypoellipticity on those forms. However, outside these forms $Q_{L}$ may fail to be hypoelliptic, as it is shown in the example of the Heisenberg group. We also look at the Fredholm properties of $Q_{L}$ and show that the corresponding Fredholm index is zero. 
0808.03797	Parton Distribution Functions: Impact of HERA	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:Kunihiro Nagano, for the H1, ZEUS Collaborations	Abstract:  Recent progresses of the proton structure measurements and determination of parton distribution functions by $ep$ collisions at HERA are introduced. 
0808.03798	Relative-Velocity-Dependent Weber-type Models in Electromagnetism	General Physics (physics.gen-ph)	Authors:Santosh Devasia	Abstract:  This article reconsiders the relative-velocity-dependent approach to modeling electromagnetism that was proposed initially by Weber before data from cathode-ray-tube (CRT) experiments was available. It is shown that identifying the nonlinear, relative-velocity terms using CRT data results in a model, which not only captures standard relativistic effects in optics, high-energy particles, and gravitation, but also explains apparent discrepancies between predicted and measured energy (i) in high-energy-particle absorption experiments and (ii) in the classical beta-ray spectrum of radium-E. 
0808.03799	Homotopy types of topological stacks	Algebraic Topology (math.AT)	Authors:Behrang Noohi	Abstract:  We define the notion of {\em classifying space} of a topological stack and show that every topological stack \X has a classifying space X which is a topological space well-defined up to weak homotopy equivalence. Under a certain paracompactness condition on \X, we show that X is actually well-defined up to homotopy equivalence. These results are formulated in terms of functors from the category of topological stacks to the (weak) homotopy category of topological spaces. We prove similar results for (small) diagrams of topological stacks. 
0808.03800	Meromorphic functions with linearly distributed values and Julia sets of rational functions	Complex Variables (math.CV)	Authors:Walter Bergweiler, Alexandre Eremenko	Abstract:  If the preimage of a four-point set under a meromorphic function belongs to the real line, then the image of the real line is contained in a circle in the Riemann sphere. We include an application of this result to holomorphic dynamics: if the Julia set of a rational function is contained in a smooth curve then it is contained in a circle. 
0808.03801	Numerical diagonalization analysis of the criticality of the (2+1)-dimensional XY model: Off-diagonal Novotny's method	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Yoshihiro Nishiyama (Okayama University)    	Abstract:  The criticality of the (2+1)-dimensional XY model is investigated with the numerical diagonalization method. So far, it has been considered that the diagonalization method would not be very suitable for analyzing the criticality in large dimensions (d \ge 3); in fact, the tractable system size with the diagonalization method is severely restricted. In this paper, we employ Novotny's method, which enables us to treat a variety of system sizes N=6,8,...,20 (N: the number of spins constituting a cluster). For that purpose, we develop an off-diagonal version of Novotny's method to adopt the off-diagonal (quantum-mechanical XY) interaction. Moreover, in order to improve the finite-size-scaling behavior, we tune the coupling-constant parameters to a scale-invariant point. As a result, we estimate the critical indices as ν=0.675(20) and γ/ν=1.97(10). 
0808.03802	Riesz $s$-equilibrium measures on $d$-rectifiable sets as $s$ approaches $d$	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:M. T. Calef, D. P. Hardin	Abstract:  Let $A$ be a compact set in ${\mathbb R}^p$ of Hausdorff dimension $d$. For $s\in(0,d)$, the Riesz $s$-equilibrium measure $μ^s$ is the unique Borel probability measure with support in $A$ that minimizes $$ I_s(μ):=\iint\frac{1}{|x-y|^s}dμ(y)dμ(x)$$ over all such probability measures. If $A$ is strongly $({\mathcal H}^d, d)$-rectifiable, then $μ^s$ converges in the weak-star topology to normalized $d$-dimensional Hausdorff measure restricted to $A$ as $s$ approaches $d$ from below. 
0808.03803	Casimir effect in toroidally compactified de Sitter spacetime	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:A. A. Saharian	Abstract:  Vacuum energy density and stresses are investigated for a scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter in (D+1)-dimensional de Sitter spacetime with an arbitrary number of toroidally compactified spatial dimensions. The corresponding expectation values are presented in the form of the sum of the vacuum expectation values in uncompactified dS spacetime and the part induced by the non-trivial topology. In the early stages of the cosmological evolution the topological parts dominate. In this limit the behavior of the Casimir densities does not depend on the curvature coupling parameter and coincides with that for a conformally coupled massless field. At late stages of the cosmological expansion the expectation values are dominated by the part corresponding to uncompactified dS spacetime. The vanishing of the topological parts is monotonic or oscillatory in dependence of the mass and the curvature coupling parameter of the field. 
0808.03804	Pixel Hit Reconstruction with the CMS Detector	Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)	Authors:Gavril A. Giurgiu, for the CMS collaboration	Abstract:  We present a new technique for pixel hit reconstruction with the CMS pixel detector. The technique is based on fitting the pixel cluster projections to templates obtained using a detailed simulation called Pixelav. Pixelav successfully describes the profiles of clusters measured in beam tests of radiation-damaged sensors. Originally developed to optimally estimate the coordinates of hits after the radiation damage, the technique has superior performance before irradiation as well, reducing the resolution tails of reconstructed track parameters and significantly reducing the light quark background of tagged b-quarks. It is the only technique currently available to simulate hits from a radiation-damaged detector. 
0808.03805	High-frequency corrections to the detector response and their effect on searches for gravitational waves	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:M. Rakhmanov, J. D. Romano, J. T. Whelan	Abstract:  Searches for gravitational waves with km-scale laser interferometers often involve the long-wavelength approximation to describe the detector response. The prevailing assumption is that the corrections to the detector response due to its finite size are small and the errors due to the long-wavelength approximation are negligible. Recently, however, Baskaran and Grishchuk (2004 Class. Quantum Grav. 21 4041) found that in a simple Michelson interferometer such errors can be as large as 10 percent. For more accurate analysis, these authors proposed to use a linear-frequency correction to the long wavelength approximation. In this paper we revisit these calculations. We show that the linear-frequency correction is inadequate for certain locations in the sky and therefore accurate analysis requires taking into account the exact formula, commonly derived from the photon round-trip propagation time. Also, we extend the calculations to include the effect of Fabry-Perot resonators in the interferometer arms. Here we show that a simple approximation which combines the long-wavelength Michelson response with the single-pole approximation to the Fabry-Perot transfer function produces rather accurate results. In particular, the difference between the exact and the approximate formulae is at most 2-3 percent for those locations in the sky where the detector response is greater than half of its maximum value. We analyse the impact of such errors on detection sensitivity and parameter estimation in searches for periodic gravitational waves emitted by a known pulsar, and in searches for an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background. At frequencies up to 1 kHz, the effect of such errors is at most 1-2 percent. For higher frequencies, or if more accuracy is required, one should use the exact formula for the response. 
0808.03806	Rotation and surface abundance peculiarities in A-type stars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yoichi Takeda, Inwoo Han, Dong-Il Kang, Byeong-Cheol Lee, Kang-Min Kim	Abstract:  In an attempt of clarifying the connection between the photospheric abundance anomalies and the stellar rotation as well as of exploring the nature of "normal A" stars, the abundances of seven elements (C, O, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Ba) and the projected rotational velocity for 46 A-type field stars were determined by applying the spectrum-fitting method to the high-dispersion spectral data obtained with BOES at BOAO. We found that the peculiarities (underabundances of C, O, and Ca; an overabundance of Ba) seen in slow rotators efficiently decrease with an increase of rotation, which almost disappear at v_e sin i > 100 km s^-1. This further suggests that stars with sufficiently large rotational velocity may retain the original composition at the surface without being altered. Considering the subsolar tendency (by several tenths dex below) exhibited by the elemental abundances of such rapidly-rotating (supposedly normal) A stars, we suspect that the gas metallicity may have decreased since our Sun was born, contrary to the common picture of galactic chemical evolution. 
0808.03807	Giant frictional drag in strongly interacting bilayers near filling factor one	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:E. Tutuc, R. Pillarisetty, M. Shayegan	Abstract:  We study the frictional drag in high mobility, strongly interacting GaAs bilayer hole systems in the vicinity of the filling factor $ν=1$ quantum Hall state (QHS), at the same fillings where the bilayer resistivity displays a reentrant insulating phase. Our measurements reveal a very large longitudinal drag resistivity ($ρ^{D}_{xx}$) in this regime, exceeding 15 k$Ω/\Box$ at filling factor $ν=1.15$. $ρ^{D}_{xx}$ shows a weak temperature dependence and appears to saturate at a finite, large value at the lowest temperatures. Our observations are consistent with theoretical models positing a phase separation, e.g. puddles of $ν=1$ QHS embedded in a different state, when the system makes a transition from the coherent $ν=1$ QHS to the weakly coupled $ν=2$ QHS. 
0808.03808	Differential equation for local magnetization in the boundary Ising model	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Oleg Miroshnichenko	Abstract:  We show that the local magnetization in the massive boundary Ising model on the half-plane with boundary magnetic field satisfies second order linear differential equation whose coefficients are expressed through Painleve function of the III kind. 
0808.03809	Orbital Selective Superconductivity in Two-Orbital Asymmetric t-J Models	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Feng Lu, Cui-Zhi Wang Wei-Hua Wang, Liang-Jian Zou	Abstract:  We present the zero-temperature superconducting (SC) ground states of the two-orbital asymmetric $t-J$ model on a square lattice by means of the auxiliary-boson approach. Besides the two-gap SC phase, we find an orbital selective SC (OSSC) phase, which is simultaneously SC in one orbit and normal in another orbit. The novel OSSC phase is stable only for sufficient asymmetric degree in orbital space and doping concentration. The pairing symmetry of the SC phase is s-wave-like in most doping regime, against the d-wave symmetry of the single-orbital $t-J$ model in a square lattice. The implication of the present scenario on multi-orbital heavy fermion and iron-based superconductors is also discussed. 
0808.03810	Bias and angular dependence of spin-transfer torque in magnetic tunnel junctions	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:C. Wang, Y.-T. Cui, J. Z. Sun, J. A. Katine, R. A. Buhrman, D. C. Ralph	Abstract:  We use spin-transfer-driven ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) to measure the spin-transfer torque vector T in MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions as a function of the offset angle between the magnetic moments of the electrodes and as a function of bias, V. We explain the conflicting conclusions of two previous experiments by accounting for additional terms that contribute to the ST-FMR signal at large |V|. Including the additional terms gives us improved precision in the determination of T(V), allowing us to distinguish among competing predictions. We determine that the in-plane component of has a weak but non-zero dependence on bias, varying by 30-35% over the bias range where the measurements are accurate, and that the perpendicular component can be large enough to be technologically significant. We also make comparisons to other experimental techniques that have been used to try to measure T(V). 
0808.03811	Some Characterizations of Domination	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Jairo Bochi, Nicolas Gourmelon	Abstract:  We show that a cocycle has a dominated splitting if and only if there is a uniform exponential gap between singular values of its iterates. Then we consider sets $Σ$ in $GL(d,\mathbb{R})$ with the property that any cocycle with values in $Σ$ has a dominated splitting. We characterize these sets in terms of existence of invariant multicones, thus extending a 2-dimensional result by Avila, Bochi, and Yoccoz. We give an example showing how these multicones can fail to have convexity properties. 
0808.03812	The Canis Major Star Forming Region	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jane Gregorio-Hetem	Abstract:  The shape of the main arc formed by the Canis Major clouds has been suggested to result from a supernova explosion possibly triggering the recent star formation activity. The presence of dozens of OB stars and reflection nebulae forms the CMa OB1/R1 associations. More than a hundred emission line stars are found in this region, including the famous Z CMa, a binary system containing a Herbig Be star and a FUor companion. Several embedded infrared clusters with different ages are associated with the CMa clouds. The main characteristics of the region in terms of cloud structure, stellar content, age of associated young clusters, distance, and X-ray emission are presented in this chapter. Some of the arguments in favor and against the hypothesis of induced star formation are discussed in the last section. 
0808.03813	Subaru Weak Lensing survey -- II: Multi-object Spectroscopy and Cluster Masses	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Takashi Hamana, Satoshi Miyazaki, Nobunari Kashikawa, Richard S. Ellis, Richard J. Massey, Alexandre Refregier, James E. Taylor	Abstract:  We present the first results of a MOS campaign to follow up cluster candidates located via weak lensing. Our main goals are to search for spatial concentrations of galaxies that are plausible optical counterparts of the weak lensing signals, and to determine the cluster redshifts from those of member galaxies. Around each of 36 targeted cluster candidates, we obtain 15-32 galaxy redshifts. For 28 of these targets, we confirm a secure cluster identification. This includes three cases where two clusters at different redshifts are projected along the same line-of-sight. In 6 of the 8 unconfirmed targets, we find multiple small galaxy concentrations at different redshifts. In both the remaining two targets, a single small galaxy concentration is found. We evaluate the weak lensing mass of confirmed clusters. For a subsample of our most cleanly measured clusters, we investigate the statistical relation between their weak lensing mass and the velocity dispersion of their member galaxies, comparing our sample with optically and X-ray selected samples from the literature. Our lensing-selected clusters are consistent with sigma_v=sigma_sis, with a similar scatter to the optically and X-ray selected clusters. We thus find no evidence of selection bias compared to these other techniques. We also derive an empirical relation between the cluster mass and the galaxy velocity dispersion, which is in reasonable agreement with the prediction of N-body simulations in the LCDM cosmology. 
0808.03814	The Optimal Spatially-Smoothed Source Patterns for the Pseudospectral Time-Domain Method	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Zhili Lin	Abstract:  Spatially-smoothed sources are often utilized in the pseudospectral time-domain (PSTD) method to suppress the associated aliasing errors to levels as low as possible. In this work, the explicit conditions of the optimal source patterns for these spanning sources are presented based on the fact that the aliasing errors are mainly attributed to the high spatial-frequency parts of the time-stepped source items and subsequently demonstrated to be exactly corresponding to the normalized rows of Pascal's triangle. The outstanding performance of these optimal sources is verified by the practical 1-D, 2-D and 3-D PSTD simulations and compared with that of non-optimal sources. 
0808.03815	NGC 2362: The Terminus of Star Formation	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. E. Dahm	Abstract:  NGC 2362 is a richly populated Galactic cluster, devoid of natal molecular gas and dust. The cluster represents the final product of the star forming process and hosts an unobscured and near-complete initial mass function. NGC 2362 is dominated by the O9 Ib multiple star, tau CMa, as well as several dozen unevolved B-type stars. Distributed throughout the cluster are several hundred suspected intermediate and low-mass pre-main sequence members. Various post-main sequence evolutionary models have been used to infer an age of 5 Myr for the one evolved member, tau CMa. These estimates are in close agreement with the ages derived by fitting pre-main sequence isochrones to the contracting, low-mass stellar population of the cluster. The extremely narrow sequence of stars, which extends more than 9 mag in the optical color-magnitude diagram, suggests that star formation within the cluster occurred rapidly and coevally across the full mass spectrum. Ground-based near infrared and H-alpha emission surveys of NGC 2362 concluded that most (~90%) of the low-mass members have already dissipated their optically-thick, inner(< 1 AU) circumstellar disks. Spitzer IRAC observations of the cluster have confirmed these results, placing an upper limit on the primordial, optically thick disk fraction of the cluster at 7(+/-)2%. The presence of circumstellar disks among candidate members of NGC 2362 is also strongly mass-dependent, such that no stars more massive than 1.2 Msun exhibit significant infrared excess shortward of 8 microns. The well-defined upper main sequence of NGC 2362, its large population of low-mass stars, and the narrow age spread evident in the color-magnitude diagram ensure its role as a standard model of cluster as well as stellar evolution. 
0808.03816	How Cooper pairs vanish approaching the Mott insulator in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Y. Kohsaka, C. Taylor, P. Wahl, A. Schmidt, Jhinhwan Lee, K. Fujita, J. W. Alldredge, Jinho Lee, K. McElroy, H. Eisaki, S. Uchida, D.-H. Lee, J. C. Davis	Abstract:  The antiferromagnetic ground state of copper oxide Mott insulators is achieved by localizing an electron at each copper atom in real space (r-space). Removing a small fraction of these electrons (hole doping) transforms this system into a superconducting fluid of delocalized Cooper pairs in momentum space (k-space). During this transformation, two distinctive classes of electronic excitations appear. At high energies, the enigmatic 'pseudogap' excitations are found, whereas, at lower energies, Bogoliubov quasi-particles -- the excitations resulting from the breaking of Cooper pairs -- should exist. To explore this transformation, and to identify the two excitation types, we have imaged the electronic structure of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d in r-space and k-space simultaneously. We find that although the low energy excitations are indeed Bogoliubov quasi-particles, they occupy only a restricted region of k-space that shrinks rapidly with diminishing hole density. Concomitantly, spectral weight is transferred to higher energy r-space states that lack the characteristics of excitations from delocalized Cooper pairs. Instead, these states break translational and rotational symmetries locally at the atomic scale in an energy independent fashion. We demonstrate that these unusual r-space excitations are, in fact, the pseudogap states. Thus, as the Mott insulating state is approached by decreasing the hole density, the delocalized Cooper pairs vanish from k-space, to be replaced by locally translational- and rotational-symmetry-breaking pseudogap states in r-space. 
0808.03817	Exoplanet characterization with long slit spectroscopy	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Arthur Vigan, Maud Langlois, Claire Moutou, Kjetil Dohlen	Abstract:  Extrasolar planets observation and characterization by high contrast imaging instruments is set to be a very important subject in observational astronomy. Dedicated instruments are being developed to achieve this goal with very high efficiency. In particular, full spectroscopic characterization of low temperature planetary companions is an extremely important milestone. We present a new data analysis method for long slit spectroscopy (LSS) with coronagraphy, which allows characterization of planetary companions of low effective temperature. In a speckle-limited regime, this method allows an accurate estimation and subtraction of the scattered starlight, to extract a clean spectrum of the planetary companion. We performed intensive LSS simulations with IDL/CAOS to obtain realistic spectra of low (R=35) and medium (R=400) resolution in the J, H, and K bands. The simulated spectra were used to test our method and estimate its performance in terms of contrast reduction and extracted spectra quality. Our simulations are based on a software package dedicated to the development of SPHERE, a second generation instrument for the ESO-VLT. Our method allows a contrast reduction of 0.5 to 2.0 magnitudes compared to the coronagraphic observations. For M0 and G0 stars located at 10 pc, we show that it would lead to the characterization of companions with Teff of 600 K and 900 K respectively, at angular separations of 1.0 as. We also show that errors in the wavelength calibration can produce significant errors in the characterization, and must therefore be minimized as much as possible. 
0808.03818	A Disk of Young Stars at the Galactic Center as Determined by Individual Stellar Orbits	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. R. Lu, A. M. Ghez, S. D. Hornstein, M. R. Morris, E. E. Becklin, K. Matthews	Abstract:  We present new proper motions from the 10 m Keck telescopes for a puzzling population of massive, young stars located within 3.5" (0.14 pc) of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center. Our proper motion measurements have uncertainties of only 0.07 mas/yr (3 km/s), which is ~7 times better than previous proper motion measurements for these stars, and enables us to measure accelerations as low as 0.2 mas/yr^2 (7 km/s/yr). Using these measurements, line-of-sight velocities from the literature, and 3D velocities for additional young stars in the central parsec, we constrain the true orbit of each individual star and directly test the hypothesis that the massive stars reside in two stellar disks as has been previously proposed. Analysis of the stellar orbits reveals only one of the previously proposed disks of young stars using a method that is capable of detecting disks containing at least 7 stars. The detected disk contains 50% of the young stars, is inclined by ~115 deg from the plane of the sky, and is oriented at a position angle of ~100 deg East of North. Additionally, the on-disk and off-disk populations have similar K-band luminosity functions and radial distributions that decrease at larger projected radii as \propto r^-2. The disk has an out-of-the-disk velocity dispersion of 28 +/- 6 km/s, which corresponds to a half-opening angle of 7 +/- 2 deg, and several candidate disk members have eccentricities greater than 0.2. Our findings suggest that the young stars may have formed in situ but in a more complex geometry than a simple, thin circular disk. 
0808.03819	Towards a definition of quantum integrability	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:J. Clemente-Gallardo, G. Marmo	Abstract:  We briefly review the most relevant aspects of complete integrability for classical systems and identify those aspects which should be present in a definition of quantum integrability. We show that a naive extension of classical concepts to the quantum framework would not work because all infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces are unitarily isomorphic and, as a consequence, it would not be easy to define degrees of freedom. We argue that a geometrical formulation of quantum mechanics might provide a way out. 
0808.03820	Does the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1814-338 precess?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:C. T. Y. Chung, D. K. Galloway, A. Melatos	Abstract:  Precession in an accretion-powered pulsar is expected to produce characteristic variations in the pulse properties. Assuming surface intensity maps with one and two hotspots, we compute theoretically the periodic modulation of the mean flux, pulse-phase residuals and fractional amplitudes of the first and second harmonic of the pulse profiles. These quantities are characterised in terms of their relative precession phase offsets. We then search for these signatures in 37 days of X-ray timing data from the accreting millisecond pulsar XTE J1814-338. We analyse a 12.2-d modulation observed previously and show that it is consistent with a freely precessing neutron star only if the inclination angle is < 0.1 degrees, an a priori unlikely orientation. We conclude that if the observed flux variations are due to precession, our model incompletely describes the relative precession phase offsets (e.g. the surface intensity map is over-simplified). We are still able to place an upper limit on εof 3.0 x 10^{-9} independently of our model, and estimate the phase-independent tilt angle θ; to lie roughly between 5 and 10 degrees. On the other hand, if the observed flux variations are not due to precession, the detected signal serves as a firm upper limit for any underlying precession signal. We then place an upper limit on the product εcos(θ) of \leq 9.9 x 10^{-10}. The first scenario translates into a maximum gravitational wave strain of 10^{-27} from XTE J1814-338 (assuming a distance of 8 kpc), and a corresponding signal-to-noise ratio of \leq 10^{-3} (for a 120 day integration time) for the advanced LIGO ground-based gravitational wave detector. 
0808.03821	Fluctuation-induced first-order transition in $p $-wave superconductors	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Qi Li, D. Belitz, John Toner	Abstract:  The problem of a fluctuation-induced first-order transition is considered for $p $-wave superconductors. Both an $ε$-expansion about $d=4$ and a large-$n$ expansion conclude that the transition for the physical case $n=6$ in $d=3$ is of first order, as in the s-wave case. 
0808.03822	Pion properties at finite density	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Seung-il Nam, Hyun-Chul Kim	Abstract:  In this talk, we report our recent work on the pion weak decay constant (F_pi) and pion mass (m_pi) using the nonlocal chiral quark model with the finite quark-number chemical potential (mu) taken into account. Considering the breakdown of Lorentz invariance at finite density, the time and space components are computed separately, and the corresponding results turn out to be: F^t_pi = 82.96 MeV and F^s_pi = 80.29 MeV at mu_c ~ 320 MeV, respectively. Using the in-medium Gell-Mann Oakes-Renner (GOR) relation, we show that the pion mass increases by about 15% at mu_c. 
0808.03823	Formation and Transformation of Vector-Solitons in Two-Species Bose-Einstein Condensates with Tunable Interaction	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Xunxu Liu, Han Pu, Bo Xiong, W. M. Liu, Jiangbin Gong	Abstract:  Under a unified theory we investigate the formation of various types of vector-solitons in two-species Bose-Einstein condensates with arbitrary scattering lengths. We then show that by tuning the interaction parameter via Feshbach resonance, transformation between different types of vector solitons is possible. Our results open up new ways in the quantum control of multi-species Bose-Einstein condensates. 
0808.03824	Scaling law and stability for a noisy quantum system	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Mark Sadgrove, Sandro Wimberger, Scott Parkins, Rainer Leonhardt	Abstract:  We show that a scaling law exists for the near resonant dynamics of cold kicked atoms in the presence of a randomly fluctuating pulse amplitude. Analysis of a quasi-classical phase-space representation of the quantum system with noise allows a new scaling law to be deduced. The scaling law and associated stability are confirmed by comparison with quantum simulations and experimental data. 
0808.03825	On the Koszul Betti numbers in positive characteristic	Commutative Algebra (math.AC)	Authors:A. V. Jayanthan, Ramakrishna Nanduri	Abstract:  We have observed a gap in one of the arguments in the main theorem. We choose to withdraw the paper until we rectify the gap. 
0808.03826	Ground-state energy of the unitary Fermi gas from the epsilon expansion	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Yusuke Nishida	Abstract:  We update the ground-state energy ratio of unitary Fermi gas to noninteracting Fermi gas (xi) from the epsilon expansion by including the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) term near two spatial dimensions. Interpolations of the NNLO epsilon expansions around four and two spatial dimensions with the use of Pade approximants give xi=0.360+/-0.020 in three dimensions with the uncertainty due to different interpolation functions. This value is consistent with the previous interpolations of the NLO epsilon expansions xi=0.377+/-0.014 in spite of the large NNLO corrections. 
0808.03827	Spatially Resolved Mapping of Local Polarization Dynamics in an Ergodic Phase of Ferroelectric Relaxor	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:S.V. Kalinin, B.J. Rodriguez, J.D. Budai, S. Jesse, A.N. Morozovska, A.A. Bokov, Z.-G. Ye	Abstract:  Spatial variability of polarization relaxation kinetics in relaxor ferroelectric 0.9Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-0.1PbTiO3 is studied using time-resolved Piezoresponse Force Microscopy. Local relaxation attributed to the reorientation of polar nanoregions is shown to follow stretched exponential dependence, exp(-(t/tau)^beta), with beta~~0.4, much larger than the macroscopic value determined from dielectric spectra (beta~~0.09). The spatial inhomogeneity of relaxation time distributions with the presence of 100-200 nm "fast" and "slow" regions is observed. The results are analyzed to map the Vogel-Fulcher temperatures on the nanoscale. 
0808.03828	Time Delay in Robertson-McVittie Spacetime and its Application to Increase of Astronomical Unit	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Hideyoshi Arakida	Abstract:  We investigated the light propagation by means of the Robertson-McVittie solution which is considered to be the spacetime around the gravitating body embedded in the FLRW (Friedmann-Lema{î}tre-Robertson-Walker) background metric. We concentrated on the time delay and derived the correction terms with respect to the Shapiro's formula. To relate with the actual observation and its reduction process, we also took account of the time transformations; coordinate time to proper one, and conversely, proper time to coordinate one. We applied these results to the problem of increase of astronomical unit reported by Krasinsky and Brumberg (2004). However, we found the influence of the cosmological expansion on the light propagation does not give an explanation of observed value, $d{\rm AU}/dt = 15 \pm 4$ [m/century] in the framework of Robertson-McVittie metric. 
0808.03829	The Kondo Lattice Model in Infinite Dimensions I. Formalism	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Junya Otsuki, Hiroaki Kusunose, Yoshio Kuramoto	Abstract:  A Green-function formalism for the Kondo lattice model is presented, which is designed to be combined with the dynamical mean-field theory. With use of Wick's theorem only for conduction electrons, dynamical quantities are represented in terms of the t-matrix and its two-particle generalizations. By taking the high-frequency limit of the t-matrix with respect to a part of the fermion frequencies, one obtains dynamical correlation functions of localized moments. Explicit examples of calculational steps are provided with use of the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method. 
0808.03830	Singly differential cross sections with exchange for Ps-fragmentation	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:Hasi Ray	Abstract:  Ps ionization in Ps-atom scattering is of fundamental importance. The singly differential cross sections (SDCS) provides more accurate information to test a theory than integrated or total ionization cross section since the averaging over one parameter is not required. We evaluate the SDCS for Ps-ionization with respect to the longitudinal energy distribution of the break-up positron and electron in Ps-H and Ps-He scattering and compare them with the recently available experimental and theoretical data. 
0808.03831	Controlling soliton interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates by synchronizing the Feshbach resonance and harmonic trap	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Xiao-Fei Zhang, Qin Yang, Jie-Fang Zhang, X. Z. Chen, W. M. Liu	Abstract:  We present how to control interactions between solitons, either bright or dark, in Bose-Einstein condensates by synchronizing Feshbach resonance and harmonic trap. Our results show that as long as the scattering length is to be modulated in time via a changing magnetic field near the Feshbach resonance, and the harmonic trapping frequencies are also modulated in time, exact solutions of the one-dimensional nonlinear Schrödinger equation can be found in a general closed form, and interactions between two solitons are modulated in detail in currently experimental conditions. We also propose experimental protocols to observe the phenomena such as fusion, fission, warp, oscillation, elastic collision in future experiments. 
0808.03832	The Four-Loop Konishi in N=4 SYM	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:V.N. Velizhanin (St. Petersburg, INP)    	Abstract:  We present the result of a full direct component calculation for the planar four-loop anomalous dimension of the Konishi operator in N =4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Our result confirms the results obtained from superfield (arXiv:0712.3522, arXiv:0806.2095) and superstring (arXiv:0807.0399) computations, which take into account finite size corrections to the all-loop asymptotic Bethe ansatz for the integrable models describing the spectrum of the anomalous dimensions of the gauge-invariant operators and the spectrum of the string states in the framework of the gauge/string duality. 
0808.03833	Algorithmic enumeration of ideal classes for quaternion orders	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Markus Kirschmer, John Voight	Abstract:  We provide algorithms to count and enumerate representatives of the (right) ideal classes of an Eichler order in a quaternion algebra defined over a number field. We analyze the run time of these algorithms and consider several related problems, including the computation of two-sided ideal classes, isomorphism classes of orders, connecting ideals for orders, and ideal principalization. We conclude by giving the complete list of definite Eichler orders with class number at most 2. 
0808.03834	Noncentrosymmetric Commensurate Magnetic Ordering of Multiferroic ErMn2O5	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:B. Roessli (1), P. Fischer (1), P.J. Brown (2), M. Janoschek (1,3), D. Sheptyakov (1), S.N. Gvasaliya (1), B. Ouladdiaf (3), O. Zaharko (1), Eu. Golovenchits (4), V. Sanina (4) ((1) Laboratory for Neutron Scattering, ETH Zurich & Paul Scherrer (Institut), (2) Institut Laue-Langevin, (3) Technische Universit\"at M\"unchen, Garching, Germany (4) Ioffe Physical Thechnical Institute of Russian Academy of Science, Russia)    	Abstract:  The non-centrosymmetric magnetic structure of ErMn$_2$O$_5$ has been shown to be very similar to that of HoMn$_2$O$_5$ (Vecchini {\it et al.}, 2008 Phys. Rev. B {\bf 77} 134434). The magnetic modulation at 25 K has propagation vector $\vec k$=(1/2,0,1/4) and the symmetry imposes very few constraints on the magnetic configurations allowed. Only by combining the results of bulk magnetisation measurements, powder and single crystal neutron diffraction and spherical neutron polarization analysis was it possible to distinguish clearly between different models. The susceptibility measurements show that the erbium magnetic moments are aligned parallel to the c-axis indicating strong single-ion anisotropy. Spherical neutron polarimetry demonstrates the presence of two unequally populated chirality domains in ErMn$_2$O$_5$ single crystals. X-ray diffraction measurements on an ErMn$_2$O$_5$ powder using synchrotron radiation show that the buckling angles of the Mn-O-Mn bond change below the transition to the ferroelectric phase. 
0808.03835	The Young Cluster and Star Forming Region NGC 2264	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. E. Dahm	Abstract:  NGC 2264 is a young Galactic cluster and the dominant component of the Mon OB1 association lying approximately 760 pc distant within the local spiral arm. The cluster is hierarchically structured, with subclusters of suspected members spread across several parsecs. Associated with the cluster is an extensive molecular cloud complex spanning more than two degrees on the sky. Star formation is ongoing within the region as evidenced by the presence of numerous embedded clusters of protostars, molecular outflows, and Herbig-Haro objects. The stellar population of NGC 2264 is dominated by the O7 V multiple star, S Mon, and several dozen B-type zero-age main sequence stars. X-ray imaging surveys, H-alpha emission surveys, and photometric variability studies have identified more than 600 intermediate and low-mass members distributed throughout the molecular cloud complex, but concentrated within two densely populated areas between S Mon and the Cone Nebula. Estimates for the total stellar population of the cluster range as high as 1000 members and limited deep photometric surveys have identified 230 substellar mass candidates. The median age of NGC 2264 is estimated to be 3 Myr, but an apparent age dispersion of at least 5 Myr can be inferred from the broadened sequence of suspected members. Infrared and millimeter observations of the cluster have identified two prominent sites of star formation activity centered near NGC 2264 IRS1, a deeply embedded early-type star, and IRS2, a star forming core and associated protostellar cluster. Given its relative proximity, well-defined stellar population, and low foreground extinction, the cluster will remain a prime candidate for star formation studies throughout the foreseeable future. 
0808.03836	Soft Modes and Relaxor Ferroelectrics	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:R.A. Cowley (1), S.N. Gvasaliya (2), B. Roessli (2) ((1) Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford, Oxford (2) Laboratory for Neutron Scattering ETH Zurich and Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzerland)    	Abstract:  Relaxor ferroelectrics are difficult to study and understand. The experiment shows that at low energy scattering there is an acoustic mode, an optic mode, dynamic quasi-elastic scattering and strictly elastic scattering as well as Bragg peaks at the zone centre. We have studied the scattering using the TASP spectrometer at PSI and have analysed the data using a model with interactions between the different components particularly to determine the properties of the elastic scattering. The quasi-elastic scattering begins to become significant at the Burns temperature of 620 K. It steadily increases in intensity on cooling reaching a maximum at ~400 K. Below this temperature the strictly elastic scattering begins to increase and shows a broadened line shape characteristic of crystals in a random applied field. We show that all the results obtained from PMN for the elastic scattering are consistent with the crystal having a random field transition at ~400 K. We have obtained similar results for PMN-PT and PZN-PT suggesting that random fields of the nano-regions also play an important role in these materials. 
0808.03837	Accelerometer using atomic waves for space applications	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:Arnaud Landragin (SYRTE), Franck Pereira Dos Santos (SYRTE)    	Abstract:  The techniques of laser cooling combined with atom interferometry make possible the realization of very sensitive and accurate inertial sensors like gyroscopes or accelerometers. Besides earth-based developments, the use of these techniques in space should provide extremely high sensitivity for research in fundamental physics, Earth's observation and exploration of the solar system. 
0808.03838	Minimal hypersurfaces in $\HH^n \times \R$, total curvature and index	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Pierre Bérard (IF), Ricardo Sa Earp	Abstract:  In this paper, we consider minimal hypersurfaces in the product space $\mathbb{H}^n \times \mathbb{R}$. We begin by studying examples of rotation hypersurfaces and hypersurfaces invariant under hyperbolic translations. We then consider minimal hypersurfaces with finite total curvature. This assumption implies that the corresponding curvature goes to zero uniformly at infinity. We show that surfaces with finite total intrinsic curvature have finite index. The converse statement is not true as shown by our examples which also serve as useful barriers. 
0808.03839	A high order purely frequency-based harmonic balance formulation for continuation of periodic solutions	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Bruno Cochelin (LMA), Christophe Vergez (LMA)    	Abstract:  Combinig the harmonic balance method (HBM) and a continuation method is a well-known technique to follow the periodic solutions of dynamical systems when a control parameter is varied. However, since deriving the algebraic system containing the Fourier coefficients can be a highly cumbersome procedure, the classical HBM is often limited to polynomial (quadratic and cubic) nonlinearities and/or a few harmonics. Several variations on the classical HBM, such as the incremental HBM or the alternating frequency/time domain HBM, have been presented in the literature to overcome this shortcoming. Here, we present an alternative approach that can be applied to a very large class of dynamical systems (autonomous or forced) with smooth equations. The main idea is to systematically recast the dynamical system in quadratic polynomial form before applying the HBM. Once the equations have been rendered quadratic, it becomes obvious to derive the algebraic system and solve it by the so-called ANM continuation technique. Several classical examples are presented to illustrate the use of this numerical approach. 
0808.03840	On the Pfister Number of Quadratic Forms	Rings and Algebras (math.RA)	Authors:R. Parimala, V. Suresh, J.-P. Tignol	Abstract:  The generic quadratic form of even dimension n with trivial discriminant over an arbitrary field of characteristic different from 2 containing a square root of -1 can be written in the Witt ring as a sum of 2-fold Pfister forms using n-2 terms and not less. The number of 2-fold Pfister forms needed to express a quadratic form of dimension 6 with trivial discriminant is determined in various cases. 
0808.03841	Tetrahedra on deformed spheres and integral group cohomology	Algebraic Topology (math.AT)	Authors:Pavle V. M. Blagojevic, Günter M. Ziegler	Abstract:  We show that for every injective continuous map f: S^2 --> R^3 there are four distinct points in the image of f such that the convex hull is a tetrahedron with the property that two opposite edges have the same length and the other four edges are also of equal length. This result represents a partial result for the topological Borsuk problem for R^3. Our proof of the geometrical claim, via Fadell-Husseini index theory, provides an instance where arguments based on group cohomology with integer coefficients yield results that cannot be accessed using only field coefficients. 
0808.03842	Directed polymer in random environment and last passage percolation	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Philippe Carmona (LMJL)    	Abstract:  The sequence of random probability measures $ν_n$ that gives a path of length $n$, $\unsur{n}$ times the sum of the random weights collected along the paths, is shown to satisfy a large deviations principle with good rate function the Legendre transform of the free energy of the associated directed polymer in a random environment. Consequences on the asymptotics of the typical number of paths whose collected weight is above a fixed proportion are then drawn. 
0808.03843	Radio observations of Jupiter-family comets	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. Crovisier, N. Biver, D. Bockelée-Morvan, P. Colom	Abstract:  Radio observations from decimetric to submillimetric wavelengths are now a basic tool for the investigation of comets. Spectroscopic observations allow us i) to monitor the gas production rate of the comets, by directly observing the water molecule, or by observing secondary products (e.g., the OH radical) or minor species (e.g., HCN); ii) to investigate the chemical composition of comets; iii) to probe the physical conditions of cometary atmospheres: kinetic temperature and expansion velocity. Continuum observations probe large-size dust particles and (for the largest objects) cometary nuclei. Comets are classified from their orbital characteristics into two separate classes: i) nearly-isotropic, mainly long-period comets and ii) ecliptic, short-period comets, the so-called Jupiter-family comets. These two classes apparently come from two different reservoirs, respectively the Oort cloud and the trans-Neptunian scattered disc. Due to their different history and - possibly - their different origin, they may have different chemical and physical properties that are worth being investigated. The present article reviews the contribution of radio observations to our knowledge of the Jupiter-family comets (JFCs). The difficulty of such a study is the commonly low gas and dust productions of these comets. Long-period, nearly-isotropic comets from the Oort cloud are better known from Earth-based observations. On the other hand, Jupiter-family comets are more easily accessed by space missions. However, unique opportunities to observe Jupiter-family comets are offered when these objects come by chance close to the Earth. About a dozen JFCs were successfully observed by radio techniques up to now. No obvious evidence for different properties between JFCs and other families of comets is found. 
0808.03844	Optimal State Discrimination in General Probabilistic Theories	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Gen Kimura, Takayuki Miyadera, Hideki Imai	Abstract:  We investigate a state discrimination problem in operationally the most general framework to use a probability, including both classical, quantum theories, and more. In this wide framework, introducing closely related family of ensembles (which we call a {\it Helstrom family of ensembles}) with the problem, we provide a geometrical method to find an optimal measurement for state discrimination by means of Bayesian strategy. We illustrate our method in 2-level quantum systems and in a probabilistic model with square-state space to reproduce e.g., the optimal success probabilities for binary state discrimination and $N$ numbers of symmetric quantum states. The existences of families of ensembles in binary cases are shown both in classical and quantum theories in any generic cases. 
0808.03845	Entropy of Self-Gravitating Systems from Holst's Lagrangian	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:L. Fatibene, M.Ferraris, M.Francaviglia, G.Pacchiella	Abstract:  We shall prove here that conservation laws from Holst's Lagrangian, often used in LQG, do not agree with the corresponding conservation laws in standard GR. Nevertheless, these differences vanish on-shell, i.e. along solutions, so that they eventually define the same classical conserved quantities. Accordingly, they define in particular the same entropy of solutions, and the standard law S=A/4 is reproduced for systems described by Holst's Lagragian. This provides the classical support to the computation usually done in LQG for the entropy of black holes which is in turn used to fix the Barbero-Immirzi parameter. 
0808.03846	Suzaku Observations of SGR 1900+14 and SGR 1806-20	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yujin E. Nakagawa, Tatehiro Mihara, Atsumasa Yoshida, Kazutaka Yamaoka, Satoshi Sugita, Toshio Murakami, Daisuke Yonetoku, Motoko Suzuki, Motoki Nakajima, Makoto Tashiro, Kazuhiro Nakazawa	Abstract:  Spectral and timing studies of Suzaku ToO observations of two SGRs, 1900+14 and 1806-20, are presented. The X-ray quiescent emission spectra were well fitted by a two blackbody function or a blackbody plus a power law model. The non-thermal hard component discovered by INTEGRAL was detected by the PIN diodes and its spectrum was reproduced by the power law model reported by INTEGRAL. The XIS detected periodicity P = 5.1998+/-0.0002 s for SGR 1900+14 and P = 7.6022+/-0.0007 s for SGR 1806-20. The pulsed fraction was related to the burst activity for SGR 1900+14. 
0808.03847	The star ingesting luminosity of intermediate mass black holes in globular clusters	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, Stephan Rosswog	Abstract:  The dynamics of stars in the inner regions of nearby globular clusters (GCs) such as G1 indicate the presence of central concentrated dark masses, and one would like to know whether these are indeed intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs). As the number of surrounding stars, and their motions, are roughly known, the capture rate can be estimated; the question then arises of whether the apparent quiescence of the nuclei of these GCs is compatible with the IMBH's presence. The role of debris from disrupted stars in activating quiescent nuclei of GCs is studied here employing three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations. It is argued that when individual stars are disrupted, the bulk of the debris would be swallowed or expelled rapidly compared with the interval between successive disruptions. Only a small fraction of the tightly bound mass is likely to be swallowed, yielding radiation with high efficiency, the surplus being expelled in a radiation-driven wind. A transient (predominantly of soft X-ray emission) signal could persist steadily with L ~ L_Edd =10^{41}(M_h/10^3M_sun) erg/s for at most tens of years; thereafter the flare would rapidly fade. While the infall rate declines as t^{-5/3}, some material may be stored for a longer time in an accretion disk. The IMBH luminosity could then remain as high as L_X > 10^{39} erg/s for several hundreds of years after disruption. In a given object, this ultraluminous X-ray activity would have a duty cycle of order 10^{-4}. Quiescent GCs, those with IMBHs now starved of fuel, should greatly outnumber active ones; observational constraints would not then be stringent until we had observed enough candidates to constitute a proper ensemble average.(abridged) 
0808.03848	Prevalence of the adiabatic exchange-correlation potential approximation in time-dependent density functional theory	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Roi Baer	Abstract:  Time-dependent (TD) density functional theory (TDDFT) promises a numerically tractable account of many-body electron dynamics provided good simple approximations are developed for the exchange-correlation (XC) potential functional (XCPF). The theory is usually applied within the adiabatic XCPF approximation, appropriate for slowly varying TD driving fields. As the frequency and strength of these fields grows, it is widely held that memory effects kick in and the eligibility of the adiabatic XCPF approximation deteriorates irreversibly. We point out however that when a finite system of electrons in its ground-state is gradually exposed to a very a high-frequency and eventually ultra-strong homogeneous electric field, the adiabatic XCPF approximation is in fact rigorously applicable. This result not only helps to explain recent numerical results for a 1D-helium atom subject to a strong linearly-polarized laser pulse (Thiel et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 153004, (2008)) but also shows that it is applicable to any number of electrons and in full 3D. 
0808.03849	Three-Qubit Operators, the Split Cayley Hexagon of Order Two and Black Holes	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Peter Levay (BUTE), Metod Saniga (ASTRINSTSAV), Peter Vrana (BUTE)    	Abstract:  The set of 63 real generalized Pauli matrices of three-qubits can be factored into two subsets of 35 symmetric and 28 antisymmetric elements. This splitting is shown to be completely embodied in the properties of the Fano plane; the elements of the former set being in a bijective correspondence with the 7 points, 7 lines and 21 flags, whereas those of the latter set having their counterparts in 28 anti-flags of the plane. This representation naturally extends to the one in terms of the split Cayley hexagon of order two. 63 points of the hexagon split into 9 orbits of 7 points (operators) each under the action of an automorphism of order 7. 63 lines of the hexagon carry three points each and represent the triples of operators such that the product of any two gives, up to a sign, the third one. Since this hexagon admits a full embedding in a projective 5-space over GF(2), the 35 symmetric operators are also found to answer to the points of a Klein quadric in such space. The 28 antisymmetric matrices can be associated with the 28 vertices of the Coxeter graph, one of two distinguished subgraphs of the hexagon. The PSL_{2}(7) subgroup of the automorphism group of the hexagon is discussed in detail and the Coxeter sub-geometry is found to be intricately related to the E_7-symmetric black-hole entropy formula in string theory. It is also conjectured that the full geometry/symmetry of the hexagon should manifest itself in the corresponding black-hole solutions. Finally, an intriguing analogy with the case of Hopf sphere fibrations and a link with coding theory are briefly mentioned. 
0808.03850	Catalogue of 12CO(J=1-0) and 13CO(J=1-0) Molecular Clouds in the Carina Flare Supershell	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. R. Dawson, A. Kawamura, N. Mizuno, T. Onishi, Y. Fukui	Abstract:  We present a catalogue of 12CO(J=1-0) and 13CO(J=1-0) molecular clouds in the spatio-velocity range of the Carina Flare supershell, GSH 287+04-17. The data cover a region of ~66 square degrees and were taken with the NANTEN 4m telescope, at spatial and velocity resolutions of 2.6' and 0.1 km/s. Decomposition of the emission results in the identification of 156 12CO clouds and 60 13CO clouds, for which we provide observational and physical parameters. Previous work suggests the majority of the detected mass forms part of a comoving molecular cloud complex that is physically associated with the expanding shell. The cloud internal velocity dispersions, degree of virialization and size-linewidth relations are found to be consistent with those of other Galactic samples. However, the vertical distribution is heavily skewed towards high-altitudes. The robust association of high-z molecular clouds with a known supershell provides some observational backing for the theory that expanding shells contribute to the support of a high-altitude molecular layer. 
0808.03851	Repeatable quantum memory channels	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Tomas Rybar, Mário Ziman	Abstract:  Within the framework of quantum memory channels we introduce the notion of repeatability of quantum channels. In particular, a quantum channel is called repeatable if there exist a memory device implementing the same channel on each individual input. We show that random unitary channels can be implemented in a repeatable fashion, whereas the nonunital channels cannot. 
0808.03852	Gibbs Sampling, Exponential Families and Orthogonal Polynomials	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:Persi Diaconis, Kshitij Khare, Laurent Saloff-Coste	Abstract:  We give families of examples where sharp rates of convergence to stationarity of the widely used Gibbs sampler are available. The examples involve standard exponential families and their conjugate priors. In each case, the transition operator is explicitly diagonalizable with classical orthogonal polynomials as eigenfunctions. 
0808.03853	Macroscopic models of local field potentials and the apparent 1/f noise in brain activity	Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)	Authors:Claude Bedard, Alain Destexhe	Abstract:  The power spectrum of local field potentials (LFPs) has been reported to scale as the inverse of the frequency, but the origin of this "1/f noise" is at present unclear. Macroscopic measurements in cortical tissue demonstrated that electric conductivity (as well as permittivity) is frequency dependent, while other measurements failed to evidence any dependence on frequency. In the present paper, we propose a model of the genesis of LFPs which accounts for the above data and contradictions. Starting from first principles (Maxwell equations), we introduce a macroscopic formalism in which macroscopic measurements are naturally incorporated, and also examine different physical causes for the frequency dependence. We suggest that ionic diffusion primes over electric field effects, and is responsible for the frequency dependence. This explains the contradictory observations, and also reproduces the 1/f power spectral structure of LFPs, as well as more complex frequency scaling. Finally, we suggest a measurement method to reveal the frequency dependence of current propagation in biological tissue, and which could be used to directly test the predictions of the present formalism. 
0808.03854	Noise driven unlimited population growth	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:Baruch Meerson, Pavel V. Sasorov	Abstract:  Demographic noise causes unlimited population growth in a broad class of models which, without noise, would predict a stable finite population. We study this effect on the example of a stochastic birth-death model which includes immigration, binary reproduction and death. The unlimited population growth proceeds as an exponentially slow decay of a metastable probability distribution (MPD) of the population. We develop a systematic WKB theory, complemented by the van Kampen system size expansion, for the MPD and for the decay time. Important signatures of the MPD is a power-law tail (such that all the distribution moments, except the zeroth one, diverge) and the presence in the solution of two different WKB modes.

0808.03857	Covariate Balance in Simple, Stratified and Clustered Comparative Studies	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:Ben B. Hansen, Jake Bowers	Abstract:  In randomized experiments, treatment and control groups should be roughly the same--balanced--in their distributions of pretreatment variables. But how nearly so? Can descriptive comparisons meaningfully be paired with significance tests? If so, should there be several such tests, one for each pretreatment variable, or should there be a single, omnibus test? Could such a test be engineered to give easily computed $p$-values that are reliable in samples of moderate size, or would simulation be needed for reliable calibration? What new concerns are introduced by random assignment of clusters? Which tests of balance would be optimal? To address these questions, Fisher's randomization inference is applied to the question of balance. Its application suggests the reversal of published conclusions about two studies, one clinical and the other a field experiment in political participation. 
0808.03858	Hyperbolic Deformation on Quantum Lattice Hamiltonians	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Hiroshi Ueda, Tomotoshi Nishino	Abstract:  A group of non-uniform quantum lattice Hamiltonians in one dimension is introduced, which is related to the hyperbolic $1 + 1$-dimensional space. The Hamiltonians contain only nearest neighbor interactions whose strength is proportional to $\cosh j λ$, where $j$ is the lattice index and where $λ\ge 0$ is a deformation parameter. In the limit $λ\to 0$ the Hamiltonians become uniform. Spacial translation of the deformed Hamiltonians is induced by the corner Hamiltonians. As a simple example, we investigate the ground state of the deformed $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg spin chain by use of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. It is shown that the ground state is dimerized when $λ$ is finite. Spin correlation function show exponential decay, and the boundary effect decreases with increasing $λ$.

0808.03860	Non-additive properties of finite 1D Ising chains with long-range interactions	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:S. S. Apostolov, Z. A. Mayzelis, O. V. Usatenko, V. A. Yampol'skii	Abstract:  We study the statistical properties of Ising spin chains with finite (although arbitrary large) range of interaction between the elements. We examine mesoscopic subsystems (fragments of an Ising chain) with the lengths comparable with the interaction range. The equivalence of the Ising chains and the multi-step Markov sequences is used for calculating different non-additive statistical quantities of a chain and its fragments. In particular, we study the variance of fluctuating magnetization of fragments, magnetization of the chain in the external magnetic field, etc. Asymptotical expressions for the non-additive energy and entropy of the mesoscopic fragments are derived in the limiting cases of weak and strong interactions.

0808.03862	Multipartite Entanglement and Global Information	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:C. Kruszynska, B. Kraus	Abstract:  We investigate the entanglement properties of pure quantum states describing $n$ qubits. We characterize all multipartite states which can be maximally entangled to local auxiliary systems using controlled operations. A state has this property iff one can construct out of it an orthonormal basis by applying independent local unitary operations. This implies that those states can be used to encode locally the maximum amount of $n$ bits. Examples of these states are the so--called stabilizer states, which are used for quantum error correction and one--way quantum computing. We give a simple characterization of these states and construct a complete set of commuting unitary observables which characterize the state uniquely. Furthermore we show how these states can be prepared and discuss their applications. 
0808.03863	Parallel in Time Simulation of Multiscale Stochastic Chemical Kinetics	Numerical Analysis (math.NA)	Authors:Stefan Engblom	Abstract:  A version of the time-parallel algorithm parareal is analyzed and applied to stochastic models in chemical kinetics. A fast predictor at the macroscopic scale (evaluated in serial) is available in the form of the usual reaction rate equations. A stochastic simulation algorithm is used to obtain an exact realization of the process at the mesoscopic scale (in parallel). The underlying stochastic description is a jump process driven by the Poisson measure. A convergence result in this arguably difficult setting is established suggesting that a homogenization of the solution is advantageous. We devise a simple but highly general such technique. Three numerical experiments on models representative to the field of computational systems biology illustrate the method. For non-stiff problems, it is shown that the method is able to quickly converge even when stochastic effects are present. For stiff problems we are instead able to obtain fast convergence to a homogenized solution. Overall, the method builds an attractive bridge between on the one hand, macroscopic deterministic scales and, on the other hand, mesoscopic stochastic ones. This construction is clearly possible to apply also to stochastic models within other fields.

The main purpose of our paper was to give reasonably sharp rates of convergence for some simple examples of the Gibbs sampler. We chose examples from expository accounts where direct use of available techniques gave practically useless answers. Careful treatment of these simple examples grew into bivariate modeling and Lancaster families. Since bounding rates of convergence is our primary focus, let us begin there. [arXiv:0808.3852] 
0808.03865	Integrability of the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation with Feshbach Resonance management	Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)	Authors:Dun Zhao, Hua-Yue Chai, Hong-Gang Luo	Abstract:  In this paper we study the integrability of a class of Gross-Pitaevskii equations managed by Feshbach resonance in an expulsive parabolic external potential. By using WTC test, we find a condition under which the Gross-Pitaevskii equation is completely integrable. Under the present model, this integrability condition is completely consistent with that proposed by Serkin, Hasegawa, and Belyaeva [V. N. Serkin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 074102 (2007)]. Furthermore, this integrability can also be explicitly shown by a transformation, which can convert the Gross-Pitaevskii equation into the well-known standard nonlinear Schrödinger equation. By this transformation, each exact solution of the standard nonlinear Schrödinger equation can be converted into that of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which builds a systematical connection between the canonical solitons and the so-called nonautonomous ones. The finding of this transformation has a significant contribution to understanding the essential properties of the nonautonomous solitions and the dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensates by using the Feshbach resonance technique. 
0808.03866	O-minimal homotopy and generalized (co)homology	Logic (math.LO)	Authors:Artur Piȩkosz	Abstract:  This article explains and extends semialgebraic homotopy theory (developed by H. Delfs and M. Knebusch) to o-minimal homotopy theory (over a field). The homotopy category of definable CW-complexes is equivalent to the homotopy category of topological CW-complexes (with continuous mappings). If the theory of the o-minimal expansion of a field is bounded, then these categories are equivalent to the homotopy category of weakly definable spaces. Similar facts hold for decreasing systems of spaces. As a result, generalized homology and cohomology theories on pointed weak polytopes uniquely correspond (up to an isomorphism) to the known topological generalized homology and cohomology theories on pointed CW-complexes.

0808.03868	QED calculation of transition probabilities in two-electron ions	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:O. Yu. Andreev, L. N. Labzowsky, G. Plunien	Abstract:  Accurate QED calculation of transition probabilities for the low-lying two-electron configurations of multicharged ions is presented. The calculation is performed for the nondegenerate states $(1s2s) 3S1$, $(1s2p_{3/2}) 3P2$ ($M 1$ and $M 2$ transitions, respectively) and for the quasidegenerate states $(1s2p) 1P1$, $(1s2p) 3P1$ ($E 1$ transitions) decaying to the ground state $(1s1s) 1S0$. Two-electron ions with nuclear charge numbers $Z=10-92$ are considered. The line profile approach is employed for the description of the process in multicharged ions within the framework of QED. 
0808.03869	Ground states of 2d +-J Ising spin glasses via stationary Fokker-Planck sampling	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:O. Melchert, A. K. Hartmann	Abstract:  We investigate the performance of the recently proposed stationary Fokker-Planck sampling method considering a combinatorial optimization problem from statistical physics. The algorithmic procedure relies upon the numerical solution of a linear second order differential equation that depends on a diffusion-like parameter D. We apply it to the problem of finding ground states of 2d Ising spin glasses for the +-J-Model. We consider square lattices with side length up to L=24 with two different types of boundary conditions and compare the results to those obtained by exact methods. A particular value of D is found that yields an optimal performance of the algorithm. We compare this optimal value of D to a percolation transition, which occurs when studying the connected clusters of spins flipped by the algorithm. Nevertheless, even for moderate lattice sizes, the algorithm has more and more problems to find the exact ground states. This means that the approach, at least in its standard form, seems to be inferior to other approaches like parallel tempering. 
0808.03870	Logic Integer Programming Models for Signaling Networks	Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)	Authors:Utz-Uwe Haus (1), Kathrin Niermann (1), Klaus Truemper (2), Robert Weismantel (1) ((1) Magdeburg, Germany, (2) Dallas, Texas)    	Abstract:  We propose a static and a dynamic approach to model biological signaling networks, and show how each can be used to answer relevant biological questions. For this we use the two different mathematical tools of Propositional Logic and Integer Programming. The power of discrete mathematics for handling qualitative as well as quantitative data has so far not been exploited in Molecular Biology, which is mostly driven by experimental research, relying on first-order or statistical models. The arising logic statements and integer programs are analyzed and can be solved with standard software. For a restricted class of problems the logic models reduce to a polynomial-time solvable satisfiability algorithm. Additionally, a more dynamic model enables enumeration of possible time resolutions in poly-logarithmic time. Computational experiments are included. 
0808.03871	Effects of Zn and Ni substitution on the Cu-spin dynamics and superconductivity in La_2-x_Sr_x_Cu_1-y_(Zn,Ni)_y_O_4_ with x=0.15-0.20 studied by the muon spin relaxation and magnetic susceptibility	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:T. Adachi, N. Oki, Risdiana, S. Yairi, Y. Koike, I. Watanabe	Abstract:  We have investigated effects of Zn and Ni on the Cu-spin dynamics and superconductivity from the zero-field muon-spin-relaxation (ZF-muSR) and magnetic-susceptibility, chi, measurements for La_2-x_Sr_x_Cu_1-y_(Zn,Ni)_y_O_4_ with x=0.15-0.20, changing y up to 0.10 in fine step. In the optimally doped x=0.15, it has been concluded that the formation of a magnetic order requires a larger amount of Ni than that of Zn, which is similar to our previous results of x=0.13. From the estimation of volume fractions of superconducting (SC) and magnetic regions, it has been found for x=0.15 that the SC region is in rough correspondence to the region where Cu spins fluctuate fast beyond the muSR frequency window for both Zn- and Ni-substituted samples. According to the stripe model, it follows that, even for x=0.15, the dynamical stripe correlations of spins and holes are pinned and localized around Zn and Ni, leading to the formation of the static stripe order and the suppression of superconductivity. These may indicate an importance of the dynamical stripe in the appearance of the high-T_c_ superconductivity in the hole-doped cuprates. In the overdoped regime of x=0.18 and 0.20, on the other hand, the SC region seems to be in rough correspondence to the region where Cu spins fluctuate fast beyond the muSR frequency window, though it appears that the Cu-spin dynamics and superconductivity are affected by the phase separation into SC and normal-state regions. 
0808.03872	Salt-specific stability and denaturation of a short salt-bridge forming alpha-helix	Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)	Authors:Joachim Dzubiella	Abstract:  The structure of a single alanine-based Ace-AEAAAKEAAAKA-Nme peptide in explicit aqueous electrolyte solutions (NaCl, KCl, NaI, and KF) at large salt concentrations (3-4 M) is investigated using 1 microsecond molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations. The peptide displays 71 alpha-helical structure without salt and destabilizes with the addition of NaCl in agreement with experiments of a somewhat longer version. It is mainly stabilized by direct and indirect (i+4)EK salt bridges between the Lys and Glu side chains and a concomitant backbone shielding mechanism. NaI is found to be a stronger denaturant than NaCl, while the potassium salts hardly show influence. Investigation of the molecular structures reveals that consistent with recent experiments Na+ has a much stronger affinity to side chain carboxylates and backbone carbonyls than K+, thereby weakening salt bridges and secondary structure hydrogen bonds. At the same time the large I- has a considerable affinity to the nonpolar alanine in line with recent observations of a large propensity of I- to adsorb to simple hydrophobes, and thereby 'assists' Na+ in its destabilizing action. In the denatured states of the peptide novel long-lived (10-20 ns) 'loop'-configurations are observed in which single Na+ ions and water molecules are hydrogen-bonded to multiple backbone carbonyls. In an attempt to analyze the denaturation behavior within the preferential interaction formalism, we find indeed that for the strongest denaturant, NaI, the protein is least hydrated. Additionally, a possible indication for protein denaturation might be a preferential solvation of the first solvation shell of the peptide backbone by the destabilizing cosolute (sodium). 
0808.03873	Notes on the UK Non-Native Organism Risk Assessment Scheme	Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)	Authors:Gareth Hughes	Abstract:  In 2004, the UK Government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs commissioned research with the aim of developing a scheme for assessing the risks posed to species, habitats and ecosystems in the UK by non-native organisms. The outcome was the UK Non-Native Organism Risk Assessment Scheme. Unfortunately, the mathematical basis of the procedure for summarising risks deployed in the Risk Assessment Scheme, as outlined in Baker et al. (2008) and described in more detail in the Risk Assessment Scheme's User Manual, contains several analytical errors. These errors are outlined in the notes that follow. 
0808.03874	Delocalization-Localization Transition due to Anharmonicity	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:D. Hajnal, R. Schilling	Abstract:  Analytical and numerical calculations for a reduced Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain demonstrate that energy localization does not require more than one conserved quantity. Clear evidence for the existence of a sharp delocalization-localization transition at a critical amplitude is given. Approaching the critical amplitude from above and below, diverging time scales occur. Above the critical amplitude, the energy packet converges towards a discrete breather. Nevertheless, ballistic energy transportation is present, demonstrating that its existence does not necessarily imply delocalization.

In the rational limit it coincides with a Poisson bracket found by Arutyunov and Frolov. 
0808.03876	A purely dipolar quantum gas	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:T. Lahaye, J. Metz, T. Koch, B. Fröhlich, A. Griesmaier, T. Pfau	Abstract:  We report on experiments exploring the physics of dipolar quantum gases using a Chromium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). By means of a Feshbach resonance, it is possible to reduce the effects of short range interactions and reach a regime where the physics is governed by the long-range, anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction between the large ($6 μ_{\rm B}$) magnetic moments of Chromium atoms. Several dramatic effects of the dipolar interaction are observed: the usual inversion of ellipticity of the condensate during time-of flight is inhibited, the stability of the dipolar gas depends strongly on the trap geometry, and the explosion following the collapse of an unstable dipolar condensate displays d-wave like features.

In this note we show that in many cases V can be embedded as a principal Zariski open subset into a hypersurface of a weighted projective space. In particular, we recover a result of D. Daigle and P. Russell. 
0808.03878	Measuring Outer Disk Warps with Optical Spectroscopy	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Daniel Christlein, Joss Bland-Hawthorn	Abstract:  Warps in the outer gaseous disks of galaxies are a ubiquitous phenomenon, but it is unclear what generates them. One theory is that warps are generated internally through spontaneous bending instabilities. Other theories suggest that they result from the interaction of the outer disk with accreting extragalactic material. In this case, we expect to find cases where the circular velocity of the warp gas is poorly correlated with the rotational velocity of the galaxy disk at the same radius. Optical spectroscopy presents itself as an interesting alternative to 21-cm observations for testing this prediction, because (i) separating the kinematics of the warp from those of the disk requires a spatial resolution that is higher than what is achieved at 21 cm at low HI column density; (ii) optical spectroscopy also provides important information on star formation rates, gas excitation, and chemical abundances, which provide clues to the origin of the gas in warps. We present here preliminary results of a study of the kinematics of gas in the outer-disk warps of seven edge-on galaxies, using multi-hour VLT/FORS2 spectroscopy. 
0808.03879	Higher Rank Wavelets	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Sean Olphert, Stephen C. Power	Abstract:  A theory of higher rank multiresolution analysis is given in the setting of abelian multiscalings. This theory enables the construction, from a higher rank MRA, of finite wavelet sets whose multidilations have translates forming an orthonormal basis in $L^2(\bR^d)$. While tensor products of uniscaled MRAs provide simple examples we construct many nonseparable higher rank wavelets. In particular we construct Latin square wavelets as rank 2 variants of Haar wavelets. Also we construct nonseparable scaling functions for rank 2 variants of Meyer wavelet scaling functions, and we construct the associated nonseparable wavelets with compactly supported Fourier transforms. On the other hand we show that compactly supported scaling functions for biscaled MRAs are necessarily separable. 
0808.03880	The security of Ping-Pong protocol	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Jian-Chuan Tan, An Min Wang	Abstract:  Ping-Pong protocol is a type of quantum key distribution which makes use of two entangled photons in the EPR state. Its security is based on the randomization of the operations that Alice performs on the travel photon (qubit), and on the anti-correlation between the two photons in the EPR state. In this paper, we study the security of this protocol against some known quantum attacks, and present a scheme that may enhance its security to some degree. 
0808.03881	Counting Hexagonal Patches and Independent Sets in Circle Graphs	Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)	Authors:Paul Bonsma, Felix Breuer	Abstract:  A hexagonal patch is a plane graph in which inner faces have length 6, inner vertices have degree 3, and boundary vertices have degree 2 or 3. We consider the following counting problem: given a sequence of twos and threes, how many hexagonal patches exist with this degree sequence along the outer face? This problem is motivated by the study of benzenoid hydrocarbons and fullerenes in computational chemistry. We give the first polynomial time algorithm for this problem. We show that it can be reduced to counting maximum independent sets in circle graphs, and give a simple and fast algorithm for this problem. 
0808.03882	A chain morphism for Adams operations on rational algebraic K-theory	K-Theory and Homology (math.KT)	Authors:Elisenda Feliu	Abstract:  For any regular noetherian scheme X and every k>0, we define a chain morphism between two chain complexes whose homology with rational coefficients is isomorphic to the algebraic K-groups of X tensored by the field of rational numbers. It is shown that these morphisms induce in homology the Adams operations defined by Gillet and Soule or the ones defined by Grayson. 
0808.03883	Stars and gas in the Medusa merger	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:E. Manthey (1,2), S. Huettemeister (2), S. Aalto (3), C. Horellou (3), P. Bjerkeli (3) ((1) Astron, Netherlands, (2) AIRUB, Germany, (3) OSO, Sweden)    	Abstract:  The Medusa (NGC 4194) is a well-studied nearby galaxy with the disturbed appearance of a merger and evidence for ongoing star formation. In order to test whether it could be the result of an interaction between a gas-rich disk-like galaxy and a larger elliptical, we have carried out optical and radio observations of the stars and the gas in the Medusa, and performed $N$-body numerical simulations of the evolution of such a system. We used the Nordic Optical Telescope to obtain a deep V-band image and the Westerbork Radio Synthesis Telescope to map the large-scale distribution and kinematics of atomic hydrogen. A single HI tail was found to the South of the Medusa with a projected length of 56 kpc (5') and a gas mass of 7* 10^8 M_sun, thus harbouring about one third of the total HI mass of the system. HI was also detected in absorption toward the continuum in the center. HI was detected in a small nearby galaxy to the North-West of the Medusa at a projected distance of 91 kpc. It is, however, unlikely that this galaxy has had a significant influence on the evolution of the Medusa. The simulations of the slightly prograde infall of a gas-rich disk galaxy on an larger, four time more massive elliptical (spherical) galaxy reproduce most of the observed features of the Medusa.Thus, the Medusa is an ideal object to study the merger-induced star formation contribution from the small galaxy of a minor merger. 
0808.03884	The Complexity of Reasoning for Fragments of Default Logic	Computational Complexity (cs.CC)	Authors:Olaf Beyersdorff, Arne Meier, Michael Thomas, Heribert Vollmer	Abstract:  Default logic was introduced by Reiter in 1980. In 1992, Gottlob classified the complexity of the extension existence problem for propositional default logic as $\SigmaPtwo$-complete, and the complexity of the credulous and skeptical reasoning problem as SigmaP2-complete, resp. PiP2-complete. Additionally, he investigated restrictions on the default rules, i.e., semi-normal default rules. Selman made in 1992 a similar approach with disjunction-free and unary default rules. In this paper we systematically restrict the set of allowed propositional connectives. We give a complete complexity classification for all sets of Boolean functions in the meaning of Post's lattice for all three common decision problems for propositional default logic. We show that the complexity is a hexachotomy (SigmaP2-, DeltaP2-, NP-, P-, NL-complete, trivial) for the extension existence problem, while for the credulous and skeptical reasoning problem we obtain similar classifications without trivial cases. 
0808.03885	Fractionally Quantized Cooper Pair Stair Case in Superconducting Quantum Dots	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Sujit Sarkar	Abstract:  We study clean superconducting quantum dots (SQD) and also site dependent Josephson couplings, on site charging energies and the intersite interactions in presence of gate voltage. We predict the existence of different fractionally quantized Cooper pair stair case with many interesting physical properties. The appearance of stair case is not only due to the Coulomb blocked phenomena but also for the site dependent Josephson couplings. We also explain physically the absence of other fractionally quantized Cooper pair stair case. The physics of fractionally quantized Cooper pair stair case has close resemblance with the fractionally quantized magnetization plateau of a spin chain system under a magnetic field. 
0808.03886	Stress dependent thermal pressurization of a fluid-saturated rock	Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)	Authors:Siavash Ghabezloo (ENPC-Cermes), Jean Sulem (ENPC-Cermes)    	Abstract:  Temperature increase in saturated porous materials under undrained conditions leads to thermal pressurization of the pore fluid due to the discrepancy between the thermal expansion coefficients of the pore fluid and of the solid matrix. This increase in the pore fluid pressure induces a reduction of the effective mean stress and can lead to shear failure or hydraulic fracturing. The equations governing the phenomenon of thermal pressurization are presented and this phenomenon is studied experimentally for a saturated granular rock in an undrained heating test under constant isotropic stress. Careful analysis of the effect of mechanical and thermal deformation of the drainage and pressure measurement system is performed and a correction of the measured pore pressure is introduced. The test results are modelled using a non-linear thermo-poro-elastic constitutive model of the granular rock with emphasis on the stress-dependent character of the rock compressibility. The effects of stress and temperature on thermal pressurization observed in the tests are correctly reproduced by the model. 
0808.03887	The Multiwavelength Picture of Star Formation in the Very Young Open Cluster NGC6383	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Gregor Rauw, Michaël De Becker	Abstract:  We review the properties of the very young (2 Myr) open cluster NGC6383. The cluster is dominated by the massive binary HD159176 (O7V + O7V). The distance to NGC6383 is consistently found to be 1.3 +- 0.1 kpc and the average reddening is determined to be E(B-V) = 0.32 +- 0.02. Several pre-main sequence candidates have been identified using different criteria relying on the detection of emission lines, infrared excesses, photometric variability and X-ray emission. 
0808.03888	New Model System for a One-Dimensional Electron Liquid: Self-Organized Atomic Gold Chains on Ge(001)	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:J. Schaefer, C. Blumenstein, S. Meyer, M. Wisniewski, R. Claessen (Department of Physics, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany)    	Abstract:  Unique electronic properties of self-organized Au atom chains on Ge(001) in novel c(8x2) long-range order are revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy. Along the nanowires an exceptionally narrow conduction path exists which is virtually decoupled from the substrate. It is laterally confined to the ultimate limit of single atom dimension, and is strictly separated from its neighbors, as not previously reported. The resulting tunneling conductivity shows a dramatic inhomogeneity of two orders of magnitude. The atom chains thus represent an outstandingly close approach to a one-dimensional electron liquid. 
0808.03889	Open architecture for multilingual parallel texts	Computation and Language (cs.CL)	Authors:M.T. Carrasco Benitez	Abstract:  Multilingual parallel texts (abbreviated to parallel texts) are linguistic versions of the same content ("translations"); e.g., the Maastricht Treaty in English and Spanish are parallel texts. This document is about creating an open architecture for the whole Authoring, Translation and Publishing Chain (ATP-chain) for the processing of parallel texts. 
0808.03890	A deep look into the cores of young clusters I. sigma-Orionis	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:H. Bouy, N. Huelamo, E. L. Martin, F. Marchis, D. Barrado y Navascues, J. Kolb, E. Marchetti, M. G. Petr-Gotzens, M. Sterzik, V. D. Ivanov, R. Koehler, D. Nuernberger	Abstract:  Nearby young clusters are privileged places to study the star formation history. Over the last decade, the sigma-Orionis cluster has been a prime location for the study of young very low mass stars, substellar and isolated planetary mass objects and the determination of the initial mass function. To extend previous studies of this association to its core, we searched for ultracool members and new multiple systems within the 1.5'x1.5' central region of the cluster. We obtained deep multi-conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) images of the core of the sigma-Orionis cluster with the prototype MCAO facility MAD at the VLT using the H and Ks filters. These images allow us to reach Delta H~5mag as close as 0.2" on a typical source with H=14.5mag. These images were complemented by archival SofI Ks-band images and Spitzer IRAC and MIPS mid-infrared images. We report the detection of 2 new visual multiple systems, one being a candidate binary proplyd and the other one a low mass companion to the massive star sigma Ori E. Of the 36 sources detected in the images, 25 have a H-band luminosity lower than the expected planetary mass limit for members, and H-Ks color consistent with the latest theoretical isochrones. Nine objects have additional Spitzer photometry and spectral energy distribution consistent with them being cluster members. One of them has a spectral energy distribution from H to 3.6micron consistent with that of a 5.5 MJup cluster member. Complementary NTT/SofI and Spitzer photometry allow us to confirm the nature and membership of two L-dwarf planetary mass candidates. 
0808.03891	Coupled two-component atomic gas in an optical lattice	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Jonas Larson, Jani-Petri Martikainen	Abstract:  We present an ab initio study of the ground state of an ideal coupled two-component gas of ultracold atoms in a one dimensional optical lattice, either bosons or fermions. Due to the internal two-level structure of the atoms, the Brillouin zone is twice as large as imposed by the periodicity of the lattice potential. This is reflected in the Bloch dispersion curves, where the energy bands regularly possess several local minima. As a consequence, when the system parameters are tuned across a resonance condition, a non-zero temperature phase transition occurs which arises from an interplay between internal and kinetic atomic energies. For fermions, this phase transition is of topological character since the structure of the Fermi surface is changed across the critical value. It is shown that these phenomena are also expected to occur for two and three dimensional optical lattices. 
0808.03892	Essential arity gap of Boolean functions	Discrete Mathematics (cs.DM)	Authors:Slavcho Shtrakov	Abstract:  We investigate the Boolean functions with essential arity gap 2. We use Full Conjunctive Normal Forms instead of Zhegalkin's polynomials, which allow us to simplify the proofs and to obtain several combinatorial results, concerning the Boolean functions with a given arity gap. 
0808.03893	Quasi-analytische Zerlegungen	Complex Variables (math.CV)	Authors:Burchard Kaup, Hans-Jörg Reiffen	Abstract:  The leaves in singular holomorphic foliation theory are examples of quasi-analytic layers. In the first part of our publication we are concerned with a theory of these subjects. A quasi-analytic decomposition of a complex manifold is a decomposition into pairwise disjoint connected quasi-analytic layers. These are holomorphic foliations in the sense of P. Stefan and K. Spallek. A very different but more usual conception of holomorphic foliations is develloped by P. Baum and R. Bott. It is based on holomorphic sheaf theory. In the second part we study the relation between quasi-analytic decompositions and singular holomorphic foliations in the sense of Baum and Bott. 
0808.03894	Influence of Disorder Strength on Phase Field Models of Interfacial Growth	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:T. Laurila, M. Pradas, A. Hernandez-Machado, T. Ala-Nissila	Abstract:  We study the influence of disorder strength on the interface roughening process in a phase-field model with locally conserved dynamics. We consider two cases where the mobility coefficient multiplying the locally conserved current is either constant throughout the system (the two-sided model) or becomes zero in the phase into which the interface advances (one-sided model). In the limit of weak disorder, both models are completely equivalent and can reproduce the physical process of a fluid diffusively invading a porous media, where super-rough scaling of the interface fluctuations occurs. On the other hand, increasing disorder causes the scaling properties to change to intrinsic anomalous scaling. In the limit of strong disorder this behavior prevails for the one-sided model, whereas for the two-sided case, nucleation of domains in front of the invading front are observed. 
0808.03895	Kinematics of the H2O masers at the centre of the PN K3-35	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:L. Uscanga, Y. Gómez, A. C. Raga, J. Cantó, G. Anglada, J. F. Gómez, J. M. Torrelles, L. F. Miranda	Abstract:  We have studied the kinematics traced by the water masers located at the centre of the planetary nebula (PN) K3-35, using data from previous Very Large Array (VLA) observations. An analysis of the spatial distribution and line-of-sight velocities of the maser spots allows us to identify typical patterns of a rotating and expanding ring in the position-velocity diagrams, according to our kinematical model. We find that the distribution of the masers is compatible with tracing a circular ring with a ~0.021 arcsec (~100 AU) radius, observed with an inclination angle with respect to the line of sight of 55 degrees. We derive expansion and rotation velocities of 1.4 and 3.1 km/s, respectively. The orientation of the ring projected on the plane of the sky, at PA 158 degrees, is almost orthogonal to the direction of the innermost region of the jet observed in K3-35, suggesting the presence of a disc or torus that may be related to the collimation of the outflow. 
0808.03896	Experimental manifestation of the breakpoint region in the current-voltage characteristics of intrinsic Josephson junctions	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:A.Irie, Yu.M.Shukrinov, G.Oya	Abstract:  The experimental evidence of the breakpoint on the current-voltage characteristics (IVCs) of the stacks of intrinsic Josephson junctions (IJJs) is presented. The influence of the capacitive coupling on the IVCs of Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_y$ IJJs has been investigated. At 4.2 K, clear breakpoint region is observed on the branches in the IVCs. It is found that the hysteresis observed on the IVC is suppressed due to the coupling compared with that expected from the McCumber parameter. Measurements agree well with the results obtained by the theoretical model. 
0808.03897	New composite models of partially ionized protoplanetary disks	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Caroline E. J. M. L. J. Terquem	Abstract:  We study an accretion disk in which three different regions may coexist: MHD turbulent regions, dead zones and gravitationally unstable regions. Although the dead zones are stable, there is some transport due to the Reynolds stress associated with waves emitted from the turbulent layers. We model the transport in each of the different regions by its own $α$ parameter, this being 10 to $10^{3}$ times smaller in dead zones than in active layers. In gravitationally unstable regions, $α$ is determined by the fact that the disk self-adjusts to a state of marginal stability. We construct steady-state models of such disks. We find that for uniform mass flow, the disk has to be more massive, hotter and thicker at the radii where there is a dead zone. In disks in which the dead zone is very massive, gravitational instabilities are present. Whether such models are realistic or not depends on whether hydrodynamical fluctuations driven by the turbulent layers can penetrate all the way inside the dead zone. This may be more easily achieved when the ratio of the mass of the active layer to that of the dead zone is relatively large, which in our models corresponds to $α$ in the dead zone being about 10% of $α$ in the active layers. If the disk is at some stage of its evolution not in steady-state, then the surface density will evolve toward the steady-state solution. However, if $α$ in the dead zone is much smaller than in the active zone, the timescale for the parts of the disk beyond a few AU to reach steady-state may become longer than the disk lifetime. Steady-state disks with dead zones are a more favorable environment for planet formation than standard disks, since the dead zone is typically 10 times more massive than a corresponding turbulent zone at the same location. 
0808.03898	Nature and Nurture in Dark Matter Halos	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:R. N. Henriksen	Abstract:  Cosmological simulations consistently predict specific properties of dark matter halos, but these have not yet led to a physical understanding that is generally accepted. This is especially true for the central regions of these structures. Recently two major themes have emerged. In one, the dark matter halo is primarily a result of the sequential accretion of primordial structure (ie `Nature'); while in the other, dynamical relaxation (ie `Nurture') dominates at least in the central regions. Some relaxation is however required in either mechanism. In this paper we accept the recently established scale-free sub-structure of halos as an essential part of both mechanisms. Consequently; a simple model for the central relaxation based on a self-similar cascade of tidal interactions, is contrasted with a model based on the accretion of adiabatically self-similar, primordial structure. We conclude that a weak form of this relaxation is present in the simulations, but that is normally described as the radial orbit instability. 
0808.03899	Critiquing Variational Theories of the Anderson-Hubbard Model: Real-Space Self-Consistent Hartree-Fock Solutions	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:X. Chen, A. Farhoodfar, T. McIntosh, R. J. Gooding, P.W. Leung	Abstract:  A simple and commonly employed approximate technique with which one can examine spatially disordered systems when strong electronic correlations are present is based on the use of real-space unrestricted self-consistent Hartree-Fock wave functions. In such an approach the disorder is treated exactly while the correlations are treated approximately. In this report we critique the success of this approximation by making comparisons between such solutions and the exact wave functions for the Anderson-Hubbard model. Due to the sizes of the complete Hilbert spaces for these problems, the comparisons are restricted to small one-dimensional chains, up to ten sites, and a 4x4 two-dimensional cluster, and at 1/2 filling these Hilbert spaces contain about 63,500 and 166 million states, respectively. We have completed these calculations both at and away from 1/2 filling. This approximation is based on a variational approach which minimizes the Hartree-Fock energy, and we have completed comparisons of the exact and Hartree-Fock energies. However, in order to assess the success of this approximation in reproducing ground-state correlations we have completed comparisons of the local charge and spin correlations, including the calculation of the overlap of the Hartree-Fock wave functions with those of the exact solutions. We find that this approximation reproduces the local charge densities to quite a high accuracy, but that the local spin correlations, as represented by < S_i . S_j >, are not as well represented. In addition to these comparisons, we discuss the properties of the spin degrees of freedom in the HF approximation, and where in the disorder-interaction phase diagram such physics may be important. 
0808.03900	Giant magnetic anisotropy of the bulk antiferromagnets IrMn and IrMn3	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:L. Szunyogh, B. Lazarovits, L. Udvardi, J. Jackson, U. Nowak	Abstract:  Theoretical predictions of the magnetic anisotropy of antiferromagnetic materials are demanding due to a lack of experimental techniques which are capable of a direct measurement of this quantity. At the same time it is highly significant due to the use of antiferromagnetic components in magneto-resistive sensor devices where the stability of the antiferromagnet is of upmost relevance. We perform an ab-initio study of the ordered phases of IrMn and IrMn3, the most widely used industrial antiferromagnets. Calculating the form and the strength of the magnetic anisotropy allows the construction of an effective spin model, which is tested against experimental measurements regarding the magnetic ground state and the Neel temperature. Our most important result is the extremely strong second order anisotropy for IrMn3 appearing in its frustrated triangular magnetic ground state, a surprising fact since the ordered L12 phase has a cubic symmetry. We explain this large anisotropy by the fact that cubic symmetry is locally broken for each of the three Mn sub-lattices. 
0808.03901	Consistency of ground state and spectroscopic measurements on flux qubits	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:A. Izmalkov, S.H.W. van der Ploeg, S.N. Shevchenko, M. Grajcar, E. Il'ichev, U. Hübner, A.N. Omelyanchouk, H.-G. Meyer	Abstract:  We compare the results of ground state and spectroscopic measurements carried out on superconducting flux qubits which are effective two-level quantum systems. For a single qubit and for two coupled qubits we show excellent agreement between the parameters of the pseudospin Hamiltonian found using both methods. We argue, that by making use of the ground state measurements the Hamiltonian of N coupled flux qubits can be reconstructed as well at temperatures smaller than the energy level separation. Such a reconstruction of a many-qubit Hamiltonian can be useful for future quantum information processing devices. 
0808.03902	A lower bound on the mass of Dark Matter particles	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Alexey Boyarsky, Oleg Ruchayskiy, Dmytro Iakubovskyi	Abstract:  We discuss the bounds on the mass of Dark Matter (DM) particles, coming from the analysis of DM phase-space distribution in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). After reviewing the existing approaches, we choose two methods to derive such a bound. The first one depends on the information about the current phase space distribution of DM particles only, while the second one uses both the initial and final distributions. We discuss the recent data on dSphs as well as astronomical uncertainties in relevant parameters. As an application, we present lower bounds on the mass of DM particles, coming from various dSphs, using both methods. The model-independent bound holds for any type of fermionic DM. Stronger, model-dependent bounds are quoted for several DM models (thermal relics, non-resonantly and resonantly produced sterile neutrinos, etc.). The latter bounds rely on the assumption that baryonic feedback cannot significantly increase the maximum of a distribution function of DM particles. For the scenario in which all the DM is made of sterile neutrinos produced via non-resonant mixing with the active neutrinos (NRP) this gives m_nrp > 1.7 keV. Combining these results in their most conservative form with the X-ray bounds of DM decay lines, we conclude that the NRP scenario remains allowed in a very narrow parameter window only. This conclusion is independent of the results of the Lyman-alpha analysis. The DM model in which sterile neutrinos are resonantly produced in the presence of lepton asymmetry remains viable. Within the minimal neutrino extension of the Standard Model (the nuMSM), both mass and the mixing angle of the DM sterile neutrino are bounded from above and below, which suggests the possibility for its experimental search. 
0808.03903	Fermions and noncommutative theories	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Ricardo Amorim	Abstract:  By using a framework where the object of noncommutativity $θ^{μν}$ represents independent degrees of freedom, we study the symmetry properties of an extended $x+θ$ space-time, given by the group $P$', which has the Poincaré group $P$ as a subgroup. In this process we use the minimal canonical extension of the Doplicher, Fredenhagen and Roberts algebra. It is also proposed a generalized Dirac equation, where the fermionic field depends not only on the ordinary coordinates but on $θ^{μν}$ as well. The dynamical symmetry content of such fermionic theory is discussed, and we show that its action is invariant under $\cal P$'. 
0808.03904	Exploring the Nuclear Environment of the NLS1 Galaxy Arakelian 564 with XMM-Newton RGS	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:R.A.N. Smith, M.J. Page, G. Branduardi-Raymont	Abstract:  We present an accurate characterisation of the high-resolution X-ray spectrum of the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy Arakelian 564 and put it in to context with other objects of its type by making a detailed comparison of their spectra. The best fit to the data identifies five significant emission lines at 18.9, 22.1, 24.7, 29.0 and 33.5A due O VIII Ly alpha, O VII(f), N VII Ly alpha, N VI(i) and C VI Ly alpha respectively. These have an RMS velocity of ~1100km/s and a flow velocity of ~-600km/s, except for the O VII(f) emission line, which has a flow velocity consistent with zero. Two separate emitting regions are identified. Three separate phases of photoionized, X-ray absorbing gas are included in the fit with ionization parameters log xi=-0.86, 0.87, 2.56 and column densities N_H=0.89, 2.41, 6.03*10^20cm^-2 respectively. All three phases show this to be an unusually low velocity outflow (-10pm100km/s) for a narrow line Seyfert 1. We present the hypothesis that the BLR is the source of the NLR and warm absorber, and examine optical and UV images from the XMM-Newton Optical Monitor to relate our findings to the characteristics of the host galaxy. 
0808.03905	Rebound Shock Breakouts of Exploding Massive Stars: A MHD Void Model	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Ren-Yu Hu, Yu-Qing Lou	Abstract:  With a self-similar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model of an exploding progenitor star and an outgoing rebound shock and with the thermal bremsstrahlung as the major radiation mechanism in X-ray bands, we reproduce the early X-ray light curve observed for the recent event of XRO 080109/SN 2008D association. The X-ray light curve consists of a fast rise, as the shock travels into the "visible layer" in the stellar envelope, and a subsequent power-law decay, as the plasma cools in a self-similar evolution. The observed spectral softening is naturally expected in our rebound MHD shock scenario. We propose to attribute the "non-thermal spectrum" observed to be a superposition of different thermal spectra produced at different layers of the stellar envelope. 
0808.03906	Developing of New Facets of Indirect Modeling in the Geosciences	Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)	Authors:Hamed Owladeghaffari, Hadi Shakeri, Mostafa Sharifzadeh	Abstract:  In this paper, we describe some applications of Self Organizing feature map Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (SONFIS) and Self Organizing feature map Rough Set (SORST) in analysis of permeability at a dam site and lost circulation in the drilling of three wells in Iran. Elicitation of the best rules on the information tables, exploration of the dominant structures on the behaviour of systems while they fall in to the balance of the second granulation level (rules) and highlighting of most effective attributes (parameters) on the selected systems, are some of the benefits of the proposed methods. In the other process, using complex networks (graphs) theory - as another method in not 1:1 modelling branch- mechanical behaviour of a rock joint has been investigated. Keywords: Information Granules; SONFIS; SORST; Complex Networks; Permeability; Lost Circulation; Mechanical Behavior of a Rock Joint 
0808.03907	Gravity, Twistors and the MHV Formalism	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Lionel Mason, David Skinner	Abstract:  We give a self-contained derivation of the MHV amplitudes for gravity and use the associated twistor generating function to define a twistor action for the MHV diagram approach to gravity. Starting from a background field calculation on a spacetime with anti self-dual curvature, we obtain a simple spacetime formula for the scattering of a single, positive helicity linearized graviton into one of negative helicity. Re-expressing our integral in terms of twistor data allows us to consider a spacetime that is asymptotic to a superposition of plane waves. Expanding these out perturbatively yields the gravitational MHV amplitudes of Berends, Giele & Kuijf. We go on to take the twistor generating function off-shell at the perturbative level. Combining this with a twistor action for the anti self-dual background, we obtain a twistor action for the MHV diagram approach to perturbative gravity. We finish by extending these results to supergravity, in particular N=4 and N=8. 
0808.03908	Grüneisen ratio at the Kondo breakdown quantum critical point	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:K.-S. Kim, A. Benlagra, C. Pépin	Abstract:  We show that the scenario of multi-scale Kondo breakdown quantum critical point (QCP) gives rise to a divergent Grüneisen ratio with an anomalous exponent 0.7. In particular, we fit the experimental data of $YbRh_{2}(Si_{0.95}Ge_{0.05})_{2}$ for specific heat, thermal expansion, and Grüneisen ratio based on our simple analytic expressions. A reasonable agreement between the experiment and theory is found for the temperature range between 0.4 K and 10 K. We discuss how the Grüneisen ratio is a key measurement to discriminate between the Kondo breakdown and spin-density wave theories. 
0808.03909	Light quark masses from QCD sum rules with minimal hadronic bias	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:C.A. Dominguez, N.F. Nasrallah, R. Röntsch K. Schilcher	Abstract:  The light quark masses are determined using a new QCD Finite Energy Sum Rule (FESR) in the pseudoscalar channel. This FESR involves an integration kernel designed to reduce considerably the contribution of the (unmeasured) hadronic resonance spectral functions. The QCD sector of the FESR includes perturbative QCD (PQCD) to five loop order, and the leading non-perturbative terms. In the hadronic sector the dominant contribution is from the pseudoscalar meson pole. Using Contour Improved Perturbation Theory (CIPT) the results for the quark masses at a scale of 2 GeV are $m_u(Q= 2 {GeV}) = 2.9 \pm 0.2 {MeV}$, $m_d(Q= 2 {GeV}) = 5.3 \pm 0.4 {MeV}$, and $m_s(Q= 2 {GeV}) = 102 \pm 8 {MeV}$, for $Λ= 381 \pm 16 {MeV}$, corresponding to $α_s(M_τ^2) = 0.344 \pm0.009$. In this framework the systematic uncertainty in the quark masses from the unmeasured hadronic resonance spectral function amounts to less than 2 - 3 %. The remaining uncertainties above arise from those in $Λ$, the unknown six-loop PQCD contribution, and the gluon condensate, which are all potentially subject to improvement. 
0808.03910	Constraining sterile neutrino dark matter by phase-space density observations	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:D. Gorbunov, A. Khmelnitsky, V. Rubakov	Abstract:  We apply phase-space density considerations to obtain lower bounds on the mass of sterile neutrino as dark matter candidate. The bounds are different for non-resonant production, resonant production in the presence of lepton asymmetry and production in decays of heavier particles. In the former case our bound is comparable to, but independent of the Lyman-alpha bound, and together with X-ray upper limit it disfavors non-resonantly produced sterile neutrino dark matter. An interesting feature of the latter case is that warm dark matter may be composed of heavy particles. 
0808.03911	Simulability and regularity of complex quantum systems	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Hannah Venzl, Andrew J. Daley, Florian Mintert, Andreas Buchleitner	Abstract:  We show that the transition from regular to chaotic spectral statistics in interacting many-body quantum systems has an unambiguous signature in the distribution of Schmidt coefficients dynamically generated from a generic initial state, and thus limits the efficiency of the t-DMRG algorithm. 
0808.03912	Excited heavy tetraquarks with hidden charm	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:D. Ebert, R. N. Faustov, V. O. Galkin	Abstract:  The masses of the excited heavy tetraquarks with hidden charm are calculated within the relativistic diquark-antidiquark picture. The dynamics of the light quark in a heavy-light diquark is treated completely relativistically. The diquark structure is taken into account by calculating the diquark-gluon form factor. New experimental data on charmonium-like states above open charm threshold are discussed. The obtained results indicate that X(3872), Y(4260), Y(4360), Z(4248), Z(4433) and Y(4660) could be tetraquark states with hidden charm. 
0808.03913	Ultrashort Focused Electromagnetic Pulses	Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)	Authors:Daniel an der Brügge, Alexander Pukhov	Abstract:  In this article we present a closed analytical description for few-cycle, focused electromagnetic pulses of arbitrary duration and carrier-envelope-phase (CEP). Because of the vectorial character of light, not all thinkable one-dimensional (1D) shapes for the transverse electric field or vector potential can be realized as finite energy three-dimensional (3D) structures. We cope with this problem by using a second potential, which is defined as a primitive to the vector potential. This allows to construct fully consistent 3D wave-packet solutions for the Maxwell equations, given a solution of the scalar wave equation. The wave equation is solved for ultrashort, Gaussian and related pulses in paraxial approximation. The solution is given in a closed and numerically convenient form, based on the complex error function. All results undergo thorough numerical testing, validating their correctness and accuracy. A reliable and accurate representation of few-cycle pulses is e.g. crucial for analytical and numerical theory of vacuum particle acceleration. 
0808.03914	Randomization Does Not Justify Logistic Regression	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:David A. Freedman	Abstract:  The logit model is often used to analyze experimental data. However, randomization does not justify the model, so the usual estimators can be inconsistent. A consistent estimator is proposed. Neyman's non-parametric setup is used as a benchmark. In this setup, each subject has two potential responses, one if treated and the other if untreated; only one of the two responses can be observed. Beside the mathematics, there are simulation results, a brief review of the literature, and some recommendations for practice.

0808.03916	Crash-testing the CAULDRON code for joint lensing and dynamics analysis of early-type galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Matteo Barnabe (1), Carlo Nipoti (2), Leon V. E. Koopmans (1), Simona Vegetti (1), Luca Ciotti (2) ((1) Kapteyn Astronomical Institute; (2) Bologna University)    	Abstract:  We apply the joint lensing and dynamics code for the analysis of early-type galaxies, CAULDRON, to a rotating N-body stellar system with dark matter halo which significantly violates the two major assumptions of the method, i.e. axial symmetry supported by a two-integral distribution function. The goal is to study how CAULDRON performs in an extreme case, and to determine which galaxy properties can still be robustly recovered. Three data sets, corresponding to orthogonal lines of sight, are generated from the N-body system and analysed with the identical procedure followed in the study of real lens galaxies, adopting an axisymmetric power-law total density distribution. We find that several global properties of the N-body system are recovered with remarkable accuracy, despite the fact that the adopted power-law model is too simple to account for the lack of symmetry of the true density distribution. In particular, the logarithmic slope of the total density distribution is robustly recovered to within less than 10 per cent (with the exception of the ill-constrained very inner regions), the inferred angle-averaged radial profile of the total mass closely follows the true distribution, and the dark matter fraction of the system (inside the effective radius) is correctly determined within ~ 10 per cent of the total mass. Unless the line of sight direction is almost parallel to the total angular momentum vector of the system, reliably recovered quantities also include the angular momentum, the V/sigma ratio, and the anisotropy parameter delta. We conclude that the CAULDRON code can be safely and effectively applied to real early-type lens galaxies, providing reliable information also for systems that depart significantly from the method's assumptions. 
0808.03917	Lithium depletion and the rotational history of exoplanet host stars	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jerome Bouvier (LAOG)    	Abstract:  Israelian et al. (2004) reported that exoplanet host stars are lithium depleted compared to solar-type stars without detected massive planets, a result recently confirmed by Gonzalez (2008). We investigate whether enhanced lithium depletion in exoplanet host stars may result from their rotational history. We have developed rotational evolution models for slow and fast solar-type rotators from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to the age of the Sun and compare them to the distribution of rotational periods observed for solar-type stars between 1 Myr and 5 Gyr. We show that slow rotators develop a high degree of differential rotation between the radiative core and the convective envelope, while fast rotators evolve with little core-envelope decoupling. We suggest that strong differential rotation at the base of the convective envelope is responsible for enhanced lithium depletion in slow rotators. We conclude that lithium-depleted exoplanet host stars were slow rotators on the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) and argue that slow rotation results from a long lasting star-disk interaction during the PMS. Altogether, this suggests that long-lived disks (> 5 Myr) may be a necessary condition for massive planet formation/migration. 
0808.03918	Population III.1 stars: formation, feedback and evolution of the IMF	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jonathan C. Tan (Dept. of Astronomy, University of Florida)    	Abstract:  I discuss current theoretical expectations of how primordial, Pop III.1 stars form. Lack of direct observational constraints makes this a challenging task. In particular predicting the mass of these stars requires solving a series of problems, which all affect, perhaps drastically, the final outcome. While there is general agreement on the initial conditions, H_2-cooled gas at the center of dark matter minihalos, the subsequent evolution is more uncertain. In particular, I describe the potential effects of dark matter annihilation heating, fragmentation within the minihalo, magnetic field amplification, and protostellar ionizing feedback. After these considerations, one expects that the first stars are massive >~100Msun, with dark matter annihilation heating having the potential to raise this scale by large factors. Higher accretion rates in later-forming minihalos may cause the Pop III.1 initial mass function to evolve to higher masses. 
0808.03919	Integrable models: from dynamical solutions to string theory	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Elcio Abdalla, Antonio Lima Santos	Abstract:  We review the status of integrable models from the point of view of their dynamics and integrability conditions. Some integrable models are discussed in detail. We comment on the use it is made of them in string theory. We also discuss the Bethe Ansatz solution of the SO(6) symmetric Hamiltonian with SO(6) boundary. This work is especially prepared for the seventieth anniversaries of André Swieca (in memoriam) and Roland Köberle.

0808.03921	On the Microscopic Perspective of Black Branes Thermodynamic Geometry	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Stefano Bellucci, Bhupendra Nath Tiwari	Abstract:  In this article we study correspondence between the microscopic spectrum and macroscopic properties of a class of extremal and non-extremal black branes and outline an origin of the interactions among various microstates of a given black brane configuration from the perspective of an intrinsic Riemannian geometry arising from the coarse graining entropy over a large number of microstates. We have analyzed the state-space geometry in the case of various extremal and non-extremal black branes arising from the string theories, multi-centered black brane configurations, small black holes with fractional branes, fuzzy rings in the set up of Mathur's fuzzballs and subensemble theory, as well as that the black brane foams from the considerations of bubbling black brane solutions in the M-theory. We have further shown that there exists a clear mechanism on the black brane side that describes the notion of associated interactions in the state-space or vice-versa. We thus find that in all such cases there are no singularities in the state-space manifold of these black brane configurations. This observation is in turn consistent with the existing picture of corresponding microscopic CFT data. 
0808.03922	Inhomogeneous ferrimagnetic-like behavior in Gd2/3Ca1/3MnO3 single crystals	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:N. Haberkorn, S.Larrégola, D. Franco, G. Nieva	Abstract:  We present a study of the magnetic properties of Gd2/3Ca1/3MnO3 single crystals at low temperatures. We show that this material behave as an inhomogeneous ferrimagnet. In addition to small saturation magnetization at 5 K, we have found history dependent effects in the magnetization and the presence of exchange bias. These features are compatible with microscopic phase separation in the clean Gd2/3Ca1/3MnO3 system studied. 
0808.03923	Gilbert Damping in Conducting Ferromagnets II: Model Tests of the Torque-Correlation Formula	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Ion Garate, Allan MacDonald	Abstract:  We report on a study of Gilbert damping due to particle-hole pair excitations in conducting ferromagnets. We focus on a toy two-band model and on a four-band spherical model which provides an approximate description of ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As. These models are sufficiently simple that disorder-ladder-sum vertex corrections to the long-wavelength spin-spin response function can be summed to all orders. An important objective of this study is to assess the reliability of practical approximate expressions which can be combined with electronic structure calculations to estimate Gilbert damping in more complex systems. 
0808.03924	X-ray stellar population of the LMC	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yael Naze	Abstract:  In the study of stars, the high energy domain occupies a place of choice, since it is the only one able to directly probe the most violent phenomena: indeed, young pre-main sequence objects, hot massive stars, or X-ray binaries are best revealed in X-rays. However, previously available X-ray observatories often provided only crude information on individual objects in the Magellanic Clouds. The advent of the highly efficient X-ray facilities XMM-Newton and Chandra has now dramatically increased the sensitivity and the spatial resolution available to X-ray astronomers, thus enabling a fairly easy determination of the properties of individual sources in the LMC. 
0808.03925	A nanoflare model for active region radiance: application of artificial neural networks	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Bazarghan, H. Safari, D. E. Innes, E. Karami, S.K. Solanki	Abstract:  Context. Nanoflares are small impulsive bursts of energy that blend with and possibly make up much of the solar background emission. Determining their frequency and energy input is central to understanding the heating of the solar corona. One method is to extrapolate the energy frequency distribution of larger individually observed flares to lower energies. Only if the power law exponent is greater than 2, is it considered possible that nanoflares contribute significantly to the energy input. Aims. Time sequences of ultraviolet line radiances observed in the corona of an active region are modelled with the aim of determining the power law exponent of the nanoflare energy distribution. Methods. A simple nanoflare model based on three key parameters (the flare rate, the flare duration time, and the power law exponent of the flare energy frequency distribution) is used to simulate emission line radiances from the ions Fe XIX, Ca XIII, and Si iii, observed by SUMER in the corona of an active region as it rotates around the east limb of the Sun. Light curve pattern recognition by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) scheme is used to determine the values. Results. The power law exponents, alpha 2.8, 2.8, and 2.6 for Fe XIX, Ca XIII, and Si iii respectively. Conclusions. The light curve simulations imply a power law exponent greater than the critical value of 2 for all ion species. This implies that if the energy of flare-like events is extrapolated to low energies, nanoflares could provide a significant contribution to the heating of active region coronae. 
0808.03926	On the Analyticity of Laguerre Series	Classical Analysis and ODEs (math.CA)	Authors:Ernst Joachim Weniger	Abstract:  The transformation of a Laguerre series $f (z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} λ_{n}^{(α)} L_{n}^{(α)} (z)$ to a power series $f (z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} γ_{n} z^{n}$ is discussed. Many nonanalytic functions can be expanded in this way. Thus, success is not guaranteed. Simple sufficient conditions based on the decay rates and sign patters of the $λ_{n}^{(α)}$ as $n \to \infty$ can be formulated which guarantee that $f (z$ is analytic at $z=0$. Meaningful result are obtained if the $λ_{n}^{(α)}$ either decay exponentially or factorially as $n \to \infty$. The situation is much more complicated if the $λ_{n}^{(α)}$ decay algebraically as $n \to \infty$. If the $λ_{n}^{(α)}$ ultimately have the same sign, the series expansions for the power series coefficients diverge, and the corresponding function is not analytic at $z=0. If the $λ_{n}^{(α)}$ ultimately have strictly alternating signs, the series expansions for the power series coefficients are summable and the power series represents an analytic function. In the case of simple $λ_{n}^{(α)}$, the summation of the divergent series for the power series coefficients can often be accomplished with the help of analytic continuation formulas for hypergeometric series, but if the $λ_{n}^{(α)}$ are more complicated, numerical techniques have to be employed. Certain nonlinear sequence transformations -- in particular the so-called delta transformation [E. J. Weniger, Comput. Phys. Rep. \textbf{10}, 189 -- 371 (1989), Eq. (8.4-4)] -- sum the divergent series occurring in this context effectively. 
0808.03927	Static and dynamic glass-glass transitions: a mean-field study	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:Luca Leuzzi	Abstract:  The behavior of a family of mean-field glass models is reviewed. The models are analyzed by means of a Langevin-based approach to the dynamics and a Replica theory computation of the thermodynamics. We focus on the phase diagram of a particular model case, where glass-to-glass transitions occur between phases with a different number of characteristic time-scales for the relaxation processes. The appearence of Johari-Goldstein processes as collective reorganizations of sets of fast processes is discussed. 
0808.03928	On the strength of proof-irrelevant type theories	Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)	Authors:Benjamin Werner	Abstract:  We present a type theory with some proof-irrelevance built into the conversion rule. We argue that this feature is useful when type theory is used as the logical formalism underlying a theorem prover. We also show a close relation with the subset types of the theory of PVS. We show that in these theories, because of the additional extentionality, the axiom of choice implies the decidability of equality, that is, almost classical logic. Finally we describe a simple set-theoretic semantics. 
0808.03929	Direct Observation Limits on Antimatter Gravitation	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Mark Fischler, Joe Lykken, Tom Roberts	Abstract:  The proposed Antihydrogen Gravity experiment at Fermilab (P981) will directly measure the gravitational attraction ("gbar") between antihydrogen and the Earth, with an accuracy of 1% or better. The following key question has been asked by the PAC: Is a possible 1% difference between gbar and g already ruled out by other evidence? This memo presents the key points of existing evidence, to answer whether such a difference is ruled out (a) on the basis of direct observational evidence; and/or (b) on the basis of indirect evidence, combined with reasoning based on strongly held theoretical assumptions. The bottom line is that there are no direct observations or measurements of gravitational asymmetry which address the antimatter sector. There is evidence which by indirect reasoning can be taken to rule out such a difference, but the analysis needed to draw that conclusion rests on models and assumptions which are in question for other reasons and are thus worth testing. There is no compelling evidence or theoretical reason to rule out such a difference at the 1% level. 
0808.03930	Local transfer and spectra of a diffusive field advected by large-scale incompressible flows	Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)	Authors:Chuong V. Tran	Abstract:  This study revisits the problem of advective transfer and spectra of a diffusive scalar field in large-scale incompressible flows in the presence of a (large-scale) source. By ``large-scale'' it is meant that the spectral support of the flows is confined to the wave-number region $k<k_d$, where $k_d$ is relatively small compared with the diffusion wave number $k_κ$. Such flows mediate couplings between neighbouring wave numbers within $k_d$ of each other only. It is found that the spectral rate of transport (flux) of scalar variance across a high wave number $k>k_d$ is bounded from above by $Uk_dkΘ(k,t)$, where $U$ denotes the maximum fluid velocity and $Θ(k,t)$ is the spectrum of the scalar variance, defined as its average over the shell $(k-k_d,k+k_d)$. For a given flux, say $\vartheta>0$, across $k>k_d$, this bound requires $$Θ(k,t)\ge \frac{\vartheta}{Uk_d}k^{-1}.$$ This is consistent with recent numerical studies and with Batchelor's theory that predicts a $k^{-1}$ spectrum (with a slightly different proportionality constant) for the viscous-convective range, which could be identified with $(k_d,k_κ)$. Thus, Batchelor's formula for the variance spectrum is recovered by the present method in the form of a critical lower bound. The present result applies to a broad range of large-scale advection problems in space dimensions $\ge2$, including some filter models of turbulence, for which the turbulent velocity field is advected by a smoothed version of itself. For this case, $Θ(k,t)$ and $\vartheta$ are the kinetic energy spectrum and flux, respectively. 
0808.03931	Radio-frequency induced ground state degeneracy in a Chromium Bose-Einstein condensate	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Q. Beaufils, T. Zanon, R. Chicireanu, B. Laburthe-Tolra, E. Marechal, L. Vernac, J.-C. Keller, O. Gorceix	Abstract:  We study the effect of strong radio-frequency (rf) fields on a chromium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), in a regime where the rf frequency is much larger than the Larmor frequency. We use the modification of the Landé factor by the rf field to bring all Zeeman states to degeneracy, despite the presence of a static magnetic field of up to 100 mG. This is demonstrated by analyzing the trajectories of the atoms under the influence of dressed magnetic potentials in the strong field regime. We investigate the problem of adiabaticity of the rf dressing process, and relate it to how close the dressed states are to degeneracy. Finally, we measure the lifetime of the rf dressed BECs, and identify a new rf-assisted two-body loss process induced by dipole-dipole interactions. 
0808.03932	Nonlinear transmission through a tapered fiber in rubidium vapor	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:S.M. Hendrickson, T.B. Pittman, J.D. Franson	Abstract:  Sub-wavelength diameter tapered optical fibers surrounded by rubidium vapor can undergo a substantial decrease in transmission at high atomic densities due to the accumulation of rubidium atoms on the surface of the fiber. Here we demonstrate the ability to control these changes in transmission using light guided within the taper. We observe transmission through a tapered fiber that is a nonlinear function of the incident power. This effect can also allow a strong control beam to change the transmission of a weak probe beam. 
0808.03933	Spectrum of $π$ Electrons in Graphene as an Alternant Macromolecule and Its Specific Features in Quantum Conductance	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Alexander Onipko	Abstract:  An exact description of $π$ electrons based on the tight-binding model of graphene as an alternant, plane macromolecule is presented. The model molecule can contain an arbitrary number of benzene rings and has armchair- and zigzag-shaped edges. This suggests an instructive alternative to the most commonly used approach, where the reference is made to the honeycomb lattice periodic in its A and B sublattices. Several advantages of the macromolecule model are demonstrated. The newly derived analytical relations detail our understanding of $π$ electron nature in achiral graphene ribbons and carbon tubes and classify these structures as quantum wires. 
0808.03934	Simulating the All-Order Strong Coupling Expansion I: Ising Model Demo	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Ulli Wolff	Abstract:  We investigate in some detail an alternative simulation strategy for lattice field theory based on the so-called worm algorithm introduced by Prokof'ev and Svistunov in 2001. It amounts to stochastically simulating the strong coupling expansion rather than the usual configuration sum. A detailed error analysis and an important generalization of the method are exemplified here in the simple Ising model. It allows for estimates of the two point function where in spite of exponential decay the signal to noise ratio does not degrade at large separation. Critical slowing down is practically absent. In the outlook some thoughts on the general applicability of the method are offered. 
0808.03935	A sectional characterization of the Dade group	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Serge Bouc (LAMFA), Jacques Thévenaz (EPFL/SB/Igat)    	Abstract:  Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p$, let $P$ be a finite $p$- group, where $p$ is an odd prime, and let $D(P)$ be the Dade group of endo-permutation $kP$-modules. It is known that $D(P)$ is detected via deflation--restriction by the family of all sections of $P$ which are elementary abelian of rank $\leq2$. In this paper, we improve this result by characterizing $D(P)$ as the limit (with respect to deflation--restriction maps and conjugation maps) of all groups $D(T/S)$ where $T/S$ runs through all sections of $P$ which are either elementary abelian of rank $\leq3$ or extraspecial of order $p^3$ and exponent $p$. 
0808.03936	Reheating in a Brane Monodromy Inflation Model	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Robert H. Brandenberger, Anke Knauf, Larissa C. Lorenz	Abstract:  We study reheating in a recently proposed brane "monodromy inflation" model in which the inflaton is the position of a D4 brane on a "twisted torus". Specifically, we study the repeated collisions between the D4 brane and a D6 brane (on which the Standard Model fields are assumed to be localized) at a fixed position along the monodromy direction as the D4 brane rolls down its potential. We find that there is no trapping of the rolling D4 brane until it reaches the bottom of its potential, and that reheating is entirely described by the last brane encounter. Previous collisions have negligible effect on the brane velocity and hence on the reheat temperature. In the context of our setup, reheating is efficient and the reheat temperature is therefore high. 
0808.03937	Understanding Fairness and its Impact on Quality of Service in IEEE 802.11	Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)	Authors:Michael Bredel, Markus Fidler	Abstract:  The Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) aims at fair and efficient medium access in IEEE 802.11. In face of its success, it is remarkable that there is little consensus on the actual degree of fairness achieved, particularly bearing its impact on quality of service in mind. In this paper we provide an accurate model for the fairness of the DCF. Given M greedy stations we assume fairness if a tagged station contributes a share of 1/M to the overall number of packets transmitted. We derive the probability distribution of fairness deviations and support our analytical results by an extensive set of measurements. We find a closed-form expression for the improvement of long-term over short-term fairness. Regarding the random countdown values we quantify the significance of their distribution whereas we discover that fairness is largely insensitive to the distribution parameters. Based on our findings we view the DCF as emulating an ideal fair queuing system to quantify the deviations from a fair rate allocation. We deduce a stochastic service curve model for the DCF to predict packet delays in IEEE 802.11. We show how a station can estimate its fair bandwidth share from passive measurements of its traffic arrivals and departures.

Consequences on random matrices, on infinite divisibility and on the arithmetics of the square versions of the free additive and multiplicative convolutions are given.

Kreslo, L. Martinez, M. Messina, U. Moser, B. Rossi, H.-U. Shuetz, M. Zeller	Abstract:  In this paper we report on the evidence for ionization track signals from cosmic ray muons and Compton electrons in a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) filled with liquid Argon and doped with different fractions of Nitrogen. This study has been conducted in view of the possible use of liquid Argon/Nitrogen TPCs for the detection of gamma rays in the resonant band of the Nitrogen absorbtion spectrum, a promising technology for security and medical applications. 
0808.03940	Ion-Size Effect at the Surface of a Silica Hydrosol	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Aleksey M. Tikhonov	Abstract:  The author used synchrotron x-ray reflectivity to study the ion-size effect for alkali ions (Na$^+$, K$^+$, Rb$^+$, and Cs$^+$), with densities as high as $4 \times 10^{18}- 7 \times 10^{18}$ m$^{-2}$, suspended above the surface of a colloidal solution of silica nanoparticles in the field generated by the surface electric-double layer. According to the data, large alkali ions preferentially accumulate at the sol's surface replacing smaller ions, a finding that qualitatively agrees with the dependence of the Kharkats-Ulstrup single-ion electrostatic free energy on the ion's radius. 
0808.03941	On the interaction between two Kerr black holes	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Carlos A. R. Herdeiro, Carmen Rebelo	Abstract:  The double-Kerr solution is generated using both a Backlund transformation and the Belinskii-Zakharov inverse-scattering technique. We build a dictionary between the parametrisations naturally obtained in the two methods and show their equivalence. We then focus on the asymptotically flat double-Kerr system obeying the axis condition which is Z_2^φinvariant; for this system there is an exact formula for the force between the two black holes, in terms of their physical quantities and the coordinate distance. We then show that 1) the angular velocity of the two black holes decreases from the usual Kerr value at infinite distance to zero in the touching limit; 2) the extremal limit of the two black holes is given by |J|=cM^2, where c depends on the distance and varies from one to infinity as the distance decreases; 3) for sufficiently large angular momentum the temperature of the black holes attains a maximum at a certain finite coordinate distance. All of these results are interpreted in terms of the dragging effects of the system. 
0808.03942	Chemical probing spectroscopy of H3+ above the barrier to linearity	Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)	Authors:Holger Kreckel, Dennis Bing, Sascha Reinhardt, Annemieke Petrignani, Max Berg, Andreas Wolf	Abstract:  We have performed chemical probing spectroscopy of H3+ ions trapped in a cryogenic 22-pole ion trap. The ions were buffer-gas cooled to 55K by collisions with helium and argon. Excitation to states above the barrier to linearity was achieved by a Ti:Sa laser operated between 11300 and 13300 cm-1. Subsequent collisions of the excited H3+ ions with argon lead to the formation of ArH+ ions that were detected by a quadrupole mass spectrometer with high sensitivity. We report the observation of 17 previously unobserved transitions to states above the barrier to linearity. Comparison to theoretical calculations suggests that the transition strengths of some of these lines are more than five orders of magnitude smaller than those of the fundamental band, which renders them - to the best of our knowledge - the weakest H3+ transitions observed to date. 
0808.03943	Conservation Laws and Non-Lie Symmetries	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Anthony C.L Ashton	Abstract:  We introduce a method to construct conservation laws for a large class of linear partial differential equations. In contrast to the classical result of Noether, the conserved currents are generated by any symmetry of the operator, including those of the non-Lie type. An explicit example is made of the Dirac equation were we use our construction to find a class of conservation laws associated with a 64 dimensional Lie algebra of discrete symmetries that includes CPT. 
0808.03944	Investigations of the magnetospheric plasma distribution in the vicinity of a pulsar - I Basic formulation	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:John Mc Donald, Andrew Shearer	Abstract:  The magnetospheric plasma distribution in the vicinity of a pulsar at various inclination angles is investigated using a new relativistic, parallel 3D Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code DYMPHNA3D. DYMPHNA3D uses a superposition of the electromagnetic fields associated with a rotating magnetised conducting sphere in a vacuum (the pulsar fields) and the electromagnetic fields due to the presence of the magnetospheric plasma surrounding the pulsar (the plasma fields), as the total fields. The plasma is moved self-consistently through the magnetosphere using the PIC methodology. Our initial simulation results are presented here. These show similar solutions to those obtained from previous numerical simulations, which show the fundamental plasma distribution in the vicinity of an aligned rotating neutron star to consist of two polar domes and an equatorial torus of trapped non-neutral plasma of opposite sign. The aligned case being the case in which the inclination angle between the magnetic dipole moment and the rotation axis of the star is zero. Furthermore, our code allows for off-axis simulations and we have found that this plasma distribution collapses into a Quad-Lobe charge-separated non-neutral magnetospheric plasma distribution in the case of an orthogonal rotator, i.e., the case in which the magnetic dipole moment is oriented at right angles to the rotation axis of the neutron star, with the plasma remaining trapped close to the stellar surface by the force-free surfaces. We find that if initialised with a Goldreich-Julian type distribution, the system is seen to collapse rapidly into these stable Dome-Torus structures. 
0808.03945	CFT adapted gauge invariant formulation of arbitrary spin fields in AdS and modified de Donder gauge	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:R.R. Metsaev	Abstract:  Using Poincare parametrization of AdS space, we study totally symmetric arbitrary spin massless fields in AdS space of dimension greater than or equal to four. CFT adapted gauge invariant formulation for such fields is developed. Gauge symmetries are realized similarly to the ones of Stueckelberg formulation of massive fields. We demonstrate that the curvature and radial coordinate contributions to the gauge transformation and Lagrangian of the AdS fields can be expressed in terms of ladder operators. Realization of the global AdS symmetries in the conformal algebra basis is obtained. Modified de Donder gauge leading to simple gauge fixed Lagrangian is found. The modified de Donder gauge leads to decoupled equations of motion which can easily be solved in terms of Bessel function. Interrelations between our approach to the massless AdS fields and the Stueckelberg approach to massive fields in flat space are discussed. 
0808.03946	Electric excitation of spin resonance in antiferromagnetic conductors	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Revaz Ramazashvili	Abstract:  Antiferromagnetism couples electron spin to its orbital motion, thus allowing excitation of electron-spin transitions by an ac electric rather than magnetic field - with absorption, exceeding that of common electron spin resonance at least by four orders of magnitude. In addition to potential applications in spin electronics, this phenomenon may be used as a spectroscopy to study antiferromagnetic materials of interest - from chromium to borocarbides, cuprates, iron pnictides, and organic and heavy fermion conductors. 
0808.03947	The effects of stochastic population dynamics on food web structure	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:Craig R. Powell, Richard P. Boland	Abstract:  We develop a stochastic, individual-based model for food web simulation which in the large-population limit reduces to the well-studied Webworld model, which has been used to successfully construct model food webs with several realistic features. We demonstrate that an almost exact match is found between the population dynamics in fixed food webs, and that the demographic fluctuations have systematic effects when the new model is used to construct food webs due to the presence of species with small populations. 
0808.03948	The doping-driven evolution of the superconducting state of a doped Mott insulator: a key for the high temperature superconductivity	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:M. Civelli	Abstract:  High-temperature superconductors at zero doping can be considered strongly correlated two-dimensional Mott insulators. The understanding of the connection between the superconductor and the Mott insulator hits at the heart of the high-temperature superconducting mechanism. In this paper we investigate the zero-temperature doping-driven evolution of a superconductor towards the Mott insulator in a two dimensional electron model, relevant for high temperature superconductivity. To this purpose we use a cluster extension of dynamical mean field theory. Our results show that a standard (BCS) d-wave superconductor, realized at high doping, is driven into the Mott insulator via an intermediate state displaying non-standard physical properties. By restoring the translational invariance of the lattice, we give an interpretation of these findings in momentum space. In particular, we show that at a finite doping a strong momentum-space differentiation takes place: non-Fermi liquid and insulating-like (pseudogap) character rises in some regions (anti-nodes), while Fermi liquid quasiparticles survive in other regions (nodes) of momentum space. We describe the consequence of these happenings on the spectral properties, stressing in particular the behavior of the superconducting gap, which reveals two distinct nodal and antinodal energy scales as a function of doping. We propose a description of the evolution of the electronic structure while approaching the Mott transition and compare our results with tunneling experiments, photoemission and magnetotransport on cuprate materials. 
0808.03949	Thulium environment in a silica doped optical fibre	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Wilfried Blanc (LPMC), Thomas Lee Sebastian, Bernard Dussardier (LPMC), Claire Michel (LPMC), Basile Faure (LPMC), Michèle Ude (LPMC), Gérard Monnom (LPMC)    	Abstract:  Thulium-doped optical fibre amplifiers (TDFA) are developed to extend the optical telecommunication wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) bandwidth in the so-called S-band (1460-1530 nm). The radiative transition at 1.47 lm (3H4 -> 3F4) competes with a non-radiative multi-phonon de-excitation (3H4 -> 3H5). The quantum efficiency of the transition of interest is then highly affected by the phonon energy (Ep) of the material. For reliability reasons, oxide glasses are preferred but suffer from high phonon energy. In the case of silica glass, Ep is around 1100 cm-1 and quantum efficiency is as low as 2%. To improve it, phonon energy in the thulium environment must be lowered. For that reason, aluminium is added and we explore three different core compositions: pure silica, and silica slightly modified with germanium or phosphorus. The role of aluminium is studied through fluorescence decay curves, fitted according to the continuous function decay analysis. From this analysis, modification of the thulium local environment due to aluminium is evidenced. 
0808.03950	The Swift capture of a long X-ray burst from XTE J1701-407	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Manuel Linares, Anna L. Watts, Rudy Wijnands, Paolo Soleri, Nathalie Degenaar, Peter A. Curran (Amsterdam), Rhaana L. C. Starling (Leicester), Michiel van der Klis (Amsterdam)    	Abstract:  XTE J1701-407 is a new transient X-ray source discovered on June 8th, 2008. More than one month later it showed a rare type of thermonuclear explosion: a long type I X-ray burst. We report herein the results of our study of the spectral and flux evolution during this burst, as well as the analysis of the outburst in which it took place. We find an upper limit on the distance to the source of 6.1 kpc by considering the maximum luminosity reached by the burst. We measure a total fluence of 3.5*10^{-6} erg/cm^2 throughout the ~20 minutes burst duration and a fluence of 2.6*10^{-3} erg/cm^2 during the first two months of the outburst. We show that the flux decay is best fitted by a power law (index ~1.6) along the tail of the burst. Finally, we discuss the implications of the long burst properties, and the presence of a second and shorter burst detected by Swift ten days later, for the composition of the accreted material and the heating of the burning layer. 
0808.03951	A Pearson Effective Potential for Monte-Carlo simulation of quantum confinement effects in various MOSFET architectures	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:M.-A. Jaud, S. Barraud, P. Dollfus, H. Jaouen	Abstract:  A Pearson Effective Potential model for including quantization effects in the simulation of nanoscale nMOSFETs has been developed. This model, based on a realistic description of the function representing the non zero-size of the electron wave packet, has been used in a Monte-Carlo simulator for bulk, single gate SOI and double-gate SOI devices. In the case of SOI capacitors, the electron density has been computed for a large range of effective field (between 0.1 MV/cm and 1 MV/cm) and for various silicon film thicknesses (between 5 nm and 20 nm). A good agreement with the Schroedinger-Poisson results is obtained both on the total inversion charge and on the electron density profiles. The ability of an Effective Potential approach to accurately reproduce electrostatic quantum confinement effects is clearly demonstrated. 
0808.03952	Flavor Data Constraints on the SUSY Parameter Space	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:F. Mahmoudi	Abstract:  We present an overview of the indirect constraints from flavor physics on supersymmetric models. During the past few years flavor data, and in particular b -> s gamma transitions, have been extensively used in order to constrain supersymmetric parameter spaces. We will briefly illustrate here the constraints obtained by a collection of low energy observables including FCNC transitions, rare decays, leptonic and semileptonic decays of B mesons, as well as leptonic decays of K mesons. The theoretical predictions can be obtained using the computer program SuperIso. 
0808.03953	Comments on Fermi Liquid from Holography	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Manuela Kulaxizi, Andrei Parnachev	Abstract:  We investigate the signatures of Fermi liquid formation in the N=4 super Yang-Mills theory coupled to fundamental hypermultiplet at nonvanishing chemical potential for the global U(1) vector symmetry. At strong 't Hooft coupling the system can be analyzed in terms of the D7 brane dynamics in AdS_5 x S^5 background. The phases with vanishing and finite charge density are separated at zero temperature by a quantum phase transition. In case of vanishing hypermultiplet mass, Karch, Son and Starinets discovered a gapless excitation whose speed equals the speed of sound. We find that this zero sound mode persists to all values of the hypermultiplet mass, and its speed vanishes at the point of phase transition. The value of critical exponent and the ratio of the velocities of zero and first sounds are consistent with the predictions of Landau Fermi liquid theory at strong coupling. 
0808.03954	Emerging attractors and the transition from dissipative to conservative dynamics	Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)	Authors:Christian S. Rodrigues, Alessandro P. S. de Moura, Celso Grebogi	Abstract:  The topological structure of basin boundaries plays a fundamental role in the sensitivity to the initial conditions in chaotic dynamical systems. Herewith we present a study on the dynamics of dissipative systems close to the Hamiltonian limit, emphasising the increasing number of periodic attractors and on the structural changes in their basin boundaries as the dissipation approaches zero. We show numerically that a power law with nontrivial exponent describes the growth of the total number of periodic attractors as the damping is decreased. We also establish that for small scales the dynamics is governed by \emph{effective} dynamical invariants, whose measure depends not only on the region of the phase space, but also on the scale under consideration. Therefore, our results show that the concept of effective invariants is also relevant for dissipative systems. 
0808.03955	Magnetoelectric coupling in the cubic ferrimagnet Cu2OSeO3	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:Jan-Willem G. Bos, Claire V. Colin, Thomas T.M. Palstra	Abstract:  We have investigated the magnetoelectric coupling in the lone pair containing piezoelectric ferrimagnet Cu2OSeO3. Significant magnetocapacitance develops in the magnetically ordered state (TC = 60 K). We find critical behavior near TC and a divergence near the metamagnetic transition at 500 Oe. High-resolution X-ray and neutron powder diffraction measurements show that Cu2OSeO3 is metrically cubic down to 10 K but that the ferrimagnetic ordering reduces the symmetry to rhombohedral R3. The metric cubic lattice dimensions exclude a magnetoelectric coupling mechanism involving spontaneous lattice strain, and this is unique among magnetoelectric and multiferroic materials.

Bhattacharjee	Abstract:  The effect of an external noise on the Lorenz model is investigated near the onset of convection and near the Hopf bifurcation. We show the existence of a diverging time scale near the onset of convection and a resonance near the Hopf bifurcation. Our calculation provides an understanding of the noise induced stabilization of the limit cycle that had been observed numerically. 
0808.03957	Pulsations of the Low Mass ZZ Ceti Star HS 1824+6000	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Justin D. R. Steinfadt, Lars Bildsten, Eran O. Ofek, Shri R. Kulkarni	Abstract:  Measuring g-mode pulsations of isolated white dwarfs can reveal their interior properties to high precision. With a spectroscopic mass of ~0.51 M_{\odot} (log g = 7.82), the DAV white dwarf HS 1824+6000 is near the transition between carbon/oxygen core and helium core white dwarfs, motivating our photometric search for additional pulsations from the Palomar 60-inch telescope. We confirmed (with much greater precision) the three frequencies: 2.751190 +/- 0.000010 mHz (363.479 sec), 3.116709 +/- 0.000006 mHz (320.851 sec), 3.495113 +/- 0.000009 mHz (286.114 sec), previously found by B. Voss and collaborators, and found an additional pulsation at 4.443120 +/- 0.000012 mHz (225.067 sec). These observed frequencies are similar to those found in other ZZ Ceti white dwarfs of comparable mass (e.g. log g < 8). We hope that future observations of much lower mass ZZ Ceti stars (< 0.4 M_{\odot}) will reveal pulsational differences attributable to a hydrogen covered helium core. 
0808.03958	Calibrating a novel type of bolometer arrays for the Herschel/PACS Photometer	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Nicolas Billot	Abstract:  The Herschel Space Observatory is a corner stone mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) scientific program. With its spatial resolution, sensitivity and spectral range (60 to 670 microns) Herschel will provide astronomers with unique opportunities to decipher many aspects of star formation mecanisms and galaxy evolution. Among the many research institutes involved in the development and exploitation of this challenging observatory, the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA) designed a novel type of bolometric detectors to equip the photometer of the PACS instrument on-board the Herschel satellite. In this thesis, I present the basics of infrared astronomy and past and present developments in cryogenic bolometers, emphasising on new concepts introduced by CEA, that is the collective manufacturing of bolometer arrays, the high impedance thermometers, the cold multiplexing and the use of a resonant cavity to optimize absorption of electromagnetic radiation. I follow with an in-depth explanation of the working principles of CEA bolometer arrays, a prerequisite to grasp the strategy of the characterisation procedure that we developed. I then expose and analyse thoroughly the results that we obtained during the calibration campaign of the PACS photometer. Finally, I express detector performances in terms of "observational" performances that future PACS users can comprehend (time constant -> PSF smearing, NEP -> sensitivity, etc.). 
0808.03959	A Simple Extension of the $\modulo$-$Λ$ Transformation	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Uri Erez, Ram Zamir	Abstract:  A simple lemma is derived that allows to transform a general scalar (non-Gaussian, non-additive) continuous-alphabet channel as well as a general multiple-access channel into a modulo-additive noise channel. While in general the transformation is information lossy, it allows to leverage linear coding techniques and capacity results derived for networks comprised of additive Gaussian nodes to more general networks. 
0808.03960	A lower bound on the dimension of a quantum system given measured data	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Stephanie Wehner, Matthias Christandl, Andrew C. Doherty	Abstract:  We imagine an experiment on an unknown quantum mechanical system in which the system is prepared in various ways and a range of measurements are performed. For each measurement M and preparation rho the experimenter can determine, given enough time, the probability of a given outcome a: p(a|M,rho). How large does the Hilbert space of the quantum system have to be in order to allow us to find density matrices and measurement operators that will reproduce the given probability distribution? In this note, we prove a simple lower bound for the dimension of the Hilbert space. The main insight is to relate this problem to the construction of quantum random access codes, for which interesting bounds on Hilbert space dimension already exist. We discuss several applications of our result to hidden variable, or ontological models, to Bell inequalities and to properties of the smooth min-entropy. 
0808.03961	Central Production with Tagged Forward Protons and the Star Detector at RHIC	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:Wlodek Guryn (for the)STAR Collaboration	Abstract:  We describe a setup which will allow extend the physics reach of the STAR detector at RHIC to include the measurement of very forward protons. Tagging on very forward protons, detected by the Roman Pots at RHIC energies, selects processes, in which the proton stays intact and the exchange is dominated by one with the quantum numbers of the vacuum, thus enhancing the probability of measuring reactions where colorless gluonic matter dominates the exchange. The processes include both elastic and inelastic diffraction. The capabilities of the STAR detector to detect Gleuballs and Exotics in central production mechanism are described. 
0808.03962	Optical Diffraction Radiation from a beam off a circular target	Accelerator Physics (physics.acc-ph)	Authors:Tanaji Sen	Abstract:  We calculate the optical diffraction radiation generated by a bunch of high energy particles as they pass through a round hole within an annular metallic ring. We derive expressions for the differential angular spectrum in the far-field and the intensities of the horizontal and vertical polarizations. The sensitivity of the spectrum to changes in beam size and position is shown. The total photon yield from the bunch is calculated and used to set limits on the detectable wavelengths. 
0808.03963	Comment on 'Evolution of the unidirectional electromagnetic pulses in an anisotropic two-level medium'	Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems (nlin.SI)	Authors:N.V. Ustinov	Abstract:  Recently, Zabolotskii [Phys. Rev. E 77, 036603 (2008)] presented the Lax pair for a version of the reduced Maxwell--Bloch equations. This version was derived under considering the unidirectional propagation of a two-component electromagnetic pulse through an anisotropic two-level medium. We demonstrate that his derivation contains essential omission, which led to the wrong version of the reduced Maxwell--Bloch equations. We also point out that the Lax pair for correct version of these equations had been known in the most general anisotropic case. 
0808.03964	A Cubical Set Approach to 2-Bundles with Connection and Wilson Surfaces	Category Theory (math.CT)	Authors:Joao Faria Martins, Roger Picken	Abstract:  In the context of non-abelian gerbes we define a cubical version of categorical group 2-bundles with connection over a smooth manifold. We define their two-dimensional parallel transport, study its properties, and define non-abelian Wilson surface functionals. 
0808.03965	Hadrons in Strong Electric and Magnetic Fields	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Brian C. Tiburzi	Abstract:  We use chiral perturbation theory to investigate hadronic properties in strong electric and magnetic fields. A strong-field power counting is employed, and results for pions and nucleons are obtained using Schwinger's proper-time method. In the limit of weak fields, we accordingly recover the well known one-loop chiral perturbation theory results for the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of pions and nucleons. In strong constant fields, we extend the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation. For the case of electric fields, we find that non-perturbative effects result in hadron decay. For sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the chiral analysis confirms that the nucleon hierarchy becomes inverted giving rise to proton beta-decay. Properties of asymptotic expansions are explored by considering weak field limits. In the regime where the perturbative expansion breaks down, the first-order term gives the best agreement with the non perturbative result. 
0808.03966	On the Direction of Casimir Forces	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Martin Schaden	Abstract:  The Casimir force due to a massless scalar field satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions may attract or repel a piston in the neck of a flask-like container. Using the world-line formalism this behavior is related to the competing contribution to the interaction energy of two types of Brownian bridges. It qualitatively is also expected from attractive long-range two-body forces between constituents of the boundary. A geometric subtraction scheme is presented that avoids divergent contributions to the interaction energy and classifies the Brownian bridges that contribute to the force. These are all of finite length and the Casimir force can be analyzed and in principle accurately computed without resorting to regularization or analytic continuation. The world-line analysis is robust with respect to variations in the shape of the piston and the flask and the analogy with long-range forces suggests that neutral atoms and particles are also drawn into open-ended pipes (or nano-tubes) by Casimir forces of electromagnetic origin. 
0808.03967	Feshbach resonances in an ultracold $^7$Li and $^{87}$Rb mixture	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:C. Marzok, B. Deh, C. Zimmermann, Ph. W. Courteille, E. Tiemann, Y. V. Vanne, A. Saenz	Abstract:  We report on the observation of five Feshbach resonances in collisions between ultracold $^7$Li and $^{87}$Rb atoms in the absolute ground state mixture where both species are in their $|f,m_f>=|1,1>$ hyperfine states. The resonances appear as trap losses for the $^7$Li cloud induced by inelastic heteronuclear three-body collisions. The magnetic field values where they occur are important quantities for an accurate determination of the interspecies interaction potentials. Results of coupled channels calculations based on the observed resonances are presented and refined potential parameters are given. A very broad Feshbach resonance centered around 649 G should allow for fine tuning of the interaction strength in future experiments. 
0808.03968	XAX: a multi-ton, multi-target detection system for dark matter, double beta decay and pp solar neutrinos	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:K. Arisaka, H. Wang, P. F. Smith, D. Cline, A. Teymourian, E. Brown, W. Ooi, D. Aharoni, C. W. Lam, K. Lung, S. Davies, M. Price	Abstract:  A multi-target detection system XAX, comprising concentric 10 ton targets of 136Xe and 129/131Xe, together with a geometrically similar or larger target of liquid Ar, is described. Each is configured as a two-phase scintillation/ionization TPC detector, enhanced by a full 4pi array of ultra-low radioactivity Quartz Photon Intensifying Detectors (QUPIDs) replacing the conventional photomultipliers for detection of scintillation light. It is shown that background levels in XAX can be reduced to the level required for dark matter particle (WIMP) mass measurement at a 10^-10 pb WIMP-nucleon cross section, with single-event sensitivity below 10^-11 pb. The use of multiple target elements allows for confirmation of the A^2 dependence of a coherent cross section, and the different Xe isotopes provide information on the spin-dependence of the dark matter interaction. The event rates observed by Xe and Ar would modulate annually with opposite phases from each other for WIMP mass >~100 GeV/c^2. The large target mass of 136Xe and high degree of background reduction allow neutrinoless double beta decay to be observed with lifetimes of 10^27-10^28 years, corresponding to the Majorana neutrino mass range 0.01-0.1 eV, the most likely range from observed neutrino mass differences. The use of a 136Xe-depleted 129/131Xe target will also allow measurement of the pp solar neutrino spectrum to a precision of 1-2%. 
0808.03969	Suppression of forward dilepton production from an anisotropic quark-gluon plasma	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Mauricio Martinez, Michael Strickland	Abstract:  We calculate the rapidity dependence of leading-order medium dilepton yields resulting from a quark-gluon plasma which has a local time-dependent anisotropy in momentum space. We present a phenomenological model which includes temporal evolution of the plasma anisotropy parameter, xi, and the hard momentum scale, p_hard. Our model interpolates between 1+1 dimensional collisionally-broadened expansion at early times and 1+1 dimensional ideal hydrodynamic expansion at late times. Using our model, we find that at LHC energies, forward high-energy medium dilepton production would be suppressed by up to a factor of 3 if one assumes an isotropization/thermalization time of 2 fm/c. Therefore, it may be possible to use forward dilepton yields to experimentally determine the time of onset of locally isotropic hydrodynamic expansion of the quark-gluon plasma as produced in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. 
0808.03970	Generators and defining relations for ring of differential operators on smooth affine algebraic variety in prime characteristic	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:V. V. Bavula	Abstract:  For ring of differential operators on smooth affine algebraic variety over perfect field of prime characteristic a set of algebra generators and a set of defining relations are found explicitly. 
0808.03971	Networked MIMO with Clustered Linear Precoding	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Jun Zhang, Runhua Chen, Jeffrey G. Andrews, Arunabha Ghosh, Robert W. Heath Jr	Abstract:  A clustered base transceiver station (BTS) coordination strategy is proposed for a large cellular MIMO network, which includes full intra-cluster coordination to enhance the sum rate and limited inter-cluster coordination to reduce interference for the cluster edge users. Multi-cell block diagonalization is used to coordinate the transmissions across multiple BTSs in the same cluster. To satisfy per-BTS power constraints, three combined precoder and power allocation algorithms are proposed with different performance and complexity tradeoffs. For inter-cluster coordination, the coordination area is chosen to balance fairness for edge users and the achievable sum rate. It is shown that a small cluster size (about 7 cells) is sufficient to obtain most of the sum rate benefits from clustered coordination while greatly relieving channel feedback requirement. Simulations show that the proposed coordination strategy efficiently reduces interference and provides a considerable sum rate gain for cellular MIMO networks. 
0808.03972	Stability of roots of polynomials under linear combinations of derivatives	Complex Variables (math.CV)	Authors:Branko Ćurgus, Vania Mascioni	Abstract:  Let $T=α_0 I + α_1 D + ...+α_n D^n$, where $D$ is the differentiation operator and $α_0\not= 0$, and let $f$ be a square-free polynomial with large minimum root separation. We prove that the roots of $Tf$ are close to the roots of $f$ translated by $-α_1/α_0$. 
0808.03973	Randomized benchmarking of single and multi-qubit control in liquid-state NMR quantum information processing	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:C. A. Ryan, M. Laforest, R. Laflamme	Abstract:  Being able to quantify the level of coherent control in a proposed device implementing a quantum information processor (QIP) is an important task for both comparing different devices and assessing a device's prospects with regards to achieving fault-tolerant quantum control. We implement in a liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance QIP the randomized benchmarking protocol presented by Knill et al (PRA 77: 012307 (2008)). We report an error per randomized $\fracπ{2}$ pulse of $1.3 \pm 0.1 \times 10^{-4}$ with a single qubit QIP and show an experimentally relevant error model where the randomized benchmarking gives a signature fidelity decay which is not possible to interpret as a single error per gate. We explore and experimentally investigate multi-qubit extensions of this protocol and report an average error rate for one and two qubit gates of $4.7 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{-3}$ for a three qubit QIP. We estimate that these error rates are still not decoherence limited and thus can be improved with modifications to the control hardware and software. 
0808.03974	Anti-Perfect Morse Stratification	Symplectic Geometry (math.SG)	Authors:Nan-Kuo Ho, Chiu-Chu Melissa Liu	Abstract:  For an equivariant Morse stratification which contains a unique open stratum, we introduce the notion of equivariant antiperfection, which means the difference of the equivariant Morse series and the equivariant Poincare series achieves the maximal possible value (instead of the minimal possible value 0 in the equivariantly perfect case). We also introduce a weaker condition of local equivariant antiperfection. We prove that the Morse stratification of the Yang-Mills functional on the space of connections on a principal U(n)-bundle over a connected, closed, nonorientable surface is locally equivariantly Q-antiperfect when the rank n=2,3; we propose that it is actually equivariantly Q-antiperfect when n=2,3. Our proposal yields formulas of G-equivariant Poincare series of the representation variety of flat G-connections for the nonorientable surface where G=U(2), SU(2), U(3), SU(3). Our rank 2 formulas agree with formulas proved by T. Baird in arXiv:0806.1975. Baird verified our conjectural rank 3 formulas when the nonorientable surface is the real projective plane or the Klein bottle (arXiv:0901.1604); he proved our conjectural U(3) formula for any closed nonorientable surfaces by establishing equivariant Q-antiperfection in this case (arXiv:0902.4581). 
0808.03975	Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment MAMBO I and possible correction of neutron lifetime result	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:A. P. Serebrov, A. K. Fomin	Abstract:  We are discussing the present situation with neutron lifetime measurements. There is a serious discrepancy between the previous experiments and the recent precise experiment [1]. The possible reason of the discrepancy can be connected with a quasi-elastic scattering of UCN on the surface of liquid fomblin which was used for most of the previous experiments. The Monte Carlo simulation of one of the previous experiments [2] shows that the result of this experiment [2] has to be corrected and instead of the previous result 887.6 +/- 3 s the new result 880.4 +/- 3 s has to be claimed.

0808.03976	Interacting particles in two dimensions: numerical solution of the four-dimensional Schrödinger equation in a hypercube	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Andras Vanyolos, Gabor Varga	Abstract:  We study numerically the Coulomb interacting two-particle stationary states of the Schrödinger equation, where the particles are confined in a two-dimensional infinite square well. Inside the domain the particles are subjected to a steeply increasing isotropic harmonic potential, resembling that in a nucleus. For these circumstances we have developed a fully discretized finite difference method of the Numerov-type that approximates the four-dimensional Laplace operator, and thus the whole Schrödinger equation, with a local truncation error of $\mathcal{O}(h^6)$, with $h$ being the uniform step size. The method is built on a 89-point central difference scheme in the four-dimensional grid. As expected from the general theorem by Keller [Num.\ Math. \textbf{7}, 412 (1965)], the error of eigenvalues so obtained are found to be the same order of magnitude which we have proved analytically as well. 
0808.03977	The Soft-Wall Standard Model	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Brian Batell, Tony Gherghetta, Daniel Sword	Abstract:  We explore the possibility of modeling electroweak physics in a warped extra dimension with a soft wall. The infrared boundary is replaced with a smoothly varying dilaton field that provides a dynamical spacetime cutoff. We analyze gravity, gauge fields, and fermions in the soft-wall background and obtain a discrete spectrum of Kaluza-Klein states which can exhibit linear Regge-like behavior. Bulk Yukawa interactions give rise to nonconstant fermion mass terms, leading to fermion localization in the soft-wall background and a possible explanation of the Standard Model flavor structure. Furthermore we construct electroweak models with custodial symmetry, where the gauge symmetry is broken with a bulk Higgs condensate. The electroweak constraints are not as stringent as in hard-wall models, allowing Kaluza-Klein masses of order the TeV scale. 
0808.03978	Preparation of facilities for fundamental research with ultracold neutrons at PNPI	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:A. P. Serebrov, V. A. Mityuklyaev, A. A. Zakharov, A. N. Erykalov, M. S. Onegin, A. K. Fomin, V. A. Ilatovskiy, S. P. Orlov, K. A. Konoplev, A. G. Krivshitch, V. M. Samsonov, V. F. Ezhov, V. V. Fedorov, K. O. Keshyshev, S. T. Boldarev, V. I. Marchenko	Abstract:  The WWR-M reactor of PNPI offers a unique opportunity to prepare a source for ultracold neutrons (UCN) in an environment of high neutron flux (about 3*10^12 n/cm^2/s) at still acceptable radiation heat release (about 4*10^-3 W/g). It can be realized within the reactor thermal column situated close to the reactor core. With its large diameter of 1 m, this channel allows to install a 15 cm thick bismuth shielding, a graphite premoderator (300 dm^3 at 20 K), and a superfluid helium converter (35 dm^3). At a temperature of 1.2 K it is possible to remove the heat release power of about 20 W. Using the 4pi flux of cold neutrons within the reactor column can bring more than a factor 100 of cold neutron flux incident on the superfluid helium with respect to the present cold neutron beam conditions at the ILL reactor. The storage lifetime for UCN in superfluid He at 1.2 K is about 30 s, which is sufficient when feeding experiments requiring a similar filling time. The calculated density of UCN with energy between 50 neV and 250 neV in an experimental volume of 40 liters is about 10^4 n/cm^3. Technical solutions for realization of the project are discussed. 
0808.03979	Least Squares Methods for Equidistant Tree Reconstruction	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Conor Fahey, Serkan Hosten, Nathan Krieger, Leslie Timpe	Abstract:  UPGMA is a heuristic method identifying the least squares equidistant phylogenetic tree given empirical distance data among $n$ taxa. We study this classic algorithm using the geometry of the space of all equidistant trees with $n$ leaves, also known as the Bergman complex of the graphical matroid for the complete graph $K_n$. We show that UPGMA performs an orthogonal projection of the data onto a maximal cell of the Bergman complex. We also show that the equidistant tree with the least (Euclidean) distance from the data is obtained from such an orthogonal projection, but not necessarily given by UPGMA. Using this geometric information we give an extension of the UPGMA algorithm. We also present a branch and bound method for finding the best equidistant tree. Finally, we prove that there are distance data among $n$ taxa which project to at least $(n-1)!$ equidistant trees. 
0808.03980	Solar Coronal Structures and Stray Light in TRACE	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:C.E. DeForest, P.C.H. Martens, M.J. Wills-Davey	Abstract:  Using the 2004 Venus transit of the Sun to constrain a semi-empirical point-spread function for the TRACE EUV solar telescope, we have measured the effect of stray light in that telescope. We find that 43% of 171A EUV light that enters TRACE is scattered, either through diffraction off the entrance filter grid or through other nonspecular effects. We carry this result forward, via known-PSF deconvolution of TRACE images, to identify its effect on analysis of TRACE data. Known-PSF deconvolution by this derived PSF greatly reduces the effect of visible haze in the TRACE 171A images, enhances bright features, and reveals that the smooth background component of the corona is considerably less bright (and hence much more rarefied) than commonly supposed. Deconvolution reveals that some prior conlclusions about the Sun appear to have been based on stray light in the images. In particular, the diffuse background "quiet corona" becomes consistent with hydrostatic support of the coronal plasma; feature contrast is greatly increased, possibly affecting derived parameters such as the form of the coronal heating function; and essentially all existing differential emission measure studies of small features appear to be affected by contamination from nearby features. We speculate on further implications of stray light for interpretation of EUV images from TRACE and similar instruments, and advocate deconvolution as a standard tool for image analysis with future instruments such as SDO/AIA. 
0808.03981	Deformations of glassy polymers in very low temperature regime within cylindrical micropores	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:Guanghua Zhu	Abstract:  The deformation kinetics for glassy polymers confined in microscopic domain at very low temperature regime was investigated using a transition-rate-state dependent model considering the shear thinning behavior which means, once material being subjected to high shear rates, the viscosity diminishes with increasing shear rate. The preliminary results show that there might be nearly frictionless fields for rate of deformation due to the almost vanishing shear stress in micropores at very low temperature regime subjected to some surface conditions : The relatively larger roughness (compared to the macroscopic domain) inside micropores and the slip. As the pore size decreases, the surface-to-volume ratio increases and therefore, surface roughness will greatly affect the deformation kinetics in micropores. By using the boundary perturbation method, we obtained a class of temperature and activation energy dependent fields for the deformation kinetics at low temperature regime with the presumed small wavy roughness distributed along the walls of an cylindrical micropore. The critical deformation kinetics of the glassy matter is dependent upon the temperature, activation energy, activation volume, orientation dependent and is proportional to the (referenced) shear rate, the slip length, the amplitude and the orientation of the wavy-roughness.

Theoretical properties, model results, and perspectives to access experimental information on this leading twist, transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function are reviewed. Its relation to helicity and transversity distributions is highlighted. 
0808.03983	Dark Bursts in the Swift Era: The Palomar 60 inch-Swift Early Optical Afterglow Catalog	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:S. B. Cenko, J. Kelemen, F. A. Harrison, D. B. Fox, S. R. Kulkarni, M. M. Kasliwal, E. O. Ofek, A. Rau, A. Gal-Yam, D. A. Frail, D.-S. Moon	Abstract:  We present multi-color optical observations of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) made over a three year period with the robotic Palomar 60 inch telescope (P60). Our sample consists of all 29 events discovered by Swift for which P60 began observations less than one hour after the burst trigger. We were able to recover 80% of the optical afterglows from this prompt sample, and we attribute this high efficiency to our red coverage. Like Melandri et al. (2008), we find that a significant fraction (~ 50%) of Swift events show a suppression of the optical flux with regards to the X-ray emission (so-called "dark" bursts). Our multi-color photometry demonstrates this is likely due in large part to extinction in the host galaxy. We argue that previous studies, by selecting only the brightest and best-sampled optical afterglows, have significantly underestimated the amount of dust present in typical GRB environments. 
0808.03984	Empirical LCAO parameters for $π$ molecular orbitals in planar organic molecules	Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)	Authors:Laurence Hawke, George Kalosakas, Constantinos Simserides	Abstract:  We present a parametrization within a simplified LCAO model (a type of Hueckel model) for the description of $π$ molecular orbitals in organic molecules containing $π$-bonds between carbon, nitrogen, or oxygen atoms with $sp^2$ hybridization, which we show to be quite accurate in predicting the energy of the highest occupied $π$ orbital and the first $π$-$π*$ transition energy for a large set of organic compounds. We provide four empirical parameter values for the diagonal matrix elements of the LCAO description, corresponding to atoms of carbon, nitrogen with one $p_z$ electron, nitrogen with two $p_z$ electrons, and oxygen. The bond-length dependent formula (proportional to $1/d^2$) of Harrison is used for the non-diagonal matrix elements between neighboring atoms. The predictions of our calculations have been tested against available experimental results in more than sixty organic molecules, including benzene and its derivatives, polyacenes, aromatic hydrocarbons of various geometries, polyenes, ketones, aldehydes, azabenzenes, nucleic acid bases and others. The comparison is rather successful, taking into account the small number of parameters and the simplicity of the LCAO method, involving only $p_z$ atomic orbitals, which leads even to analytical calculations in some cases. 
0808.03985	X-ray and UV spectroscopy of Galactic diffuse hot gas along the LMC X--3 sight line	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Y. Yao, Q. D. Wang, T. Hagihara, K. Mitsuda, D. McCammon, N. Y. Yamasaki	Abstract:  We present Suzaku spectra of X-ray emission in the fields just off the LMC X-3 sight line. OVII, OVIII, and NeIX emission lines are clearly detected, suggesting the presence of an optically thin thermal plasma with an average temperature of 2.4E6. This temperature is significantly higher than that inferred from existing X-ray absorption line data obtained with Chandra grating observations of LMC X-3, strongly suggesting that the gas is not isothermal. We then jointly analyze these data to characterize the spatial and temperature distributions of the gas. Assuming a vertical exponential Galactic disk model, we estimate the gas temperature and density at the Galactic plane and their scale heights as 3.6(2.9, 4.7)E6 K and 1.4(0.3, 3.4)E-3 cm^{-3} and 1.4(0.2, 5.2) kpc and $2.8(1.0, 6.4)$ kpc, respectively. This characterization can account for all the \ovi line absorption, as observed in a FUSE spectrum of LMC X-3, but only predicts less than one tenth of the OVI line emission intensity typically detected at high Galactic latitudes. The bulk of the OVI emission most likely arises at interfaces between cool and hot gases. 
0808.03986	Implications for C-14 Dating of the Jenkins-Fischbach Effect and Possible Fluctuation of the Solar Fusion Rate	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Alvin J. Sanders	Abstract:  It has long been known that the C-14 calibration curve, which relates the known age of tree rings to their apparent C-14 ages, includes a number of "wiggles" which clearly are not experimental errors or other random effects. A reasonable interpretation of these wiggles is that they indicate that the Sun's fusion "furnace" is pulsating, perhaps for reasons similar to that of the Cepheid variables, albeit under a very different regime of pressure and temperature. If this speculation is correct, we are seeing the heartbeat of the Sun-the C-14 calibration curve is the Sun's "neutrino-cardiogram." Elevated neutrino flux during a relatively brief period would have two effects: (1) a surge in C-14 fraction in the atmosphere, which would make biological samples that were alive during the surge appear to be "too young" (2) depletion of C-14 in the biotic matter already dead at the time of the surge; this is a consequence of the recently discovered Jenkins-Fischbach effect, which is an observed correlation between nuclear decay rates and solar activity or Earth-Sun distance. In addition, the precise value at any given time of the "half-life" of any unstable isotope-including C-14-must now be considered in doubt, since the Jenkins-Fischbach effect implies that we may no longer view the decay rate of an isotope as intrinsically governed and therefore a constant of Nature. 
0808.03987	Atmospheric composition and structure of HD209458b	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J.-M. Désert, A. Vidal-Madjar, A. Lecavelier des Etangs, D. Sing, D. Ehrenreich, G. Hébrard, R. Ferlet	Abstract:  Transiting planets like HD209458b offer a unique opportunity to scrutinize their atmospheric composition and structure. Transit spectroscopy probes the transition region between the day and night sides, called limb. We present a re-analysis of existing archived HST/STIS transmission spectra of HD209458b's atmosphere. From these observations we: Identify H2 Rayleigh scattering, derive the absolute Sodium abundance and quantify its depletion in the upper atmosphere, extract a stratospheric T-P profile with a temperature inversion and explain broad band absorptions with the presence of TiO and VO molecules in the atmosphere of this planet. 
0808.03988	Spatial and Temporal Heterogeneity of Host-Parasitoid Interactions in Lupine Habitat	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:Roy Werner Wright	Abstract:  The inhabitants of the bush lupine in coastal California have been the subject of scientific scrutiny in recent years. Observations of a host-parasitoid interaction in the shrub's foliage, in which victims are significantly less motile than their exploiters, record stable spatial patterns in a fairly homogeneous environment. Though such pattern formation has been found in reaction-diffusion models, the correspondence of these models to continuous-time predator-prey interactions does not reflect the reality of the system being studied. Near the root of the lupine, another host-parasitoid interaction is also of considerable interest. In some cases this interaction, which promotes the health of the lupine, has been observed to be much more persistent than suggested by mathematical models. In this work a discrete-time spatial model of the first host-parasitoid system is introduced. We analyze the model, describing its transient behavior and finding the conditions under which spatial patterns occur, as well as an estimate of outbreak size under those conditions. We consider the feasibility of the necessary conditions in the natural system by modeling the mechanisms responsible for them, and discuss the effects of variable habitat on pattern formation. We also explore one possible explanation for the persistence of the second host-parasitoid system -- the existence of an alternate host. Under certain surprising conditions and by means quite different from previous models of similar situations, an alternate host can greatly enhance persistence of the nematode parasitoid.

Its main purpose is to present an accessible introduction to a technique allowing efficient calculations in Lagrangian Floer theory. 
0808.03990	Adaptive Dynamic Congestion Avoidance with Master Equation	Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)	Authors:Mehmet Süzen, Ziya Süzen	Abstract:  This paper proposes an adaptive variant of Random Early Detection (RED) gateway queue management for packet-switched networks via a discrete state analog of the non-stationary Master Equation i.e. Markov process. The computation of average queue size, which appeared in the original RED algorithm, is altered by introducing a probability $P(l,t)$, which defines the probability of having $l$ number of packets in the queue at the given time $t$, and depends upon the previous state of the queue. This brings the advantage of eliminating a free parameter: queue weight, completely. Computation of transition rates and probabilities are carried out on the fly, and determined by the algorithm automatically. Simulations with unstructured packets illustrate the method, the performance of the adaptive variant of RED algorithm, and the comparison with the standard RED. 
0808.03991	Photoproduction in Ultra-Peripheral Heavy Ion Collisions at STAR	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:Boris Grube, for the STAR Collaboration	Abstract:  We present recent STAR results on photoproduction in ultra-peripheral relativistic heavy ion collisions. In these collisions the impact parameter of the beam particles is larger than the sum of their nuclear radii, so that they interact via their long-range Coulomb fields. STAR has measured the production of $ρ^0(770)$ mesons in exclusive reactions as well as in processes with mutual nuclear excitation of the beam particles. We present results for the $ρ^0$ production cross section in Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV for coherent as well as incoherent coupling. The dependence of the cross section on the $ρ^0$ rapidity is compared to theoretical models. We also studied the ratio of coherent $ρ^0$ to direct $π^+π^-$ production as well as the $ρ^0$ helicity matrix elements and we observe interference effects in the $ρ^0$ production. In addition STAR has measured the production of $ρ^0$ mesons in d-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV and that of $e^+e^-$-pairs in Au-Au at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. We also see an enhancement around 1510 MeV/c in $π^+π^-π^+π^-$ final states in Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. 
0808.03992	Modeling Stellar Atmospheres with a Spherically Symmetric Version of the Atlas Code: Testing the Code by Comparisons to Interferometric Observations and PHOENIX Models	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Hilding R. Neilson (University of Toronto), John B. Lester (University of Toronto Mississauga)    	Abstract:  One of the current opportunities for stellar atmospheric modeling is the interpretation of optical interferometric data of stars. Starting from the robust, open source ATLAS atmospheric code (Kurucz, 1979), we have developed a spherically symmetric code, SATLAS, as a new option for modeling stellar atmospheres of low gravity stars. The SATLAS code is tested against both interferometric observations of M giants by Wittkowski and collaborators, and spherically symmetric M giant NextGen models from the PHOENIX code. The SATLAS models predict interferometric visibilities that agree with the observed visibilities and with predicted visibilities, and the SATLAS atmospheric structures also agree with those from spherical PHOENIX models, with just small differences in temperature and pressure at large depths in the atmospheres. 
0808.03993	On the Stability of Electrostatic Orbits	Classical Physics (physics.class-ph)	Authors:Shubho Banerjee, Bradford Taylor, Anand Banerjee	Abstract:  We analyze the stability of two charged conducting spheres orbiting each other. Due to charge polarization, the electrostatic force between the two spheres deviates significantly from $1/r^2$ as they come close to each other. As a consequence, there exists a critical angular momentum, $L_c$, with a corresponding critical radius $r_c$. For $L > L_c$ two circular orbits are possible: one at $r > r_c$ that is stable and the other at $r < r_c$ that is unstable. This critical behavior is analyzed as a function of the charge and the size ratios of the two spheres. 
0808.03994	Changes in Dark Matter Properties After Freeze-Out	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Timothy Cohen, David E. Morrissey, Aaron Pierce	Abstract:  The properties of the dark matter that determine its thermal relic abundance can be very different from the dark matter properties today. We investigate this possibility by coupling a dark matter sector to a scalar that undergoes a phase transition after the dark matter freezes out. If the value of Omega_DM h^2 calculated from parameters measured at colliders and by direct and indirect detection experiments does not match the astrophysically observed value, a novel cosmology of this type could provide the explanation. This mechanism also has the potential to account for the "boost factor" required to explain the PAMELA data. 
0808.03995	Modeling Mass-Loss and Infrared Excess in Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Hilding R. Neilson (University of Toronto), Chow-Choong Ngeow (UIUC), Shashi M. Kanbur (SUNY Oswego), John B. Lester (University of Toronto Mississauga)    	Abstract:  The purpose of this preliminary work is to determine if Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Cepheids have stellar winds. If a Cepheid undergoes mass loss then at some distance from the star, a fraction of the gas becomes dust, which causes an infrared excess. Mass loss is tested using OGLE II optical observations and SAGE infrared observations for a sample of 488 Cepheids. The resultant mass-loss rates range from $10^{-12}$ to $10^{-7}$ $M_\odot/yr$. Using the mass--loss model we compute infrared stellar luminosities for the sample of Cepheids and compare predicted infrared PL relations with observed relations. The predicted relations not only vary from the observed relations, implying mass loss plays a significant role, but also show evidence for non-linearity. It is determined that mass loss is important for LMC Cepheids. 
0808.03996	Dynamical and Statistical Criticality in a Model of Neural Tissue	Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)	Authors:Marcelo O. Magnasco, Oreste Piro, Guillermo A. Cecchi	Abstract:  For the nervous system to work at all, a delicate balance of excitation and inhibition must be achieved. However, when such a balance is sought by global strategies, only few modes remain balanced close to instability, and all other modes are strongly stable. Here we present a simple model of neural tissue in which this balance is sought locally by neurons following `anti-Hebbian' behavior: {\sl all} degrees of freedom achieve a close balance of excitation and inhibition and become "critical" in the dynamical sense. At long timescales, the modes of our model oscillate around the instability line, so an extremely complex "breakout" dynamics ensues in which different modes of the system oscillate between prominence and extinction. We show the system develops various anomalous statistical behaviours and hence becomes self-organized critical in the statistical sense. 
0808.03997	Viability for stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion	Dynamical Systems (math.DS)	Authors:Ioana Ciotir, Aurel Rascanu	Abstract:  In this paper we prove a viability result for multidimensional, time dependent, stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter1/2 < H < 1, using pathwise approach. The sufficient condition is also an alternative global existence result for the fractional differential equations with restrictions on the state. 
0808.03998	Emergence of a Quasar Outflow	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:F. Hamann, K. F. Kaplan, P. Rodriguez Hidalgo, J. X. Prochaska, S. Herbert-Fort	Abstract:  We report the first discovery of the emergence of a high-velocity broad-line outflow in a luminous quasar, J105400.40+034801.2 at redshift z ~ 2.1. The outflow is evident in ultraviolet CIV and SiIV absorption lines with velocity shifts v ~ 26,300 km/s and deblended widths FWHM ~ 4000 km/s. These features are marginally strong and broad enough to be considered broad absorption lines (BALs), but their large velocities exclude them from the standard BAL definition. The outflow lines appeared between two observations in the years 2002.18 and 2006.96. A third observation in 2008.48 showed the lines becoming ~40% weaker and 10% to 15% narrower. There is no evidence for acceleration or for any outflow gas at velocities <23,000 km/s. The lines appear to be optically thick, with the absorber covering just 20% of the quasar continuum source. This indicates a characteristic absorber size of ~4 x 10^15 cm, but with a BAL-like total column density log N_H (cm^-2) > 21.2 and average space density n_H > 2 x 10^5 cm^-3. We attribute the emergence of the outflow lines to a substantial flow structure moving across our line of sight, possibly near the ragged edge of the main BAL flow or possibly related to the onset of a BAL evolutionary phase. 
0808.03999	Alpha Channeling in a Rotating Plasma	Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)	Authors:Abraham J. Fetterman, Nathaniel J. Fisch	Abstract:  The wave-particle alpha-channeling effect is generalized to include rotating plasma. Specifically, radio frequency waves can resonate with alpha particles in a mirror machine with ExB rotation to diffuse the alpha particles along constrained paths in phase space. Of major interest is that the alpha-particle energy, in addition to amplifying the RF waves, can directly enhance the rotation energy which in turn provides additional plasma confinement in centrifugal fusion reactors. An ancillary benefit is the rapid removal of alpha particles, which increases the fusion reactivity. 
0808.04000	Precision and Casimir Force Measurements in Superfluid and Vacuum with Silicon Nitride Membranes	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Steve Lamoreaux	Abstract:  The recent discovery that silicon nitride membranes can be used as extremely high Q mechanical resonators makes possible a number of novel experiments, which include improved long range vacuum Casimir force measurements, and measurments of the properties of liquid helium below the lambda point. It is noted that in the thermal correction to the Casimir force, the phase velocity of the excitations does not enter, with the force per unit area between parallel plates depending only on the temperature and distance between the plates. Thus it appears as possible to measure the phonon analog of the finite temperature Casimir force in liquid helium. 
0808.04001	A Stellar Dynamical Measurement of the Black Hole Mass in the Maser Galaxy NGC 4258	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Christos Siopis, Karl Gebhardt, Tod R. Lauer, John Kormendy, Jason Pinkney, Douglas Richstone, S. M. Faber, Scott Tremaine, M. C. Aller, Ralf Bender, Gary Bower, Alan Dressler, Alexei V. Filippenko, Richard Green, Luis C. Ho, John Magorrian	Abstract:  We determine the mass of the black hole at the center of the spiral galaxy NGC 4258 by constructing axisymmetric dynamical models of the galaxy. These models are constrained by high spatial resolution imaging and long-slit spectroscopy of the nuclear region obtained with the {\em Hubble Space Telescope}, complemented by ground-based observations extending to larger radii. Our best mass estimate is $\MBH = (3.3 \pm 0.2) \times 10^7 \MSun $ for a distance of 7.28 Mpc (statistical errors only). This is within 15% of $ (3.82\pm 0.01) \times 10^7 \MSun$, the mass determined from the kinematics of water masers (rescaled to the same distance) assuming they are in Keplerian rotation in a warped disk. The construction of accurate dynamical models of NGC 4258 is somewhat compromised by an unresolved active nucleus and color gradients, the latter caused by variations in the stellar population and/or obscuring dust. These problems are not present in the $\sim 30$ other black hole mass determinations from stellar dynamics that have been published by us and other groups; thus, the relatively close agreement between the stellar dynamical mass and the maser mass in NGC 4258 enhances our confidence in the black hole masses determined in other galaxies from stellar dynamics using similar methods and data of comparable quality. 
0808.04002	Gravitational-Wave Extraction from Neutron Star Oscillations: comparing linear and nonlinear techniques	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Luca Baiotti, Sebastiano Bernuzzi, Giovanni Corvino, Roberto De Pietri, Alessandro Nagar	Abstract:  The main aim of this study is the comparison of gravitational waveforms obtained from numerical simulations which employ different numerical evolution approaches and different wave-extraction techniques. For this purpose, we evolve an oscillating, non-rotating polytropic neutron-star model with two different approaches: a full nonlinear relativistic simulation (in three dimensions) and a linear simulation based on perturbation theory. The extraction of the gravitational-wave signal is performed with three methods: The gauge-invariant curvature-perturbation theory based on the Newman-Penrose scalar $ψ_4$; The gauge-invariant Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-Moncrief metric-perturbation theory of a Schwarzschild space-time; Some generalization of the quadrupole emission formula. 
0808.04003	Counting Solutions for the N-queens and Latin Square Problems by Efficient Monte Carlo Simulations	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Cheng Zhang, Jianpeng Ma	Abstract:  We apply Monte Carlo simulations to count the numbers of solutions of two well-known combinatorial problems: the N-queens problem and Latin square problem. The original system is first converted to a general thermodynamic system, from which the number of solutions of the original system is obtained by using the method of computing the partition function. Collective moves are used to further accelerate sampling: swap moves are used in the N-queens problem and a cluster algorithm is developed for the Latin squares. The method can handle systems of $10^4$ degrees of freedom with more than $10^10000$ solutions. We also observe a distinct finite size effect of the Latin square system: its heat capacity gradually develops a second maximum as the size increases. 
0808.04004	Measuring the undetectable: Proper motions and parallaxes of very faint sources	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Dustin Lang (Toronto), David W. Hogg (NYU, MPIA), Sebastian Jester (MPIA), Hans-Walter Rix (MPIA)    	Abstract:  The near future of astrophysics involves many large solid-angle, multi-epoch, multi-band imaging surveys. These surveys will, at their faint limits, have data on large numbers of sources that are too faint to be detected at any individual epoch. Here we show that it is possible to measure in multi-epoch data not only the fluxes and positions, but also the parallaxes and proper motions of sources that are too faint to be detected at any individual epoch. The method involves fitting a model of a moving point source simultaneously to all imaging, taking account of the noise and point-spread function in each image. By this method it is possible to measure the proper motion of a point source with an uncertainty close to the minimum possible uncertainty given the information in the data, which is limited by the point-spread function, the distribution of observation times (epochs), and the total signal-to-noise in the combined data. We demonstrate our technique on multi-epoch Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging of the SDSS Southern Stripe. We show that we can distinguish very red brown dwarfs by their proper motions from very high-redshift quasars more than $1.6\mag$ fainter than with traditional technique on these SDSS data, and with better better fidelity than by multi-band imaging alone. We re-discover all 10 known brown dwarfs in our sample and present 9 new candidate brown dwarfs, identified on the basis of high proper motion. 
0808.04005	The Scalar Curvature Equation on $S^3$	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Matthias Schneider	Abstract:  We give existence results for solutions of the prescribed scalar curvature equation on $S^3$, when the curvature function is a positive Morse function and satisfies an index-count condition. 
0808.04006	Non-thermal emission from supernova shock breakout and the origin of the X-ray transient associated with SN2008D	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Xiang-Yu Wang, Zhuo Li, Eli Waxman, Peter Meszaros	Abstract:  We suggest that non-thermal emission can be produced by multiple scatterings of the photons between the supernova ejecta and pre-shock material in supernova shock breakout. Such bulk-Comptonization process may significantly change the original thermal photon spectrum, forming a power-law non-thermal component at higher energies. We then show that the luminous X-ray outburst XRO081009 associated with SN2008D is likely to be such shock breakout emission from an ordinary type Ib/c supernova.

Carter	Abstract:  Spin-cast all-inorganic nanoparticle solutions have been used to make a CdTe/CdSe solar cell with an efficiency of up to 2.8% without alumina or calcium buffer layers. The type of junction and non-selective nature of the contacts made to these devices is explored. 
0808.04008	Visual Observation and Quantitative Measurement of the Microwave Absorbing Effect at X band	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:L. Zhao, X. Chen, C. K. Ong	Abstract:  We have setup a simple field mapping measure system to describe graphically the 2D quasi-free-space electromagnetic wave in a parallel plate waveguide at the X-band frequencies. Our apparatus illustrates a potential application in characterizing the microwave absorbing materials. The visual demonstration about the physical process and quantitative measurement of reflectivity coefficients can be achieved. This simple apparatus has have an advantage over with conventional testing methods which usually involve huge, expensive anechoic chambers and demand samples of large size. 
0808.04009	Fourier transform of function on locally compact Abelian groups taking value in Banach spaces	Functional Analysis (math.FA)	Authors:Yauhen Radyna, Anna Sidorik	Abstract:  We consider Fourier transform of vector-valued functions on a locally compact group $G$, which take value in a Banach space $X$, and are square-integrable in Bochner sense. If $G$ is a finite group then Fourier transform is a bounded operator. If $G$ is an infinite group then Fourier transform $F: L_2(G,X)\to L_2(\widehat G,X)$ is a bounded operator if and only if Banach space $X$ is isomorphic to a Hilbert one. 
0808.04010	A priori Holder estimate, parabolic Harnack principle and heat kernel estimates for diffusions with jumps	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Zhen-Qing Chen, Takashi Kumagai	Abstract:  In this paper, we consider the following type of non-local (pseudo-differential) operators $\LL $ on $\R^d$: $$ \LL u(x) =\frac12 \sum_{i, j=1}^d \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} (a_{ij}(x) \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}) + \lim_{\eps \downarrow 0} \int_{\{y\in \R^d: |y-x|>\eps\}} (u(y)-u(x)) J(x, y) dy, $$ where $A(x)=(a_{ij}(x))_{1\leq i, j\leq d}$ is a measurable $d\times d$ matrix-valued function on $\R^d$ that is uniform elliptic and bounded and $J$ is a symmetric measurable non-trivial non-negative kernel on $\R^d\times \R^d$ satisfying certain conditions. Corresponding to $\LL$ is a symmetric strong Markov process $X$ on $\R^d$ that has both the diffusion component and pure jump component. We establish a priori Hölder estimate for bounded parabolic functions of $\LL$ and parabolic Harnack principle for positive parabolic functions of $\LL$. Moreover, two-sided sharp heat kernel estimates are derived for such operator $\LL$ and jump-diffusion $X$. In particular, our results apply to the mixture of symmetric diffusion of uniformly elliptic divergence form operator and mixed stable-like processes on $\R^d$. To establish these results, we employ methods from both probability theory and analysis. 
0808.04011	The origin of lopsidedness in galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Mapelli (1), B. Moore (1), J. Bland-Hawthorn (2) ((1)University of Zurich, (2)University of Sydney)    	Abstract:  It has long been known that a large fraction of disc galaxies are lopsided. We simulate three different mechanisms that can induce lopsidedness: flyby interactions, gas accretion from cosmological filaments and ram pressure from the intergalactic medium. Comparing the morphologies, HI spectrum and m=1 Fourier components, we find that all of these mechanisms can induce lopsidedness in the gaseous component of disc galaxies. In particular, we estimate that flybys can contribute to ~20 per cent of lopsided galaxies. We compare our simulations with the observations of NGC 891, a lopsided, edge-on galaxy with a nearby companion (UGC 1807). We find that the main properties of NGC 891 favour a flyby event for the origin of lopsidedness in this galaxy. 
0808.04012	Robust hedging of double touch barrier options	Pricing of Securities (q-fin.PR)	Authors:Alexander M. G. Cox, Jan K. Obłój	Abstract:  We consider model-free pricing of digital options, which pay out if the underlying asset has crossed both upper and lower barriers. We make only weak assumptions about the underlying process (typically continuity), but assume that the initial prices of call options with the same maturity and all strikes are known. Under such circumstances, we are able to give upper and lower bounds on the arbitrage-free prices of the relevant options, and further, using techniques from the theory of Skorokhod embeddings, to show that these bounds are tight. Additionally, martingale inequalities are derived, which provide the trading strategies with which we are able to realise any potential arbitrages. We show that, depending of the risk aversion of the investor, the resulting hedging strategies can outperform significantly the standard delta/vega-hedging in presence of market frictions and/or model misspecification. 
0808.04013	Anomaly Mediation and Radius Stabilization by a Boundary Constant Superpotential in a Warped Space	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Nobuhito Maru, Norisuke Sakai, Nobuhiro Uekusa	Abstract:  We present a very simple model of the radius stabilization in a supersymmetric (SUSY) Randall-Sundrum model with a hypermultiplet and a boundary constant superpotential. A wide range of parameters where the anomaly mediation of SUSY breaking is dominated is found although there are many problematic bulk effects of SUSY breaking. A negative cosmological constant in the radius stabilized vacuum can be cancelled by a localized SUSY breaking. Making use of this localized SUSY breaking also solves the μ-problem by Giudice-Masiero mechanism. 
0808.04014	Evolutionary Model of Species Body Mass Diversification	Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)	Authors:Aaron Clauset, Sidney Redner	Abstract:  We present a quantitative model for the biological evolution of species body masses within large groups of related species, e.g., terrestrial mammals, in which body mass M evolves according to branching (speciation), multiplicative diffusion, and an extinction probability that increases logarithmically with mass. We describe this evolution in terms of a convection-diffusion-reaction equation for ln M. The steady-state behavior is in good agreement with empirical data on recent terrestrial mammals, and the time-dependent behavior also agrees with data on extinct mammal species between 95 - 50 Myr ago. 
0808.04015	The Visual Orbit of the 1.1-day Spectroscopic Binary σ^2 Coronae Borealis from Interferometry at the CHARA Array	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Deepak Raghavan, Harold A. McAlister, Guillermo Torres, David W. Latham, Brian D. Mason, Tabetha S. Boyajian, Ellyn K. Baines, Stephen J. Williams, Theo A. ten Brummelaar, Chris D. Farrington, Stephen T. Ridgway, Laszlo Sturmann, Judit Sturmann, Nils H. Turner	Abstract:  We present an updated spectroscopic orbit and a new visual orbit for the double-lined spectroscopic binary σ^2 Coronae Borealis based on radial velocity measurements at the Oak Ridge Observatory in Harvard, Massachusetts and interferometric visibility measurements at the CHARA Array on Mount Wilson. σ^2 CrB is composed of two Sun-like stars of roughly equal mass in a circularized orbit with a period of 1.14 days. The long baselines of the CHARA Array have allowed us to resolve the visual orbit for this pair, the shortest period binary yet resolved interferometrically, enabling us to determine component masses of 1.137 \pm 0.037 M_sun and 1.090 \pm 0.036 M_sun. We have also estimated absolute V-band magnitudes of MV (primary) = 4.35 \pm 0.02 and MV(secondary) = 4.74 \pm 0.02. A comparison with stellar evolution models indicates a relatively young age of 1-3 Gyr, consistent with the high Li abundance measured previously. This pair is the central component of a quintuple system, along with another similar-mass star, σ^1 CrB, in a ~ 730-year visual orbit, and a distant M-dwarf binary, σCrB C, at a projected separation of ~ 10 arcmin. We also present differential proper motion evidence to show that components C & D (ADS 9979C & D) listed for this system in the Washington Double Star Catalog are optical alignments that are not gravitationally bound to the σCrB system. 
0808.04016	Coarse-graining stochastic biochemical networks: quasi-stationary approximation and fast simulations using a stochastic path integral technique	Molecular Networks (q-bio.MN)	Authors:N. A. Sinitsyn, Nicolas Hengartner, Ilya Nemenman	Abstract:  We propose a universal approach for analysis and fast simulations of stiff stochastic biochemical kinetics networks, which rests on elimination of fast chemical species without a loss of information about mesoscopic, non-Poissonian fluctuations of the slow ones. Our approach, which is similar to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in quantum mechanics, follows from the stochastic path integral representation of the full counting statistics of reaction events (also known as the cumulant generating function). In applications with a small number of chemical reactions, this approach produces analytical expressions for moments of chemical fluxes between slow variables. This allows for a low-dimensional, interpretable representation of the biochemical system, that can be used for coarse-grained numerical simulation schemes with a small computational complexity and yet high accuracy. As an example, we consider a chain of biochemical reactions, derive its coarse-grained description, and show that the Gillespie simulations of the original stiff system, the coarse-grained simulations, and the full analytical treatment are in an agreement, but the coarse-grained simulations are three orders of magnitude faster than the Gillespie analogue.

Wang	Abstract:  A new method is proposed to calculate wave functions in $k_T$-factorization in \cite{LiMi} as a comment about our paper \cite{FMW}. We point out that the results obtained with the method are in conflict with the translation invariance and depend on the chosen contours for loop-integrals. Therefore, the method is in principle unacceptable and the results with the method cannot be correct. 
0808.04018	Interference of the evolutions of Rb and Na Bose-Einstein condensates	Atomic and Molecular Clusters (physics.atm-clus)	Authors:Ma Luo, Chengguang Bao, Zhibing Li	Abstract:  Spin evolution of a mixture of two species of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (Rb and Na) has been investigated beyond the mean field theory. Both analytical expression and numerical results on the populations of spin-components are obtained. The interference is found to depend on the initial states and the inter-species interaction sensitively. A number of phenomena arising from the interference have been predicted. In particular, periodic behavior and the alternate appearances of a zone of oscillation and a long quiet zone are found. 
0808.04019	The Hölder continuity of a class of 3-dimension ultraparabolic equations	Analysis of PDEs (math.AP)	Authors:Wang Wendong, Zhang Liqun	Abstract:  We obtained the $C^{\a}$ continuity for weak solutions of a class of ultraparabolic equations with measurable coefficients of the form $${\ptl_t u}= \ptl_x(a(x,y,t)\ptl_x u)+b_0(x,y,t)\ptl_x u+b(x,y,t)\ptl_y u,$$ which generalized our recent results on KFP equations.

The overall detection efficiency is estimated comparing the yields of resonance ionization and electron-impact ionization in the same QMS.

Nuclear spins are polarized and detected through the hyperfine interaction between a nuclear spin system and a two-dimensional electron system located at an interface of GaAs/AlGaAs single heterostructure. Coherent oscillations between the nuclear-spin quantum states are observed by measuring the longitudinal voltage of the conductor. 
0808.04022	Fundamental Dominations in Graphs	Combinatorics (math.CO)	Authors:Arash Behzad, Mehdi Behzad, Cheryl E. Praeger	Abstract:  Nine variations of the concept of domination in a simple graph are identified as fundamental domination concepts, and a unified approach is introduced for studying them. For each variation, the minimum cardinality of a subset of dominating elements is the corresponding fundamental domination number. It is observed that, for each nontrivial connected graph, at most five of these nine numbers can be different, and inequalities between these five numbers are given. Finally, these fundamental dominations are interpreted in terms of the total graph of the given graph, a concept introduced by the second author in 1965. It is argued that the very first domination concept, defined by O. Ore in 1962 and under a different name by C. Berge in 1958, deserves to be called the most fundamental of graph dominations. 
0808.04023	Search for pair production of second generation scalar leptoquarks	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:D0 Collaboration: V.M. Abazov, et al    	Abstract:  We report on a search for the pair production of second generation scalar leptoquarks (LQ) in ppbar collisions at the center of mass energy sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.0 fb-1 collected with the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. Topologies arising from the LQLQbar->muqnuq and LQLQbar->muqmuq decay modes are investigated. No excess of data over the standard model prediction is observed and upper limits on the leptoquark pair production cross section are derived at the 95% C.L. as a function of the leptoquark mass and the branching fraction beta for the decay LQ->muq. These are interpreted as lower limits on the leptoquark mass as a function of beta. For beta=1 (0.5), scalar second generation leptoquarks with masses up to 316 GeV (270 GeV) are excluded. 
0808.04024	The Center of Mass for Spatial Branching Processes and an Application for Self-Interaction	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Janos Englander	Abstract:  In this paper we prove that the center of mass of a supercritical branching-Brownian motion, or that of a supercritical super-Brownian motion tends to a limiting position almost surely, which, in a sense complements a result of Tribe on the final behavior of a critical super-Brownian motion. This is shown to be true also for a model where branching Brownian motion is modified by attraction/repulsion between particles. We then put this observation together with the description of the interacting system as viewed from its center of mass, and get the following asymptotic behavior: the system asymptotically becomes a branching Ornstein Uhlenbeck process (inward for attraction and outward for repulsion), but the origin is shifted to a random point which has normal distribution, and the Ornstein Uhlenbeck particles are not independent but constitute a system with a degree of freedom which is less by their number by precisely one. 
0808.04025	Interplay of frustration, magnetism, charge ordering, and covalency in a model of Na0.5CoO2	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Jaime Merino, B. J. Powell, Ross H. McKenzie	Abstract:  We investigate an effective Hamiltonian for Na0.5CoO2 that includes the electrostatic potential due to the ordered Na ions and strong electronic correlations. This model displays a subtle interplay between metallic and insulating phases and between charge and magnetic order. For realistic parameters, the model predicts an insulating phase with similarities to a covalent insulator. We show that this interpretation gives a consistent explanation of experiments on Na0.5CoO2, including the small degree of charge ordering, the small charge gap, the large moment, and the optical conductivity. 
0808.04026	Flavor structure with multi moduli in 5D SUGRA	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Hiroyuki Abe, Yutaka Sakamura	Abstract:  We investigate 5-dimensional supergravity on S^1/Z_2 with a physical Z_2-odd vector multiplet, which yields an additional modulus other than the radion. We find additional terms in the 4-dimensional effective theory that are peculiar to the multi moduli case. Such terms can make the soft masses are non-tachyonic and almost flavor-universal at tree-level, in contrast to the single modulus case. This provides a new possibility to solve the SUSY flavor problem. 
0808.04027	Regular projections of graphs with at most three double points	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Youngsik Huh, Ryo Nikkuni	Abstract:  A generic immersion of a planar graph into the 2-space is said to be knotted if there does not exist a trivial embedding of the graph into the 3-space obtained by lifting the immersion with respect to the natural projection from the 3-space to the 2-space. In this paper we show that if a generic immersion of a planar graph is knotted then the number of double points of the immersion is more than or equal to three. To prove this, we also show that an embedding of a graph obtained from a generic immersion of the graph (does not need to be planar) with at most three double points is totally free if it contains neither a Hopf link nor a trefoil knot.

0808.04030	The onset of superfluidity in capillary flow of liquid helium 4	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:Shun-ichiro Koh	Abstract:  The onset mechanism of superfluidity is examined by taking the case of the capillary flow of liquid helium 4. In the capillary flow, a substantial fall of the shear viscosity has been observed in the normal phase (lambda point<T<3.7K). In this temperature region, under the strong influence of Bose statistics, the coherent many-body wave function grows to an intermediate size between a macroscopic and a microscopic one, which is different from thermal fluctuation. We consider such a capillary flow by including it to a general picture that includes the flow of rotating helium 4 as well. Using the Kramers-Kronig relation, we express the inverse of the shear viscosity in terms of the generalized susceptibility of the system, and obtain a formula for the shear viscosity in the vicinity of the lambda point. Regarding bosons without the condensate as a non-perturbative state, we make a perturbation calculation of the susceptibility with respect to the repulsive interaction. With decreasing temperature from 3.7K, the growth of the coherent wave function gradually suppresses the shear viscosity, and makes the superfluid flow stable. Comparing formulas obtained to the experimental data, we estimate that the ratio of the superfluid density defined in the mechanical sense reaches 1/100000 just above the lambda point. 
0808.04031	Hybrid data regression modelling in measurement	Applications (stat.AP)	Authors:Vladimir B. Bokov	Abstract:  Measurement involves the determination of quantitative estimates of physical quantities from experiment, along with estimates of their associated uncertainties. Herewith an experimental system model is the key to extracting information from the experimental data. The measurement information obtained depends directly on the quality of the model. With this concern novel regression modelling techniques have been fashioned by data integration from computer-simulation and physical designed experiments. These techniques have allowed attaining the advanced level of model completeness, parsimony, and precision via approximation of the exact unknown model by mathematical product of available theoretical and appropriate empirical functions. The purpose of this approximation is to represent adequately the true model on the considered region of factor space with all advantages of theoretical modelling. This allows a further focus on the measurement science of issue. Pneumatic gauge hybrid data candidate model building, solving and validation reviled that such adequate models permit to attain minimum discrepancy from empirical evidence. 
0808.04032	Karl Pearson's Theoretical Errors and the Advances They Inspired	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:Stephen M. Stigler	Abstract:  Karl Pearson played an enormous role in determining the content and organization of statistical research in his day, through his research, his teaching, his establishment of laboratories, and his initiation of a vast publishing program. His technical contributions had initially and continue today to have a profound impact upon the work of both applied and theoretical statisticians, partly through their inadequately acknowledged influence upon Ronald A. Fisher. Particular attention is drawn to two of Pearson's major errors that nonetheless have left a positive and lasting impression upon the statistical world. 
0808.04033	The anisotropy of two dimensional percolation clusters of self-affine models	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Fatemeh Ebrahimi	Abstract:  The anisotropy parameter of two-dimensional equilibrium clusters of site percolation process in long-range self-affine correlated structures are studied numerically. We use a fractional Brownian Motion(FBM) statistic to produce both persistent and anti-persistent long-range correlations in 2-D models. It is seen that self affinity makes the shape of percolation clusters slightly more isotropic. Moreover, we find that the sign of correction to scaling term is determined by the nature of correlation. For persistent correlation the correction to scaling term adds a negative contribution to the anisotropy of percolation clusters, while for the anti-persistent case it is positive. 
0808.04034	Classical energy momentum tensor renormalisation via effective field theory methods	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Umberto Cannella, Riccardo Sturani (University of Geneva)    	Abstract:  We apply the Effective Field Theory approach to General Relativity, introduced by Goldberger and Rothstein, to study point-like and string-like sources in the context of scalar-tensor theories of gravity. Within this framework we compute the classical energy-momentum tensor renormalization to first Post-Newtonian order or, in the case of extra scalar fields, up to first order in the (non-derivative) trilinear interaction terms: this allows to write down the corrections to the standard (Newtonian) gravitational potential and to the extra-scalar potential. In the case of one-dimensional extended sources we give an alternative derivation of the renormalization of the string tension enabling a re-analysis of the discrepancy between the results obtained by Dabholkar and Harvey in one paper and by Buonanno and Damour in another, already discussed in the latter. 
0808.04035	Sur l'homologie des groupes orthogonaux et symplectiques à coefficients tordus	Algebraic Topology (math.AT)	Authors:Aurélien Djament (LMJL), Christine Vespa (IRMA)    	Abstract:  We compute the stable homology of orthogonal and symplectic groups over a finite field k with coefficients coming from an usual endofunctor F of k-vector spaces (exterior, symmetric, divided powers...), that is, for all natural integer i, we compute the colimits of the vector spaces $H_i(O_{n,n}(k) ; F(k^{2n}))$ and $H_i(Sp_{2n}(k) ; F(k^{2n}))$. In this situation, the stabilization is a classical result of Charney. We give a formal framework to connect stable homology of some families of groups and homology of suitable small categories thanks to a spectral sequence which collapses in several cases. By our purely algebraic methods (i.e. without stable K-theory) we obtain again results of Betley for stable homology of linear groups and symmetric groups. For orthogonal and symplectic groups over a field we prove a categorical result for vector spaces equipped with quadratic or alternating forms and use powerful cancellation results known in homology of functors (Suslin, Scorichenko, Djament) to deduce a spectacular simplification of the second sheet of our general spectral sequence. When we consider the orthogonal and symplectic groups over a finite field and we take coefficients with values in vector spaces over the same field, we can compute the second sheet of the spectral sequence thanks to classical results: homological cancellation with trivial coefficients (Quillen, Fiedorowicz-Priddy) and calculation of torsion groups between usual functors (Franjou-Friedlander-Scorichenko-Suslin, Chalupnik). 
0808.04036	Theory for the phase behaviour of a colloidal fluid with competing interactions	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:A.J. Archer, C. Ionescu, D. Pini, L. Reatto	Abstract:  We study the phase behaviour of a fluid composed of particles which interact via a pair potential that is repulsive for large inter-particle distances, is attractive at intermediate distances and is strongly repulsive at short distances (the particles have a hard core). As well as exhibiting gas-liquid phase separation, this system also exhibits phase transitions from the uniform fluid phases to modulated inhomogeneous fluid phases. Starting from a microscopic density functional theory, we develop an order parameter theory for the phase transition in order to examine in detail the phase behaviour. The amplitude of the density modulations is the order parameter in our theory. The theory predicts that the phase transition from the uniform to the modulated fluid phase can be either first order or second order (continuous). The phase diagram exhibits two tricritical points, joined to one another by the line of second order transitions. 
0808.04037	Coexistence of superconductivity and charge-density waves in a two-dimensional Holstein model at half-filling	Superconductivity (cond-mat.supr-con)	Authors:S. Sykora, A. Hübsch, K. W. Becker	Abstract:  In one dimension the coupling of electrons to phonons leads to a transition from a metallic to a Peierls distorted insulated state if the coupling exceeds a critical value. On the other hand, in two dimensions the electron-phonon interaction may also lead to the formation of Cooper pairs. This competition of superconductivity and charge order (in conjunction with a lattice distortion) is studied in this letter by means of the projector-based renormalization method (PRM). Increasing the electron-phonon interaction, we find a crossover behavior between a purely superconducting state and a charge-density wave where a well-defined parameter range of coexistence of superconductivity and lattice distortion exists. 
0808.04038	Closed Magnetic Geodesics on $S^2$	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Matthias Schneider	Abstract:  We give existence results for simple closed curves with prescribed geodesic curvature on $S^{2}$, which correspond to periodic orbits of a charge in a magnetic field. 
0808.04039	Anderson transition in a three dimensional kicked rotor	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:Jiao Wang, Antonio M. Garcia-Garcia	Abstract:  We investigate Anderson localization in a three dimensional (3d) kicked rotor. By a finite size scaling analysis we have identified a mobility edge for a certain value of the kicking strength $k = k_c$. For $k > k_c$ dynamical localization does not occur, all eigenstates are delocalized and the spectral correlations are well described by Wigner-Dyson statistics. This can be understood by mapping the kicked rotor problem onto a 3d Anderson model (AM) where a band of metallic states exists for sufficiently weak disorder. Around the critical region $k \approx k_c$ we have carried out a detailed study of the level statistics and quantum diffusion. In agreement with the predictions of the one parameter scaling theory (OPT) and with previous numerical simulations of a 3d AM at the transition, the number variance is linear, level repulsion is still observed and quantum diffusion is anomalous with $<p^2 > \propto t^{2/3}$. We note that in the 3d kicked rotor the dynamics is not random but deterministic. In order to estimate the differences between these two situations we have studied a 3d kicked rotor in which the kinetic term of the associated evolution matrix is random. A detailed numerical comparison shows that the differences between the two cases are relatively small. However in the deterministic case only a small set of irrational periods was used. A qualitative analysis of a much larger set suggests that the deviations between the random and the deterministic kicked rotor can be important for certain choices of periods. Contrary to intuition correlations in the deterministic case can either suppress or enhance Anderson localization effects. 
0808.04040	The hidden HI-massive LIRG HIZOA J0836-43: Inside-out galaxy formation	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. E. Cluver, T. H. Jarrett, P. N. Appleton, R. C. Kraan-Korteweg, P. A. Woudt, B. S. Koribalski, J. L. Donley, K. Wakamatsu, T. Nagayama	Abstract:  HIZOA J0836-43 is an extreme gas-rich ($M_{\rm{HI}}$=7.5$\times10^{10} M_{\sun}$) disk galaxy which lies hidden behind the strongly obscuring Vela region of the Milky Way. Utilizing observations from the {\it Spitzer Space Telescope}, we have found it to be a luminous infrared starburst galaxy with a star formation rate of $\sim 21 M_{\sun} \rm{yr^{-1}}$, arising from exceptionally strong molecular PAH emission ($L_{7.7\micron} = 1.50 \times 10^{9} L_{\odot}$) and far-infrared emission from cold dust. The galaxy exhibits a weak mid-infrared continuum compared to other starforming galaxies and U/LIRGs. This relative lack of emission from small grains suggests atypical interstellar medium conditions compared to other starbursts. We do not detect significant $[$Ne {\sc v}$]$ or $[$O {\sc iv}$]$, which implies an absent or very weak AGN. The galaxy possesses a prominent bulge of evolved stars and a stellar mass of 4.4($\pm$1.4)$\times10^{10} M_{\sun}$. With its plentiful gas supply and current star formation rate, a doubling of stellar mass would occur on a timescale of $\sim$2 Gyr. Compared to local galaxies, HIZOA J0836-43 appears to be a "scaled-up" spiral undergoing inside-out formation, possibly resembling stellar disk building processes at intermediate redshifts.

0808.04042	Statistical models, likelihood, penalized likelihood and hierarchical likelihood	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Daniel Commenges	Abstract:  We give an overview of statistical models and likelihood, together with two of its variants: penalized and hierarchical likelihood. The Kullback-Leibler divergence is referred to repeatedly, for defining the misspecification risk of a model, for grounding the likelihood and the likelihood crossvalidation which can be used for choosing weights in penalized likelihood. Families of penalized likelihood and sieves estimators are shown to be equivalent. The similarity of these likelihood with a posteriori distributions in a Bayesian approach is considered.

0808.04044	Probing the low-luminosity GRB population with new generation satellite detectors	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Imerito, D. Coward, R. Burman, D. Blair	Abstract:  We compare the detection rates and redshift distributions of low-luminosity (LL) GRBs localized by Swift with those expected to be observed by the new generation satellite detectors on GLAST (now Fermi) and, in future, EXIST. Although the GLAST burst telescope will be less sensitive than Swift's in the 15--150 keV band, its large field-of-view implies that it will double Swift's detection rate of LL bursts. We show that Swift, GLAST and EXIST should detect about 1, 2 & 30 LL GRBs, respectively, over a 5-year operational period. The burst telescope on EXIST should detect LL GRBs at a rate of more than an order of magnitude greater than that of Swift's BAT. We show that the detection horizon for LL GRBs will be extended from $z \simeq 0.4$ for Swift to $z \simeq 1.1$ in the EXIST era. Also, the contribution of LL bursts to the observed GRB redshift distribution will contribute to an identifiable feature in the distribution at $z \simeq 1$. 
0808.04045	Role of Three-Qubit Mixed-States Entanglement in Teleportation Scheme	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:DaeKil Park, Sayatnova Tamaryan, Jin-Woo Son	Abstract:  The bipartite quantum teleportation with a three-qubit mixture of GHZ and W states as a quantum channel is discussed. When the quantum channel is a mixed state consisting of the GHZ state plus small perturbed W state, the entanglement of the channel becomes zero when the average fidelity $\bar{F}_{GHZ}$ is less than 0.775. This means that the mixed state cannot play an any role as a quantum channel at $\bar{F}_{GHZ} \leq 0.775$. For the case of the mixed state consisting of the W state plus small perturbed GHZ state it turn out that this mixed state cannot play a role as a quantum channel at $\bar{F}_W \leq 0.833$. 
0808.04046	Inverse Monte-Carlo and Demon Methods for Effective Polyakov Loop Models of SU(N)-YM	High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat)	Authors:Christian Wozar, Tobias Kaestner, Bjoern H. Wellegehausen, Andreas Wipf, Thomas Heinzl	Abstract:  We study effective Polyakov loop models for SU(N) Yang-Mills theories at finite temperature. In particular effective models for SU(3) YM with an additional adjoint Polyakov loop potential are considered. The rich phase structure including a center and anti-center directed phase is reproduced with an effective model utilizing the inverse Monte-Carlo method. The demon method as a possibility to obtain the effective models' couplings is compared to the method of Schwinger-Dyson equations. Thermalization effects of microcanonical and canonical demon method are analyzed. Finally the elaborate canonical demon method is applied to the finite temperature SU(4) YM phase transition. 
0808.04047	Early Abnormal Temperature Structure of X-ray Looptop Source of Solar Flares	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Jinhua Shen, Tuanhui Zhou, Haisheng Ji, Na Wang, Wenda Cao, Haimin Wang	Abstract:  This Letter is to investigate the physics of a newly discovered phenomenon -- contracting flare loops in the early phase of solar flares. In classical flare models, which were constructed based on the phenomenon of expansion of flare loops, an energy releasing site is put above flare loops. These models can predict that there is a vertical temperature gradient in the top of flare loops due to heat conduction and cooling effects. Therefore, the centroid of an X-ray looptop source at higher energy bands will be higher in altitude, for which we can define as normal temperature distribution. With observations made by {\it RHESSI}, we analyzed 10 M- or X-class flares (9 limb flares). For all these flares, the movement of looptop sources shows an obvious U-shaped trajectory, which we take as the signature of contraction-to-expansion of flare loops. We find that, for all these flares, normal temperature distribution does exist, but only along the path of expansion. The temperature distribution along the path of contraction is abnormal, showing no spatial order at all. The result suggests that magnetic reconnection processes in the contraction and expansion phases of these solar flares are different. 
0808.04048	Two-dimensional fluid with competing interactions exhibiting microphase separation: theory for bulk and interfacial properties	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:A.J. Archer	Abstract:  Colloidal particles that are confined to an interface such as the air-water interface are an example of a two-dimensional fluid. Such dispersions have been observed to spontaneously form cluster and stripe morphologies in certain systems with isotropic pair potentials between the particles, due to the fact that the pair interaction between the colloids has competing attraction and repulsion over different length scales. Here we present a simple density functional theory for a model of such a two-dimensional fluid. The theory predicts a bulk phase diagram exhibiting cluster, stripe and bubble modulated phases, in addition to homogeneous fluid phases. Comparing with simulation results for this model from the literature, we find that the theory is qualitatively reliable. The model allows for a detailed investigation of the structure of the fluid and we are able to obtain simple approximate expressions for the static structure factor and for the length scale characterising the modulations in the microphase separated phases. We also investigate the behaviour of the system under confinement between two parallel hard walls. We find that the confined fluid phase behaviour can be rather complex. 
0808.04049	The Unitary Implementation of a Measured Quantum Groupoid action	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Michel Enock	Abstract:  Mimicking the von Neumann version of Kustermans and Vaes' locally compact quantum groups, Franck Lesieur had introduced a notion of measured quantum groupoid, in the setting of von Neumann algebras. In a former article, the author had introduced the notion of actions, crossed-product, dual actions of a measured quantum groupoid: a biduality theorem for actions had been proved. This article continues that program : we prove the existence of a standard implementation for an action, and a bidulaity theorem for weights. We generalize this way results which were proved, for locally compact quantum groups by S. Vaes, and for measured groupoids by T. Yamanouchi. 
0808.04050	Optimizing the double description method for normal surface enumeration	Geometric Topology (math.GT)	Authors:Benjamin A. Burton	Abstract:  Many key algorithms in 3-manifold topology involve the enumeration of normal surfaces, which is based upon the double description method for finding the vertices of a convex polytope. Typically we are only interested in a small subset of these vertices, thus opening the way for substantial optimization. Here we give an account of the vertex enumeration problem as it applies to normal surfaces, and present new optimizations that yield strong improvements in both running time and memory consumption. The resulting algorithms are tested using the freely available software package Regina. 
0808.04051	Honest variable selection in linear and logistic regression models via $\ell_1$ and $\ell_1+\ell_2$ penalization	Statistics Theory (math.ST)	Authors:Florentina Bunea	Abstract:  This paper investigates correct variable selection in finite samples via $\ell_1$ and $\ell_1+\ell_2$ type penalization schemes. The asymptotic consistency of variable selection immediately follows from this analysis. We focus on logistic and linear regression models. The following questions are central to our paper: given a level of confidence $1-δ$, under which assumptions on the design matrix, for which strength of the signal and for what values of the tuning parameters can we identify the true model at the given level of confidence? Formally, if $\widehat{I}$ is an estimate of the true variable set $I^*$, we study conditions under which $\mathbb{P}(\widehat{I}=I^*)\geq 1-δ$, for a given sample size $n$, number of parameters $M$ and confidence $1-δ$. We show that in identifiable models, both methods can recover coefficients of size $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, up to small multiplicative constants and logarithmic factors in $M$ and $\frac{1}δ$. The advantage of the $\ell_1+\ell_2$ penalization over the $\ell_1$ is minor for the variable selection problem, for the models we consider here. Whereas the former estimates are unique, and become more stable for highly correlated data matrices as one increases the tuning parameter of the $\ell_2$ part, too large an increase in this parameter value may preclude variable selection. 
0808.04052	Measured quantum groupoids with a central basis	Operator Algebras (math.OA)	Authors:Michel Enock	Abstract:  Mimicking the von Neumann version of Kustermans and Vaes' locally compact quantum groups, Franck Lesieur had introduced a notion of measured quantum groupoid, in the setting of von Neumann algebras. In this article, we suppose that the basis of the measured quantum groupoid is central; in that case, we prove that a specific sub-${\bf C}^*$ algebra is invariant under all the data of the measured quantum groupoid; moreover, this sub-${\bf C}^*$-algebra is a continuous field of ${\bf C}^*$-algebras; when the basis is central in both the measured quantum groupoid and its dual, we get that the measured quantum groupoid is a continuous field of locally compact quantum groups. On the other hand, using this sub-${\bf C}^*$-algebra, we prove that any abelian measured quantum groupoid comes from a locally compact groupoid.

Verrecchia, P. Giommi, L. A. Antonelli, S. Colafrancesco, L. Salotti	Abstract:  We report the gamma-ray activity from the intermediate BL Lac S5 0716+714 during observations acquired by the AGILE satellite in September and October 2007. These detections of activity were contemporaneous with a period of intense optical activity, which was monitored by GASP-WEBT. This simultaneous optical and gamma-ray coverage allows us to study in detail the light curves, time lags, gamma-ray photon spectrum, and Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) during different states of activity. AGILE observed the source with its two co-aligned imagers, the Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) and the hard X-ray imager (Super-AGILE), which are sensitive to the 30 MeV-50 GeV and 18-60 keV energy ranges, respectively. Observations were completed in two different periods, the first between 2007 September 4-23, and the second between 2007 October 24-November 1. Over the period 2007 September 7-12, AGILE detected gamma-ray emission from the source at a significance level of 9.6-sigma with an average flux (E>100 MeV) of (97 +/- 15) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1}, which increased by a factor of at least four within three days. No emission was detected by Super-AGILE for the energy range 18-60 keV to a 3-sigma upper limit of 10 mCrab in 335 ksec. In October 2007, AGILE repointed toward S5 0716+714 following an intense optical flare, measuring an average flux of (47 +/- 11) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} at a significance level of 6.0-sigma. The gamma-ray flux of S5 0716+714 detected by AGILE is the highest ever detected for this blazar and one of the most intense gamma-ray fluxes detected from a BL Lac object. The SED of mid-September appears to be consistent with the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission model, but only by including two SSC components of different variabilities. 
0808.04054	Dynamic Response of Block Copolymer Wormlike Micelles to Shear Flow	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:B. Lonetti, J. Kohlbrecher, L. Willner, J. K. G. Dhont, M. P. Lettinga	Abstract:  The linear and non-linear dynamic response to an oscillatory shear flow of giant wormlike micelles consisting of Pb-Peo block copolymers is studied by means of Fourier transform rheology. Experiments are performed in the vicinity of the isotropic-nematic phase transition concentration, where the location of isotropic-nematic phase transition lines is determined independently. Strong shear-thinning behaviour is observed due to critical slowing down of orientational diffusion as a result of the vicinity of the isotropic- nematic spinodal. This severe shear-thinning behaviour is shown to result in gradient shear banding. Time-resolved Small angle neutron scattering experiments are used to obtain insight in the microscopic phenomena that underly the observed rheological response. An equation of motion for the order-parameter tensor and an expression of the stress tensor in terms of the order-parameter tensor are used to interpret the experimental data, both in the linear and non-linear regime. Scaling of the dynamic behaviour of the orientational order parameter and the stress is found when critical slowing down due to the vicinity of the isotropic-nematic spinodal is accounted for. 
0808.04055	Age determination of possible binary open clusters NGC 2383/NGC 2384 and Pismis 6/Pismis 8	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Valentin Kopchev, Petko Nedialkov, Georgy Petrov	Abstract:  Based on 2MASS J and Ks photometry for the open star clusters NGC 2383, NGC 2384,Pismis 6, Pismis 8 and using color magnitude diagrams with isochrones fit, we found an age of $\log ({age})$ = 8.3 (200 $\pm$ 6 Myr) for NGC 2383 and $\log ({age})$ = 6.9 (8 $\pm$ 6 Myr) for NGC 2384. For Pismis 6 and Pismis 8 we adopted a range of $\log ({age})$ = 6 - 7 (1 - 10 Myr). Because they similar ages, Pismis 6 and Pismis 8 may have been formed in the same Giant Molecular Cloud, and we concluded they are a good candidate for a binary system. In the case of NGC 2383 and NGC 2384, because the big age difference found we conclude that most probably they are born in different environments and as well are not physically connected. 
0808.04056	Black hole entropy for the general area spectrum	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Tomo Tanaka, Takashi Tamaki	Abstract:  We consider the possibility that the horizon area is expressed by the general area spectrum in loop quantum gravity and calculate the black hole entropy by counting the degrees of freedom in spin-network states related to its area. Although the general area spectrum has a complex expression, we succeeded in obtaining the result that the black hole entropy is proportional to its area as in previous works where the simplified area formula has been used. This gives new values for the Barbero-Immirzi parameter ($γ=0.5802... \mathrm{or} 0.7847...$) which are larger than that of previous works. 
0808.04057	Sparse sampling: Spatial design for monitoring stream networks	Methodology (stat.ME)	Authors:Melissa J. Dobbie, Brent L. Henderson, Don L. Stevens Jr	Abstract:  Spatial designs for monitoring stream networks, especially ephemeral systems, are typically non-standard, `sparse' and can be very complex, reflecting the complexity of the ecosystem being monitored, the scale of the population, and the competing multiple monitoring objectives. The main purpose of this paper is to present a review of approaches to spatial design to enable informed decisions to be made about developing practical and optimal spatial designs for future monitoring of streams.

In the second part, we define under some assumptions a motivic Tamagawa number and show that it specializes to the Tamagawa number introduced by Peyre in the context of Manin's conjectures about rational points of bounded height on Fano varieties. 
0808.04059	Any sub-Riemannian Metric has Points of Smoothness	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Andrei Agrachev	Abstract:  We prove the result stated in the title; it is equivalent to the existence of a regular point of the sub-Riemannian exponential mapping. We also prove that the metric is analytic on an open everywhere dense subset in the case of a complete real-analytic sub-Riemannian manifold. 
0808.04060	TrustMAS: Trusted Communication Platform for Multi-Agent Systems	Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)	Authors:Krzysztof Szczypiorski, Igor Margasinski, Wojciech Mazurczyk, Krzysztof Cabaj, Pawel Radziszewski	Abstract:  The paper presents TrustMAS - Trusted Communication Platform for Multi-Agent Systems, which provides trust and anonymity for mobile agents. The platform includes anonymous technique based on random-walk algorithm for providing general purpose anonymous communication for agents. All agents, which take part in the proposed platform, benefit from trust and anonymity that is provided for their interactions. Moreover, in TrustMAS there are StegAgents (SA) that are able to perform various steganographic communication. To achieve that goal, SAs may use methods in different layers of TCP/IP model or specialized middleware enabling steganography that allows hidden communication through all layers of mentioned model. In TrustMAS steganographic channels are used to exchange routing tables between StegAgents. Thus all StegAgents in TrustMAS with their ability to exchange information by using hidden channels form distributed steganographic router (Stegrouter). 
0808.04061	Frequency Metrology on single trapped ions in the weak binding limit: The 3s1/2-3p3/2 transition in 24-Mg+	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:M. Herrmann, V. Batteiger, S. Knünz, G. Saathoff, Th. Udem, T.W. Hänsch	Abstract:  We demonstrate a method for precision spectroscopy on trapped ions in the limit of unresolved motional sidebands. By sympathetic cooling of a chain of crystallized ions we suppress adverse temperature variations induced by the spectroscopy laser that usually lead to a distorted line profle and obtain a Voigt profile with negligible distortions. We applied the method to measure the absolute frequency of the astrophysically relevant D2 transition in single 24-Mg+ ions and find 1072082934.33(16)MHz, a nearly 400fold improvement over previous results. Further, we find the excited state lifetime to be 3.84(10) ns. 
0808.04062	Ensembles related to the rich-club coefficient for non-evolving networks	Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)	Authors:R. J. Mondragon, S. Zhou	Abstract:  In complex networks the rich nodes are the subset of nodes with high degree. These well connected nodes tend to dominate the organisation of the network's structure. In non-evolving networks, a reference network has been used to detect if the connectivity between the rich nodes is due to chance or caused by an unknown mechanism. Chance is represented as a reference network obtained from an ensemble of networks. When compared with the original network the reference network discounts suggests the existence of a well connected rich club beyond structural constraints. Here we revise some of the properties of the ensemble obtained by conserving only the degree distribution and introduce two new reference networks to study the importance of the rich nodes as organisers of the network structure. The first reference network is obtained from an ensemble of networks where all the members of the ensemble have the same rich--club coefficient. The reference network obtained from the ensemble is assortative. We propose that this reference network can be used to study networks where assortativness is a fundamental property, a common case in many social networks. The second reference network is obtained from an ensemble where the members of the ensemble all have the same probability degree distribution and rich-club coefficient. The reference network obtained from this ensemble has a very similar structure to the original network. This ensemble can be used to quantify correlations between the rich nodes and pinpoint which links are the backbone of the network's structure. 
0808.04063	Magnetic Order in Kondo-Lattice Systems due to Electron-Electron Interactions	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Bernd Braunecker, Pascal Simon, Daniel Loss	Abstract:  The hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and the nuclear spins is one of the main sources of decoherence for spin qubits when the nuclear spins are disordered. An ordering of the latter largely suppresses this source of decoherence. Here we show that such an ordering can occur through a thermodynamic phase transition in two-dimensional (2D) Kondo-lattice type systems. We specifically focus on nuclear spins embedded in a 2D electron gas. The nuclear spins interact with each other through the RKKY interaction, which is carried by the electron gas. We show that a nuclear magnetic order at finite temperature relies on the anomalous behavior of the 2D static electron spin susceptibility due to electron-electron interactions. This provides a connection between low-dimensional magnetism and non-analyticities in interacting 2D electron systems. We discuss the conditions for nuclear magnetism, and show that the associated Curie temperature increases with the electron-electron interactions and may reach up into the millikelvin regime. The further reduction of dimensionality to one dimension is shortly discussed. 
0808.04064	Reprocessing of X-rays in the outer accretion disc of the black hole binary XTE J1817--330	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Marek Gierlinski, Chris Done, Kim Page	Abstract:  We build a simple model of the optical/UV emission from irradiation of the outer disc by the inner disc and coronal emission in black hole binaries. We apply this to the broadband Swift data from the outburst of the black hole binary XTE J1817--330 to confirm previous results that the optical/UV emission in the soft state is consistent with a reprocessing a constant fraction of the bolometric X-ray luminosity. However, this is very surprising as the disc temperature drops by more than a factor 3 in the soft state, which should produce a marked change in the reprocessing efficiency. The easiest way to match the observed constant reprocessed fraction is for the disc skin to be highly ionized (as suggested 30 years ago by van Paradijs), so that the bulk of the disc flux is reflected and only the hardest X-rays heat the disc. The constant reprocessed fraction also favours direct illumination of the disc over a scattering origin as the optical depth/solid angle of any scattering material (wind/corona) over the disc should decrease as the source luminosity declines. By contrast, the reprocessed fraction increases very significantly (by a factor ~6) as the source enters the hard state. This dramatic change is not evident from X-ray/UV flux correlations as it is masked by bandpass effects. However, it does not necessarily signal a change in emission e.g. the emergence of the jet dominating the optical/UV flux as the reflection albedo must change with the dramatic change in spectral shape. 
0808.04065	Mass measurements in the vicinity of the rp-process and the nu p-process paths with JYFLTRAP and SHIPTRAP	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:C. Weber, V.-V. Elomaa, R. Ferrer, C. Fröhlich, D. Ackermann, J. Äystö, G. Audi, L. Batist, K. Blaum, M. Block, A. Chaudhuri, M. Dworschak, S. Eliseev, T. Eronen, U. Hager, J. Hakala, F. Herfurth, F.P. Heßberger, S. Hofmann, A.

Rauth, J. Rissanen, D. Rodríguez, A. Saastamoinen, C. Scheidenberger, L. Schweikhard, D.M. Seliverstov, T. Sonoda, F.-K. Thielemann, P.G. Thirolf, G.K. Vorobjev	Abstract:  The masses of very neutron-deficient nuclides close to the astrophysical rp- and nu p-process paths have been determined with the Penning trap facilities JYFLTRAP at JYFL/Jyväskylä and SHIPTRAP at GSI/Darmstadt. Isotopes from yttrium (Z = 39) to palladium (Z = 46) have been produced in heavy-ion fusion-evaporation reactions. In total 21 nuclides were studied and almost half of the mass values were experimentally determined for the first time: 88Tc, 90-92Ru, 92-94Rh, and 94,95Pd. For the 95Pdm, (21/2^+) high-spin state, a first direct mass determination was performed. Relative mass uncertainties of typically $δm / m = 5 \times 10^{-8}$ were obtained. The impact of the new mass values has been studied in nu p-process nucleosynthesis calculations. The resulting reaction flow and the final abundances are compared to those obtained with the data of the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2003. 
0808.04066	The Ground State Energy of Dilute Bose Gas in Potentials with Positive Scattering Length	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Jun Yin	Abstract:  The leading term of the ground state energy/particle of a dilute gas of bosons with mass $m$ in the thermodynamic limit is $2π\hbar^2 a ρ/m$ when the density of the gas is $ρ$, the interaction potential is non-negative and the scattering length $a$ is positive. In this paper, we generalize the upper bound part of this result to any interaction potential with positive scattering length, i.e, $a>0$ and the lower bound part to some interaction potentials with shallow and/or narrow negative parts. 
0808.04067	The diameter of sparse random graphs	Probability (math.PR)	Authors:Oliver Riordan, Nicholas Wormald	Abstract:  In this paper we study the diameter of the random graph $G(n,p)$, i.e., the the largest finite distance between two vertices, for a wide range of functions $p=p(n)$. For $p=\la/n$ with $\la>1$ constant, we give a simple proof of an essentially best possible result, with an $O_p(1)$ additive correction term. Using similar techniques, we establish 2-point concentration in the case that $np\to\infty$. For $p=(1+ε)/n$ with $ε\to 0$, we obtain a corresponding result that applies all the way down to the scaling window of the phase transition, with an $O_p(1/ε)$ additive correction term whose (appropriately scaled) limiting distribution we describe. Combined with earlier results, our new results complete the determination of the diameter of the random graph $G(n,p)$ to an accuracy of the order of its standard deviation (or better), for all functions $p=p(n)$. Throughout we use branching process methods, rather than the more common approach of separate analysis of the 2-core and the trees attached to it.

Goss in [Applications of non-Archimedean integration to the $L$-series of $τ$-sheaves, {\em J. Number Theory,} 110 (2005), no. 1, 83--113] by proving that the group of locally analytic endomorphisms on the 1-units of a locally compact field of characteristic $p>0$ is isomorphic to the $p$-adic integers.

0808.04071	Factoriality of complete intersection threefolds	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Dimitra Kosta	Abstract:  Let X be a complete intersection of two hypersurfaces F_n and F_k in the projective space P^5 of degree n and k respectively with n >= k, such that the singularities of X are nodal and F_k is smooth. We prove that if the threefold X has at most (n+k-2)(n-1)-1 singular points, then it is factorial. 
0808.04072	Hyperconjugative Effect on the Electronic Wavefunctions of Ethanol	Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)	Authors:Xiangjun Chen (*), Fang Wu, Mi Yan, Hai-Bei Li, Shan Xi Tian*, Xu Shan, Kedong Wang, Zhongjun Li, Kezun Xu	Abstract:  Hyperconjugation is a basic conception of chemistry. Its straightforward effect is exhibited by the spatial delocalization characteristics of the electron density distributions or wavefunctions. Such effects on the electron wavefunctions of the highest-occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) of two ethanol conformers are demonstrated with electron momentum spectroscopy together with natural bond orbital analyses, exhibiting the distinctly different symmetries of the HOMO wavefunctions in momentum space. 
0808.04073	Longitudinal SDW order in a quasi-1D Ising-like quantum antiferromagnet	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:S. Kimura, M. Matsuda, T. Masuda, S. Hondo, K. Kaneko, N. Metoki, M. Hagiwara, T. Takeuchi, K. Okunishi, Z. He, K. Kindo, T. Taniyama, M. Itoh	Abstract:  From neutron diffraction measurements on a quasi-1D Ising-like Co$^{\rm 2+}$ spin compound BaCo$_{\rm 2}$V$_{\rm 2}$O$_{\rm 8}$, we observed an appearance of a novel type of incommensurate ordering in magnetic fields. This ordering is essentially different from the N{\' e}el-type ordering, which is expected for the classical system, and is caused by quantum fluctuation inherent in the quantum spin chain. A Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) nature characteristic of the gapless quantum 1D system is responsible for the realization of the incommensurate ordering. 
0808.04074	Persistence in the zero-temperature dynamics of the $Q$-states Potts model on undirected-directed Barabási-Albert networks and Erdös-Rényi random graphs	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:F. P. Fernandes, F.W.S. Lima	Abstract:  The zero-temperature Glauber dynamics is used to investigate the persistence probability $P(t)$ in the Potts model with $Q=3,4,5,7,9,12,24,64, 128$, $256, 512, 1024,4096,16384 $,..., $2^{30}$ states on {\it directed} and {\it undirected} Barabási-Albert networks and Erdös-Rényi random graphs. In this model it is found that $P(t)$ decays exponentially to zero in short times for {\it directed} and {\it undirected} Erdös-Rényi random graphs. For {\it directed} and {\it undirected} Barabási-Albert networks, in contrast it decays exponentially to a constant value for long times, i.e, $P(\infty)$ is different from zero for all $Q$ values (here studied) from $Q=3,4,5,..., 2^{30}$; this shows "blocking" for all these $Q$ values. Except that for $Q=2^{30}$ in the {\it undirected} case $P(t)$ tends exponentially to zero; this could be just a finite-size effect since in the other "blocking" cases you may have only a few unchanged spins. 
0808.04075	Unparticle signals with a few particles	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Manuel Perez-Victoria	Abstract:  We use Pade approximants to systematically approximate scalar unparticle propagators and their associated phase factors by a finite number of ordinary particles. This is possible for conformal dimensions 1<d<2, and also for d>2 if we add local terms. A small number of particles can, in some cases, mimic unparticle signals. We also discuss how the approximants capture basic unparticle properties. 
0808.04076	Lectures on Gauged Supergravity and Flux Compactifications	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Henning Samtleben	Abstract:  The low-energy effective theories describing string compactifications in the presence of fluxes are so-called gauged supergravities: deformations of the standard abelian supergravity theories. The deformation parameters can be identified with the various possible (geometric and non-geometric) flux components. In these lecture notes we review the construction of gauged supergravities in a manifestly duality covariant way and illustrate the construction in several examples. 
0808.04077	Association of ultracold double-species bosonic molecules	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:C. Weber, G. Barontini, J. Catani, G. Thalhammer, M. Inguscio, F. Minardi	Abstract:  We report on the creation of heterospecies bosonic molecules, associated from an ultracold Bose-Bose mixture of 41K and 87Rb, by using a resonantly modulated magnetic field close to two Feshbach resonances. We measure the binding energy of the weakly bound molecular states versus the Feshbach field and compare our results to theoretical predictions. We observe the broadening and asymmetry of the association spectrum due to thermal distribution of the atoms, and a frequency shift occurring when the binding energy depends nonlinearly on the Feshbach field. A simple model is developed to quantitatively describe the association process. Our work marks an important step forward in the experimental route towards Bose-Einstein condensates of dipolar molecules. 
0808.04078	On collisions driven negative energy waves and Weibel instability of a relativistic electron beam in a quasi-neutral plasma	Plasma Physics (physics.plasm-ph)	Authors:Anupam Karmakar, Naveen Kumar, Gennady Shvets, Oleg Polomarov, Alexander Pukhov	Abstract:  A new quasi-neutral model describing the Weibel instability of a high-current relativistic beam propagating through a resistive plasma is developed. It treats beam electrons as kinetic particles, and ambient plasma as a non-relativistic fluid. For a finite-temperature beam, a new class of negative energy magneto-sound waves is identified, which can possess negative energy. Their growth due to collisional dissipation in the cold return current destabilizes the beam-plasma system even for high beam temperatures. We perform detailed two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the thermal beam and collisional plasma. It is shown that in three dimensions, the Weibel instability persists even for physically collisionless background plasma. The anomalous plasma resistivity is then caused by the two-stream instability. 
0808.04079	From Altruism to Non-Cooperation in Routing Games	Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)	Authors:Amar Prakash Azad, Eitan Altman, R. El-Azouzi	Abstract:  The paper studies the routing in the network shared by several users. Each user seeks to optimize either its own performance or some combination between its own performance and that of other users, by controlling the routing of its given flow demand. We parameterize the degree of cooperation which allows to cover the fully non-cooperative behavior, the fully cooperative behavior, and even more, the fully altruistic behavior, all these as special cases of the parameter's choice. A large part of the work consists in exploring the impact of the degree of cooperation on the equilibrium. Our first finding is to identify multiple Nash equilibria with cooperative behavior that do not occur in the non-cooperative case under the same conditions (cost, demand and topology). We then identify Braess like paradox (in which adding capacity or adding a link to a network results in worse performance to all users) and study the impact of the degree of cooperation on it. We identify another type of paradox in cooperation scenario. We identify that when we increase the degree of cooperation of a user while other users keep unchanged their degree of cooperation, leads to an improvement in performance of that user. We then pursue the exploration and carry it on to the setting of Mixed equilibrium (i.e. some users are non atomic-they have infinitesimally small demand, and other have finite fixed demand). We finally obtain some theoretical results that show that for low degree of cooperation the equilibrium is unique, confirming the results of our numerical study. 
0808.04080	On the ergoregion instability in rotating gravastars	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:Cecilia B. M. H. Chirenti, Luciano Rezzolla	Abstract:  The ergoregion instability is known to affect very compact objects that rotate very rapidly and do not possess a horizon. We present here a detailed analysis on the relevance of the ergoregion instability for the viability of gravastars. Expanding on some recent results, we show that not all rotating gravastars are unstable. Rather, stable models can be constructed also with J/M^2 ~ 1, where J and M are the angular momentum and mass of the gravastar, respectively. The genesis of gravastars is still highly speculative and fundamentally unclear if not dubious. Yet, their existence cannot be ruled out by invoking the ergoregion instability. For the same reason, not all ultra-compact astrophysical objects rotating with J/M^2 <~ 1 are to be considered necessarily black holes. 
0808.04081	Numerical modelling of the effect of weathering on the progressive failure of underground limestone mines	Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)	Authors:Siavash Ghabezloo (ENPC-Cermes), Ahmad Pouya (LCPC)    	Abstract:  The observations show that the collapse of underground limestone mines results from a progressive failure due to gradual weathering of the rockmass. The following stages can be considered for the limestone weathering and degradation process in underground mines: condensation of the water on the roof of the gallery, infiltration of water in the porous rock, migration of the air CO2 molecules in the rock pore water by convection and molecular diffusion, dissolution of limestone by CO2 rich water and consequently, reduction of the strength properties of rock. Considering this process, a set of equations governing different hydrochemo-mechanical aspects of the weathering phenomenon and progressive failure occurring in these mines is presented. Then the feasibility of numerical modelling of this process is studied and a simple example of application is presented. 
0808.04082	Split Orders and Convex Polytopes in Buildings	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Thomas R. Shemanske	Abstract:  As part of his work to develop an explicit trace formula for Hecke operators on congruence subgroups of $SL_2(\Z)$, Hijikata defines and characterizes the notion of a split order in $M_2(k)$, where $k$ is a local field. In this paper, we generalize the notion of a split order to $M_n(k)$ for $n>2$ and give a natural geometric characterization in terms of the affine building for $SL_n(k)$. In particular, we show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between split orders in $M_n(k)$ and a collection of convex polytopes in apartments of the building such that the split order is the intersection of all the maximal orders representing the vertices in the polytope. This generalizes the geometric interpretation in the $n=2$ case in which split orders correspond to geodesics in the tree for $SL_2(k)$ with the split order given as the intersection of the endpoints of the geodesic. 
0808.04083	Poromechanical behaviour of hardened cement paste under isotropic loading	Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)	Authors:Siavash Ghabezloo (ENPC-CERMES), Jean Sulem (ENPC-CERMES), Sylvine Guédon (LCPC), Francçois Martineau (LCPC), Jérémie Saint-Marc (CSTJF)    	Abstract:  The poromechanical behaviour of hardened cement paste under isotropic loading is studied on the basis of an experimental testing program of drained, undrained and unjacketed compression tests. The macroscopic behaviour of the material is described in the framework of the mechanics of porous media. The poroelastic parameters of the material are determined and the effect of stress and pore pressure on them is evaluated. Appropriate effective stress laws which control the evolution of total volume, pore volume, solid volume, porosity and drained bulk modulus are discussed. A phenomenon of degradation of elastic properties is observed in the test results. The microscopic observations showed that this degradation is caused by the microcracking of the material under isotropic loading. The good compatibility and the consistency of the obtained poromechanical parameters demonstrate that the behaviour of the hardened cement paste can be indeed described within the framework of the theory of porous media. 
0808.04084	Effective stress law for the permeability of a limestone	Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)	Authors:Siavash Ghabezloo (ENPC-CERMES), Jean Sulem (ENPC-CERMES), Sylvine Guédon (LCPC), François Martineau (LCPC)    	Abstract:  The effective stress law for the permeability of a limestone is studied experimentally by performing constant head permeability tests in a triaxial cell with different conditions of confining pressure and pore pressure. Test results have shown that a pore pressure increase and a confining pressure decrease both result in an increase of the permeability, and that the effect of the pore pressure change on the variation of the permeability is more important than the effect of a change of the confining pressure. A power law is proposed for the variation of the permeability with the effective stress. The permeability effective stress coefficient increases linearly with the differential pressure and is greater than one as soon the differential pressure exceeds few bars. The test results are well reproduced using the proposed permeability-effective stress law. A conceptual pore-shell model based on a detailed observation of the microstructure of the studied limestone is proposed. This model is able to explain the experimental observations on the effect of the total stress and of the pore pressure on the permeability of the limestone. Effective stress coefficients for the stress-dependent permeability which are greater than one are obtained. It is shown that the controlling factor is the ratio of the different bulk moduli of the various constituents of the rock. This ratio is studied experimentally by performing microhardness tests. 
0808.04085	Signature of Primordial Non-Gaussianity on Matter Power Spectrum	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Atsushi Taruya, Kazuya Koyama, Takahiko Matsubara	Abstract:  Employing the perturbative treatment of gravitational clustering, we discuss possible effects of primordial non-Gaussianity on the matter power spectrum. As gravitational clustering develops, the coupling between different Fourier modes of density perturbations becomes important and the primordial non-Gaussianity which intrinsically possesses a non-trivial mode-correlation can affect the late-time evolution of the power spectrum. We quantitatively estimate the non-Gaussian effect on power spectrum from the perturbation theory. The potential impact on the cosmological parameter estimation using the power spectrum are investigated based on the Fisher-matrix formalism. In addition, on the basis of the local biasing prescription, non-Gaussian effects on the galaxy power spectrum are considered, showing that the scale-dependent biasing arises from a local-type primordial non-Gaussianity. On the other hand, an equilateral-type non-Gaussianity does not induce such scale-dependence because of weaker mode-correlations between small and large Fourier modes. 
0808.04086	A novel method for measuring the extragalactic background light: Fermi application to the lobes of Fornax A	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Markos Georganopoulos, Rita M. Sambruna, Demosthenes Kazanas, Analia N. Cillis, Chi C. Cheung, Eric S. Perlman, Katherine M. Blundell, David S. Davis	Abstract:  We describe a new method for measuring the extragalactic background light (EBL) through the detection of $γ$-ray inverse Compton (IC) emission due to scattering of the EBL photons off relativistic electrons in the lobes of radio galaxies. Our method has no free physical parameters and is a powerful tool when the lobes are characterized by a high energy sharp break or cutoff in their electron energy distribution (EED). We show that such a feature will produce a high energy IC `imprint' of the EBL spectrum in which the radio lobes are embedded, and show how this imprint can be used to derive the EBL. We apply our method to the bright nearby radio galaxy Fornax A, for which we demonstrate, using WMAP and EGRET observations, that the EED of its lobes is characterized by a conveniently located cutoff, bringing the IC EBL emission into the {\sl Fermi} energy range. We show that {\sl Fermi} will set upper limits to the optical EBL and measure the more elusive infrared EBL. 
0808.04087	Comments on claimed risk from metastable black holes	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Steven B. Giddings, Michelangelo L. Mangano	Abstract:  In a recent note, arXiv:0808.1415, it was argued that a hypothetical metastable black hole scenario could pose collider risk not excluded by our previous study. We comment on inconsistency of this proposed scenario. 
0808.04088	Affine model of stress stiffening in semiflexible filament networks	Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)	Authors:J.R. Blundell, E.M. Terentjev	Abstract:  We present a revised theoretical study of the affine assumption applied to semiflexible networks. Drawing on simple models of semiflexible worm-like chains we derive an expression for the probability distribution of crosslink separations valid at all separations. This accounts for both entropic and mechanical filament stretching. From this we obtain the free energy density of such networks explicitly as a function of applied strain. We are therefore able to calculate the elastic moduli of such networks for any imposed strain or stress. We find that accounting for the distribution of cross-link separations destroys the simple scaling of modulus with stress that is well known in single chains, and that such scaling is sensitive to the mechanical stretch modulus of individual filaments. We compare this model to three experimental data sets, for networks of different types of filaments, and find that a properly treated affine model can successfully account for the data. We find that for networks of stiffer filaments, such as F-actin, to fit data we require a much smaller effective persistence length than usually assumed to be characteristic of this filament type. We propose that such an effectively reduced rigidity of filaments might be a consequence of network formation. 
0808.04089	Maximum stellar mass versus cluster membership number revisited	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Th. Maschberger, C. J. Clarke	Abstract:  We have made a new compilation of observations of maximum stellar mass versus cluster membership number from the literature, which we analyse for consistency with the predictions of a simple random drawing hypothesis for stellar mass selection in clusters. Previously, Weidner and Kroupa have suggested that the maximum stellar mass is lower, in low mass clusters, than would be expected on the basis of random drawing, and have pointed out that this could have important implications for steepening the integrated initial mass function of the Galaxy (the IGIMF) at high masses. Our compilation demonstrates how the observed distribution in the plane of maximum stellar mass versus membership number is affected by the method of target selection; in particular, rather low n clusters with large maximum stellar masses are abundant in observational datasets that specifically seek clusters in the environs of high mass stars. Although we do not consider our compilation to be either complete or unbiased, we discuss the method by which such data should be statistically analysed. Our very provisional conclusion is that the data is not indicating any striking deviation from the expectations of random drawing. 
0808.04090	Reduced and projected two-particle entanglement at finite temperatures	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:P. Samuelsson, I. Neder, M. Buttiker	Abstract:  We present a theory for two-particle entanglement production and detection in mesoscopic conductors at finite temperature. In contrast to the zero temperature limit, the entanglement of the density matrix projected out of the emitted many-body state is different from the entanglement of the reduced density matrix, detectable by current correlation measurements. We show that under very general conditions the reduced entanglement constitutes a lower bound for the projected entanglement. Applying the theory to the recent experiment [Neder et al, Nature 448 333 (2007)] on a fermionic Hanbury Brown Twiss two-particle interferometer we find that despite an appreciable entanglement production in the experiment, the detectable entanglement is close to zero. 
0808.04091	PEL Modulispaces without $\mathbb C$-valued points	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Oliver Bueltel	Abstract:  We give several new moduli interpretations of the fibers of certain Shimura varieties over several prime numbers. As a corollary we obtain that for every prescribed odd prime characteristic $p$ every bounded symmetric domain possesses quotients by arithmetic groups whose models have good reduction at a prime divisor of $p$. 
0808.04092	Loss and Recovery of Gibbsianness for XY models in external fields	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:A.C.D. van Enter, W.M. Ruszel	Abstract:  We consider planar rotors (XY spins) in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, starting from an initial Gibbs measure and evolving with infinite-temperature stochastic (diffusive) dynamics. At intermediate times, if the system starts at low temperature, Gibbsianness can be lost. Due to the influence of the external initial field, Gibbsianness can be recovered after large finite times. We prove some results supporting this picture. 
0808.04093	What will be the maximum Tc in the iron-based superconductors?	Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el)	Authors:Xiuqing Huang	Abstract:  Using the newly developed real space vortex-lattice based theory of superconductivity, we study the maximum superconducting transition temperature (T_{c}^{\max}) in the iron-based superconductors. We find that all the reported FeAs superconductors can be divided into two basic classes (c/a=3 and c/a=5/2) depending on the lattice constants, where a is the Fe-Fe distance in the xy-plane and c is the Fe-Fe layer distance along the z-axis. Our results suggest that the former class has a maximum T_{c}^{\max}<60K, while the latter class has a lower T_{c}^{\max}\leq 40K. Our investigations further indicate that, in order to enhance T_{c}^{\max} in this family of compounds, new class of superconductors with a larger ratio of c/a should be synthesized. It is likely that their T_{c}^{\max} values could be raised into the liquid nitrogen range (77K) and 100K, supposing the new analogues with c/a=5 (approximately c>13A, if a=2.750A) and c/a=11 (c>31A) can be experimentally achieved, respectively. For the new FeSe series, our mechanism predicts that their T_{c}^{\max} is impossible to exceed 30 K due to a relatively shorter c-axis lattice constant (c/a=2). Finally, based on the new experimental results (arXiv:0811.0094 and arXiv:0811.2205), the possible ways to raise the Tc of the iron-based superconductors into 70 K are also suggested. 
0808.04094	Entanglement Entropy and Twist Fields	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Michele Caraglio, Ferdinando Gliozzi	Abstract:  The entanglement entropy of a subsystem of a quantum system is expressed, in the replica approach, through analytic continuation with respect to n of the trace of the n-th power of the reduced density matrix. This trace can be thought of as the vacuum expectation value of a suitable observable in a system made with n independent copies of the original system. We use this property to numerically evaluate it in some two-dimensional critical systems, where it can be compared with the results of Calabrese and Cardy, who wrote the same quantity in terms of correlation functions of twist fields of a conformal field theory. Although the two calculations match perfectly even in finite systems when the analyzed subsystem consists of a single interval, they disagree whenever the subsystem is composed of more than one connected part. The reasons of this disagreement are explained. 
0808.04095	Origin of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters and their helium enrichment	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Alvio Renzini	Abstract:  The various scenarios proposed for the origin of the multiple, helium-enriched populations in massive globular clusters are critically compared to the relevant constraining observations. Among accretion of helium-rich material by pre-existing stars, star formation out of ejecta from massive AGB stars or from fast rotating massive stars, and pollution by Population III stars, only the AGB option appears to be viable. Accretion or star formation out of outflowing disks would result in a spread of helium abundances, thus failing to produce the distinct, chemically homogeneous sub-populations such as those in the clusters $ω$ Cen and NGC 2808. Pollution by Population III stars would fail to produce sub-populations selectively enriched in helium, but maintaining the same abundance of heavy elements. Still, it is argued that for the AGB option to work two conditions should be satisfied: i) AGB stars experiencing the hot bottom burning process (i.e., those more massive than $\sim 3 \msun$) should rapidly eject their envelope upon arrival on the AGB, thus experiencing just a few third dredge-up episodes, and ii) clusters with multiple, helium enriched populations should be the remnants of much more massive systems, such as nucleated dwarf galaxies, as indeed widely assumed. 
0808.04096	Recent high-pt results from STAR	Nuclear Experiment (nucl-ex)	Authors:M. van Leeuwen (for the STAR collaboration)    	Abstract:  We present selected recent results of multi-hadron correlation measurements in azimuth and pseudorapidity at intermediate and high \pt{} in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, from the STAR experiment at RHIC. At intermediate \pt, measurements are presented that attempt to determine the origin of the associated near-side (small \dphi) yield at large pseudo-rapidity difference \deta{} that is found to be present in heavy ion collisions. In addition, results are reported on new multi-hadron correlation measures at high-\pt{} that use di-hadron triggers and multi-hadron cluster triggers with the goal to constrain the underlying jet kinematics better than in the existing measurements of inclusive spectra and di-hadron correlations. 
0808.04097	Emission line activity in type 2 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Montse Villar-Martin, Andrew Humphrey, Alejo Martinez-Sansigre, Miguel Perez-Torres, Luc Binette, Xue-Guang Zhang	Abstract:  We have compared the optical emission line ratios of type 2 quasars from Zakamska et al. with standard AGN photoionization model predictions, Seyfert 2s, HII galaxies, and narrow line FRII radio galaxies. Moderate to high ionization narrow line radio galaxies and Seyfert 2s are indistinguishable from type 2 quasars based on their optical line ratios. The standard AGN photoionization models, widely discussed for other type 2 AGNs, can reproduce successfully the loci and trends of type 2 quasars in some of the main diagnostic diagrams. These models are not exempt of problems and the discrepancies with the data are the same encountered for other type 2 AGNs. As for these, realistic models must take into account a range of cloud properties, as widely demonstrated in the literature. We also study the possible impact of stellar photoionization. 
0808.04098	State reduction dynamics in a simplified QED model	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:D. J. Bedingham	Abstract:  A simplified model of quantum electrodynamics involving a charged two-state system interacting with an electromagnetic field mode is examined. By extending the Schrodinger equation to include stochastic and nonlinear terms the dynamical process of quantum state reduction can be represented. A specific choice of modified Schrodinger dynamics is shown to result in stable coherent field states. The two-state system undergoes an induced state reduction to a generalised current state due to its interaction with the field mode. Numerical results are presented demonstrating state reduction dynamics for an initial superposition of two current states. An induced reduction time-scale for the two-state system is derived and confirmed by the numerics. 
0808.04099	The Influence of Concentration and Dynamical State on Scatter in the Galaxy Cluster Mass-Temperature Relation	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:H.-Y. Yang (1), P. M. Ricker (1,2), P. M. Sutter (1) ((1) University of Illinois, (2) NCSA)    	Abstract:  Using a hydrodynamics plus N-body simulation of galaxy cluster formation within a large volume and mock Chandra X-ray observations, we study the form and evolution of the intrinsic scatter about the best-fit X-ray temperature-mass relation for clusters. We investigate the physical origin of the scatter by correlating it with quantities that are closely related to clusters' formation and merging histories. We also examine the distribution of the scatter for merging and nonmerging populations, identified using halo merger trees derived from the simulation as well as X-ray substructure measures. We find a strong correlation between the scatter in the M-T_X relation and the halo concentration, in the sense that more concentrated clusters tend to be cooler than clusters with similar masses. No bias is found between the merging and relaxed clusters, but merging clusters generally have greater scatter, which is related to the properties of the distribution of halo concentrations. We also detect a signature of non-lognormality in the distribution of scatter for our simulated clusters both at z=0 and at z=1. A detailed comparison of merging clusters identified by substructure measures and by halo merger trees is given in the discussion. We conclude that, when cooling-related effects are neglected, the variation in halo concentrations is a more important factor for driving the intrinsic scatter in the M-T_X relation, while departures from hydrostatic equilibrium due to cluster mergers have a minor effect.

The same techniques are applied to give noncommutative extensions of probabilistic properties of codes. 
0808.04101	Are ring galaxies the ancestors of giant low surface brightness galaxies?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Mapelli (1), B. Moore (1), E. Ripamonti (2), L. Giordano (1), L. Mayer (1,3), M. Colpi (4), S. Callegari (1) ((1)University of Zurich, (2) Universit\`a dell'Insubria, (3) ETH Zurich, (4) Universit\`a di Milano Bicocca)    	Abstract:  Giant low surface brightness galaxies (GLSBs) have flat discs extending up to ~100 kpc. Their formation is a puzzle for cosmological simulations in the cold dark matter scenario. We suggest that GLSBs might be the final product of the evolution of collisional ring galaxies. In fact, our simulations show that, approximately 0.5-1.5 Gyr after the collision which led to the formation of the ring galaxy, the ring keeps expanding and fades, while the disc becomes very large (~100 kpc) and flat. At this stage, our simulated galaxies match many properties of GLSBs (surface brightness profile, morphology, HI spectrum and rotation curve). 
0808.04102	The ATLAS trigger menu for early data-taking	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:T. Kono, for the ATLAS Collaboration	Abstract:  The ATLAS trigger system is based on three levels of event selection that select the physics of interest from an initial bunch-crossing rate of 40 MHz. During nominal LHC operations at a luminosity of 10^34 cm^-2 s^-1, decisions must be taken every 25 ns with each bunch crossing containing about 23 interactions. The selections in the three trigger levels must provide sufficient rejection to reduce the rate down to 200 Hz, compatible with the offline computing power and storage capacity. The LHC is expected to begin operations in summer 2008 with a peak luminosity of 10^31 cm^-2 s^-1 with far fewer bunches than nominal running, but quickly ramp up to higher luminosities. Hence, we need to deploy trigger selections that can adapt to the changing beam conditions preserving the interesting physics and detector requirements that may vary with these conditions. We present the status of the preparation of the trigger menu for the early data-taking showing how we plan to deploy the trigger system from the first collision to the nominal luminosity. We also show expected rates and physics performance obtained from simulated data. 
0808.04103	Spin-wave mediated quantum corrections to the conductivity in thin ferromagnetic gadolinium films	Disordered Systems and Neural Networks (cond-mat.dis-nn)	Authors:R. Misra, A.F. Hebard, K.A. Muttalib, P. Wolfle	Abstract:  We present a study of quantum corrections to the conductivity of thin ferromagnetic gadolinium films. In situ magneto-transport measurements were performed on a series of thin films with thickness d < 135A. For sheet resistances R0 < 4011 Ohm and temperatures T < 30K, we observe a linear temperature dependence of the conductivity in addition to the logarithmic temperature dependence expected from well known quantum corrections in two dimensions. We show that such a linear T-dependence can arise from a spin-wave mediated Altshuler-Aronov type correction. 
0808.04104	Flow-level Characteristics of Spam and Ham	Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)	Authors:Dominik Schatzmann, Martin Burkhart, Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos	Abstract:  Despite a large amount of effort devoted in the past years trying to limit unsolicited mail, spam is still a major global concern. Content-analysis techniques and blacklists, the most popular methods used to identify and block spam, are beginning to lose their edge in the battle. We argue here that one not only needs to look into the network-related characteristics of spam traffic, as has been recently suggested, but also to look deeper into the network core, in order to counter the increasing sophistication of spam-ing methods. Yet, at the same time, local knowledge available at a given server can often be irreplaceable in identifying specific spammers. To this end, in this paper we show how the local intelligence of mail servers can be gathered and correlated pas- sively at the ISP-level providing valuable network-wide information. Specifically, we use first a large network flow trace from a medium size, national ISP, to demonstrate that the pre-filtering decisions of individual mail servers can be tracked and combined at the flow level. Then, we argue that such aggregated knowledge not only can allow ISPs to develop and evaluate powerful new methods for fighting spam, but also to monitor remotely what their own servers are doing. 
0808.04105	Reference grids of stellar models and oscillation frequencies: Data from the CESAM stellar evolution code and ADIPLS oscillation programme	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Yveline Lebreton, Eric Michel	Abstract:  We present grids of stellar models and their associated oscillation frequencies that have been used by the CoRoT Seismology Working Group during the scientific preparation of the CoRoT mission. The stellar models have been calculated with the CESAM stellar internal structure and evolution code while the oscillation frequencies have been obtained from the CESAM models by means of the ADIPLS adiabatic oscillation programme. The grids cover a range of masses, chemical compositions and evolutionary stages corresponding to those of the CoRoT primary targets. The stellar models and oscillation frequencies are available on line through the Evolution and Seismic Tools Activity (ESTA) web site. 
0808.04106	Interacting Field Theories in de Sitter Space are Non-Unitary	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Emil T. Akhmedov, P. V. Buividovich	Abstract:  It is well known that there should be a total cancellation of the IR divergences in unitary interacting field theories, such as QED and gravity. The cancellation should be at all orders between loop and tree level contributions to cross--sections. This is the crucial fact related to the unitarity of the evolution operator (S--matrix) of the underlying interacting field theory. In this note we show that such a cancellation does {\it not} happen in de Sitter space. 
0808.04107	Telescope interferometers: an alternative to classical wavefront sensors	Optics (physics.optics)	Authors:Francois Henault	Abstract:  Several types of Wavefront Sensors (WFS) are nowadays available in the field of Adaptive Optics (AO). Generally speaking, their basic principle consists in measuring slopes or curvatures of Wavefront Errors (WFE) transmitted by a telescope, subsequently reconstructing WFEs digitally. Such process, however, does not seem to be well suited for evaluating co-phasing or piston errors of future large segmented telescopes in quasi real-time. This communication presents an original, recently proposed technique for direct WFE sensing. The principle of the device, which is named "Telescope-Interferometer" (TI), is based on the addition of a reference optical arm into the telescope pupil plane. Then incident WFEs are deduced from Point Spread Function (PSF) measurements at the telescope focal plane. Herein are described two different types of TIs, and their performance are discussed in terms of intrinsic measurement accuracy and spatial resolution. Various error sources are studied by means of numerical simulations, among which photon noise sounds the most critical. Those computations finally help to define the application range of the TI method in an AO regime, including main and auxiliary telescope diameters and magnitude of the guide star. Some practical examples of optical configurations are also described and commented. 
0808.04108	A Thomason Model Structure on the Category of Small n-fold Categories	Algebraic Topology (math.AT)	Authors:Thomas M. Fiore, Simona Paoli	Abstract:  We construct a cofibrantly generated Quillen model structure on the category of small n-fold categories and prove that it is Quillen equivalent to the standard model structure on the category of simplicial sets. An n-fold functor is a weak equivalence if and only if the diagonal of its n-fold nerve is a weak equivalence of simplicial sets. This is an n-fold analogue to Thomason's Quillen model structure on Cat. We introduce an n-fold Grothendieck construction for multisimplicial sets, and prove that it is a homotopy inverse to the n-fold nerve. As a consequence, we completely prove that the unit and counit of the adjunction between simplicial sets and n-fold categories are natural weak equivalences. 
0808.04109	A note on cyclic semiregular subgroups of some 2-transitive permutation groups	Group Theory (math.GR)	Authors:Massimo Giulietti, Gabor Korchmaros	Abstract:  We determine the semi-regular subgroups of the 2-transitive permutation groups PGL(2,n), PSL(2,n), PGU(3,n), PSU(3,n), Sz(n) and Ree(n) with n a suitable power of a prime number p. 
0808.04110	Quantum ergodicity on graphs	Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD)	Authors:S. Gnutzmann, J.P. Keating, F. Piotet	Abstract:  We investigate the equidistribution of the eigenfunctions on quantum graphs in the high-energy limit. Our main result is an estimate of the deviations from equidistribution for large well-connected graphs. We use an exact field-theoretic expression in terms of a variant of the supersymmetric nonlinear sigma-model. Our estimate is based on a saddle-point analysis of this expression and leads to a criterion for when equidistribution emerges asymptotically in the limit of large graphs. Our theory predicts a rate of convergence that is a significant refinement of previous estimates, long-assumed to be valid for quantum chaotic systems, agreeing with them in some situations but not all. We discuss specific examples for which the theory is tested numerically. 
0808.04111	Relative Entropy and Statistics	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:François Bavaud	Abstract:  Formalising the confrontation of opinions (models) to observations (data) is the task of Inferential Statistics. Information Theory provides us with a basic functional, the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence), an asymmetrical measure of dissimilarity between the empirical and the theoretical distributions. The formal properties of the relative entropy turn out to be able to capture every aspect of Inferential Statistics, as illustrated here, for simplicity, on dices (= i.i.d. process with finitely many outcomes): refutability (strict or probabilistic): the asymmetry data / models; small deviations: rejecting a single hypothesis; competition between hypotheses and model selection; maximum likelihood: model inference and its limits; maximum entropy: reconstructing partially observed data; EM-algorithm; flow data and gravity modelling; determining the order of a Markov chain. 
0808.04112	Manifest Ultraviolet Behavior for the Three-Loop Four-Point Amplitude of N=8 Supergravity	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Z. Bern, J. J. M. Carrasco, L. J. Dixon, H. Johansson, R. Roiban	Abstract:  Using the method of maximal cuts, we obtain a form of the three-loop four-point scattering amplitude of N=8 supergravity in which all ultraviolet cancellations are made manifest. The Feynman loop integrals that appear have a graphical representation with only cubic vertices, and numerator factors that are quadratic in the loop momenta, rather than quartic as in the previous form. This quadratic behavior reflects cancellations beyond those required for finiteness, and matches the quadratic behavior of the three-loop four-point scattering amplitude in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. By direct integration we confirm that no additional cancellations remain in the N=8 supergravity amplitude, thus demonstrating that the critical dimension in which the first ultraviolet divergence occurs at three loops is D_c=6. We also give the values of the three-loop divergences in D=7,9,11. In addition, we present the explicitly color-dressed three-loop four-point amplitude of N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. 
0808.04113	Complex Organic Materials in the HR 4796A Disk?	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Koehler, I. Mann, Aigen Li	Abstract:  The red spectral shape of the visible to near infrared reflectance spectrum of the sharply-edged ring-like disk around the young main sequence star HR 4796A was recently interpreted as the presence of tholin-like complex organic materials which are seen in the atmosphere and surface of Titan and the surfaces of icy bodies in the solar system. However, we show in this Letter that porous grains comprised of common cosmic dust species (amorphous silicate, amorphous carbon, and water ice) also closely reproduce the observed reflectance spectrum, suggesting that the presence of complex organic materials in the HR 4796 disk is still not definitive. 
0808.04114	Length Four Polynomial Automorphisms	Algebraic Geometry (math.AG)	Authors:Sooraj Kuttykrishnan	Abstract:  We study the structure of length four polynomial automorphisms of $R[X,Y]$ when $R$ is a UFD. The results from this study are used to prove that if $\text{SL}_m(R[X_1,X_2,..., X_n]) = \text{E}_m(R[X_1,X_2,..., X_n])$ for all $n, m \ge 0$ then all length four polynomial automorphisms of $R[X,Y]$ that are conjugates are stably tame. 
0808.04115	On Dust Extinction of Gamma-ray Burst Host Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Aigen Li, S.L. Liang, D.A. Kann, D.M. Wei, S. Klose, Y.J. Wang	Abstract:  Although it is well recognized that gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows are obscured and reddened by dust in their host galaxies, the wavelength-dependence and quantity of dust extinction are still poorly known. Current studies on this mostly rely on fitting the afterglow spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with template extinction models. The inferred extinction (both quantity and wavelength-dependence) and dust-to-gas ratios are often in disagreement with that obtained from dust depletion and X-ray spectroscopy studies. We argue that this discrepancy could result from the prior assumption of a template extinction law. We propose an analytical formula to approximate the GRB host extinction law. With the template extinction laws self-contained, and the capability of revealing extinction laws differing from the conventional ones, it is shown that this is a powerful approach in modeling the afterglow SEDs to derive GRB host extinction. 
0808.04116	Evolution of a vacuum shell in the Friedman-Schwarzschild world	General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)	Authors:V. I. Dokuchaev, S. V. Chernov	Abstract:  The method of an effective potential is used to investigate the possible types of evolution of vacuum shells in the Friedman-Schwarzschild world. Such shells are assumed to emerge during phase transitions in the early Universe. The possible global geometries are constructed for the Friedman- Schwarzschild worlds. Approximate solutions to the equation of motion of a vacuum shell have been found. The conditions under which the end result of the evolution of the vacuum shells under consideration is the formation of black holes and wormholes with baby universes inside have been found. The interior of this world can be a closed, flat, or open Friedman universe. 
0808.04117	Dust in Active Galactic Nuclei	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Aigen Li	Abstract:  Dust plays an essential role in the unification theory of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). This review summarizes our current understanding of the extinction and infrared emission properties of the circumnuclear dust in AGNs as well as the inferred dust composition and size distribution. 
0808.04118	Asymptotic behavior of the smallest eigenvalue of matrices associated with completely even functions (mod r)	Number Theory (math.NT)	Authors:Shaofang Hong, Raphael Loewy	Abstract:  In this paper we present systematically analysis on the smallest eigenvalue of matrices associated with completely even functions (mod $r$). We obtain several theorems on the asymptotic behavior of the smallest eigenvalue of matrices associated with completely even functions (mod $r$). In particular, we get information on the asymptotic behavior of the smallest eigenvalue of the famous Smith matrices. Finally some examples are given to demonstrate the main results. 
0808.04119	Inverse Limits of Uniform Covering Maps	General Topology (math.GN)	Authors:Brendon LaBuz	Abstract:  In ``Rips complexes and covers in the uniform category'' the authors define, following James, covering maps of uniform spaces and introduce the concept of generalized uniform covering maps. Conditions for the existence of universal uniform covering maps and generalized uniform covering maps are given. This paper notes that the universal generalized uniform covering map is uniformly equivalent to the inverse limit of uniform covering maps and is therefore approximated by uniform covering maps. A characterization of generalized uniform covering maps that are approximated by uniform covering maps is provided as well as a characterization of generalized uniform covering maps that are uniformly equivalent to the inverse limit of uniform covering maps. Inverse limits of group actions that induce generalized uniform covering maps are also treated. 
0808.04120	Magnetocapacitance of a graphene monolayer	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:M. Tahir, K. Sabeeh, A. MacKinnon	Abstract:  We present a theoretical study of magnetocapacitance in a graphene monolayer at finite temperature taking into account the effects of disorder. The density of states (DOS) and magnetocapacitance found for graphene are compared to those found in standard two dimensional electron gas (2DEG) systems. The magnetic oscillations in DOS and magnetocapacitance are found to be enhanced and much more robust with respect to temperature damping in monolayer graphene in comparison with a 2DEG. Furthermore, we find that there is a $π$ phase shift between magnetic oscillations in the two systems which can be attributed to Dirac electrons in graphene acquiring a Berry's phase as they traverse a closed path in a magnetic field. 
0808.04121	On the Anomalous Silicate Emission Features of AGNs: A Possible Interpretation Based on Porous Dust	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M.P. Li, Q.J. Shi, Aigen Li	Abstract:  The recent Spitzer detections of the 9.7 micron Si--O silicate emission in type 1 AGNs provide support for the AGN unification scheme. The properties of the silicate dust are of key importance to understanding the physical, chemical and evolutionary properties of the obscuring dusty torus around AGNs. Compared to that of the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM), the 10 micron silicate emission profile of type 1 AGNs is broadened and has a clear shift of peak position to longer wavelengths. In literature this is generally interpreted as an indication of the deviations of the silicate composition, size, and degree of crystallization of AGNs from that of the Galactic ISM. In this Letter we show that the observed peak shift and profile broadening of the 9.7 micron silicate emission feature can be explained in terms of porous composite dust consisting of ordinary interstellar amorphous silicate, amorphous carbon and vacuum. Porous dust is naturally expected in the dense circumnuclear region around AGNs, as a consequence of grain coagulation. 
0808.04122	Swapping Lemmas for Regular and Context-Free Languages	Computational Complexity (cs.CC)	Authors:Tomoyuki Yamakami	Abstract:  In formal language theory, one of the most fundamental tools, known as pumping lemmas, is extremely useful for regular and context-free languages. However, there are natural properties for which the pumping lemmas are of little use. One of such examples concerns a notion of advice, which depends only on the size of an underlying input. A standard pumping lemma encounters difficulty in proving that a given language is not regular in the presence of advice. We develop its substitution, called a swapping lemma for regular languages, to demonstrate the non-regularity of a target language with advice. For context-free languages, we also present a similar form of swapping lemma, which serves as a technical tool to show that certain languages are not context-free with advice. 
0808.04123	Optical Properties of Dust	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Aigen Li	Abstract:  Except in a few cases cosmic dust can be studied in situ or in terrestrial laboratories, essentially all of our information concerning the nature of cosmic dust depends upon its interaction with electromagnetic radiation. This chapter presents the theoretical basis for describing the optical properties of dust -- how it absorbs and scatters starlight and reradiates the absorbed energy at longer wavelengths.

This study focuses on double helicity asymmetries in eta and charged pion production at mid-rapidity, as well as on the eta cross section and fragmentation functions. 
0808.04125	Poisson quasi-Nijenhuis structures with background	Differential Geometry (math.DG)	Authors:Paulo Antunes	Abstract:  We define the Poisson quasi-Nijenhuis structures with background on Lie algebroids and we prove that to any generalized complex structure on a Courant algebroid which is the double of a Lie algebroid is associated such a structure. We prove that any Lie algebroid with a Poisson quasi-Nijenhuis structure with background constitutes, with its dual, a quasi-Lie bialgebroid. We also prove that any pair $(π,ω)$ of a Poisson bivector and a 2-form induces a Poisson quasi-Nijenhuis structure with background and we observe that particular cases correspond to already known compatibilities between $π$ and $ω$. 
0808.04126	On Buckyonions as an Interstellar Grain Component	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Aigen Li, J.H. Chen, M.P. Li, Q.J. Shi, Y.J. Wang	Abstract:  The carrier of the 2175 Angstrom interstellar extinction feature remains unidentified since its first detection over 40 years ago. In recent years carbon buckyonions have been proposed as a carrier of this feature, based on the close similarity between the electronic transition spectra of buckyonions and the 2175 Angstrom interstellar feature. We examine this hypothesis by modeling the interstellar extinction with buckyonions as a dust component. It is found that dust models containing buckyonions (in addition to amorphous silicates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules, graphite) can closely reproduce the observed interstellar extinction curve. To further test this hypothesis, we call for experimental measurements and/or theoretical calculations of the infrared vibrational spectra of hydrogenated buckyonions. By comparing the infrared emission spectra predicted for buckyonions vibrationally excited by the interstellar radiation with the observed emission spectra of the diffuse interstellar medium, we will be able to derive (or place an upper limit on) the abundance of interstellar buckyonions. 
0808.04127	Spectral action and neutrino mass	Mathematical Physics (math-ph)	Authors:Andrzej Sitarz	Abstract:  We propose the extension of the spectral action principle to fermions and show that the neutrino mass terms appear then naturally as next-order corrections. 
0808.04128	Predictions for Supersymmetric Particle Masses in the CMSSM using Indirect Experimental and Cosmological Constraints	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:O. Buchmueller, R. Cavanaugh, A. De Roeck, J.R. Ellis, H. Flaecher, S. Heinemeyer, G. Isidori, K.A. Olive, P. Paradisi, F.J. Ronga, G. Weiglein	Abstract:  In view of the imminent start of the LHC experimental programme, we use the available indirect experimental and cosmological information to estimate the likely range of parameters of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (CMSSM), using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to sample the parameter space. The 95% confidence-level area in the (m_0, m_1/2) plane of the CMSSM lies largely within the region that could be explored with 1/fb of integrated luminosity at 14 TeV, and much of the 68% confidence-level area lies within the region that could be explored with 50/pb of integrated luminosity at 10 TeV. A same-sign dilepton signal could well be visible in most of the 68% confidence-level area with 1/fb of integrated luminosity at 14 TeV. We discuss the sensitivities of the preferred ranges to variations in the most relevant indirect experimental and cosmological constraints and also to deviations from the universality of the supersymmetry-breaking contributions to the masses of the Higgs bosons. 
0808.04129	On the Crystallinity of Silicate Dust in the Interstellar Medium	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M.P. Li, G. Zhao, Aigen Li	Abstract:  An accurate knowledge of the mineralogy (chemical composition and crystal structure) of the silicate dust in the interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial for understanding its origin in evolved stars, the physical and chemical processing in the ISM, and its subsequent incorporation into protostellar nebulae, protoplanetary disks and cometary nuclei where it is subjected to further processing. While an appreciable fraction of silicate dust in evolved stars, in protoplanetary disks around pre-main sequence stars, in debris disks around main sequence stars, and in cometary nuclei is found to be in crystalline form, very recent infrared spectroscopic studies of the dust along the sightline toward the Galactic center source Sgr A* placed an upper limit of ~1.1% on the silicate crystalline fraction, well below the previous estimates of ~5% or ~60% derived from the observed 10 micron absorption profile for the local ISM toward Cyg OB2 No.12. Since the sightline toward SgrA contains molecular cloud materials as revealed by the detection of the 3.1 and 6.0 micron water ice absorption features, we argue that by taking into account the presence of ice mantles on silicate cores, the upper limit on the degree of silicate crystallinity in the ISM is increased to ~3--5%. 
0808.04130	Tentative Detection of the Rotation of Eris	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:H.G. Roe, R.E. Pike, M.E. Brown	Abstract:  We report a multi-week sequence of B-band photometric measurements of the dwarf planet Eris using the {\it Swift} satellite. The use of an observatory in low-Earth orbit provides better temporal sampling than is available with a ground-based telescope. We find no compelling evidence for an unusually slow rotation period of multiple days, as has been suggested previously. A $\sim$1.08 day rotation period is marginally detected at a modest level of statistical confidence ($\sim$97%). Analysis of the combination of the $Swift$ data with the ground-based B-band measurements of \citet{2007AJ....133...26R} returns the same period ($\sim$1.08 day) at a slightly higher statistical confidence ($\sim$99%). 
0808.04131	Acoustooptic Bragg Diffraction in 2-Dimensional Photonic Crystals	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:Z.A. Pyatakova	Abstract:  The paper shows that silicon-based 2D photonic crystal can be a promising material for acoustooptical devices. Isotropic and anisotropic Bragg diffraction of light in photonic crystal is considered. The computational method for calculation of frequency dependences of Bragg angle is developed. A simple method of optimization of photonic crystal parameters to obtain Bragg diffraction at necessary light and sound frequency is suggested. 
0808.04132	Prediction for the He I 10830A Absorption Wing in the Coming Event of Eta Carinae	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Amit Kashi, Noam Soker (Technion, Israel)    	Abstract:  We propose an explanation to the puzzling appearance of a wide blue absorption wing in the He I 10830A P-Cygni profile of the massive binary star Eta Carinae several months before periastron passage. Our basic assumption is that the colliding winds region is responsible for the blue wing absorption. By fitting observations, we find that the maximum outflow velocity of this absorbing material is ~2300 km/s. We also assume that the secondary star is toward the observer at periastron passage. With a toy-model we achieve two significant results. (1) We show that the semimajor axis orientation we use can account for the appearance and evolution of the wide blue wing under our basic assumption. (2) We predict that the Doppler shift (the edge of the absorption profile) will reach a maximum 0-3 weeks before periastron passage, and not necessarily exactly at periastron passage or after periastron passage. 
0808.04133	Tableau-based decision procedure for the multi-agent epistemic logic with operators of common and distributed knowledge	Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO)	Authors:Valentin Goranko, Dmitry Shkatov	Abstract:  We develop an incremental-tableau-based decision procedure for the multi-agent epistemic logic MAEL(CD) (aka S5_n (CD)), whose language contains operators of individual knowledge for a finite set Ag of agents, as well as operators of distributed and common knowledge among all agents in Ag. Our tableau procedure works in (deterministic) exponential time, thus establishing an upper bound for MAEL(CD)-satisfiability that matches the (implicit) lower-bound known from earlier results, which implies ExpTime-completeness of MAEL(CD)-satisfiability. Therefore, our procedure provides a complexity-optimal algorithm for checking MAEL(CD)-satisfiability, which, however, in most cases is much more efficient. We prove soundness and completeness of the procedure, and illustrate it with an example. 
0808.04134	Spectral Sparsification of Graphs	Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS)	Authors:Daniel A. Spielman, Shang-Hua Teng	Abstract:  We introduce a new notion of graph sparsificaiton based on spectral similarity of graph Laplacians: spectral sparsification requires that the Laplacian quadratic form of the sparsifier approximate that of the original. This is equivalent to saying that the Laplacian of the sparsifier is a good preconditioner for the Laplacian of the original. We prove that every graph has a spectral sparsifier of nearly linear size. Moreover, we present an algorithm that produces spectral sparsifiers in time $\softO{m}$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the original graph. This construction is a key component of a nearly-linear time algorithm for solving linear equations in diagonally-dominant matrcies. Our sparsification algorithm makes use of a nearly-linear time algorithm for graph partitioning that satisfies a strong guarantee: if the partition it outputs is very unbalanced, then the larger part is contained in a subgraph of high conductance. 
0808.04135	Achieving the Empirical Capacity Using Feedback Part I: Memoryless Additive Models	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Ofer Shayevitz, Meir Feder	Abstract:  We address the problem of universal communications over an unknown channel with an instantaneous noiseless feedback, and show how rates corresponding to the empirical behavior of the channel can be attained, although no rate can be guaranteed in advance. First, we consider a discrete modulo-additive channel with alphabet $\mathcal{X}$, where the noise sequence $Z^n$ is arbitrary and unknown and may causally depend on the transmitted and received sequences and on the encoder's message, possibly in an adversarial fashion. Although the classical capacity of this channel is zero, we show that rates approaching the empirical capacity $\log|\mathcal{X}|-H_{emp}(Z^n)$ can be universally attained, where $H_{emp}(Z^n)$ is the empirical entropy of $Z^n$. For the more general setting where the channel can map its input to an output in an arbitrary unknown fashion subject only to causality, we model the empirical channel actions as the modulo-addition of a realized noise sequence, and show that the same result applies if common randomness is available. The results are proved constructively, by providing a simple sequential transmission scheme approaching the empirical capacity. In part II of this work we demonstrate how even higher rates can be attained by using more elaborate models for channel actions, and by utilizing possible empirical dependencies in its behavior. 
0808.04136	Equation-of-State Dependent Features in Shock-Oscillation Modulated Neutrino and Gravitational-Wave Signals from Supernovae	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:A. Marek, H.-Th. Janka, E. Mueller	Abstract:  We present 2D hydrodynamic simulations of the long-time accretion phase of a 15 solar mass star after core bounce and before the launch of a supernova explosion. Our simulations are performed with the Prometheus-Vertex code, employing multi-flavor, energy-dependent neutrino transport and an effective relativistic gravitational potential. Testing the influence of a stiff and a soft equation of state for hot neutron star matter, we find that the non-radial mass motions in the supernova core due to the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) and convection impose a time variability on the neutrino and gravitational-wave signals. These variations have larger amplitudes as well as higher frequencies in the case of a more compact nascent neutron star. After the prompt shock-breakout burst of electron neutrinos, a more compact accreting remnant radiates neutrinos with higher luminosities and larger mean energies. The observable neutrino emission in the direction of SASI shock oscillations exhibits a modulation of several 10% in the luminosities and ~1 MeV in the mean energies with most power at typical SASI frequencies of 20-100 Hz. At times later than 50-100 ms after bounce the gravitational-wave amplitude is dominated by the growing low-frequency (<200 Hz) signal associated with anisotropic neutrino emission. A high-frequency wave signal is caused by nonradial gas flows in the outer neutron star layers, which are stirred by anisotropic accretion from the SASI and convective regions. The gravitational-wave power then peaks at about 300-800 Hz with distinctively higher spectral frequencies originating from the more compact and more rapidly contracting neutron star. The detectability of the SASI effects in the neutrino and gravitational-wave signals is briefly discussed. (abridged) 
0808.04137	Effect of Induced Spin-Orbit Coupling for Atoms via Laser Fields	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Xiong-Jun Liu, Mario F. Borunda, Xin Liu, Jairo Sinova	Abstract:  We propose an experimental scheme to study spin-orbit coupling effects in a of two-dimensional (2D) Fermi atomic gas cloud by coupling its internal electronic states (pseudospins) to radiation in a delta configuration. The induced spin-orbit coupling can be of the Dresselhaus and Rashba type with and without a Zeeman term. We show that the optically induced spin-orbit coupling can lead to a spin-dependent effective mass under appropriate condition, with one of them able to be tuned between positive and negative effective mass. As a direct observable we show that in the expansion dynamics of the atomic cloud the initial atomic cloud splits into two clouds for the positive effective mass case regime, and into four clouds for the negative effective mass regime.

Aidala, for the PHENIX, BRAHMS Collaborations	Abstract:  A variety of measurements performed utilizing transversely polarized proton- proton collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) are now avail- able. Recent results from the PHENIX and BRAHMS experiments are presented and discussed. 
0808.04140	Fidelity approach to the disordered quantum XY model	Quantum Physics (quant-ph)	Authors:Silvano Garnerone, N. Tobias Jacobson, Stephan Haas, Paolo Zanardi	Abstract:  We study the random XY spin chain in a transverse field by analyzing the susceptibility of the ground state fidelity, numerically evaluated through a standard mapping of the model onto quasi-free fermions. It is found that the fidelity susceptibility and its scaling properties provide useful information about the phase diagram. In particular it is possible to determine the Ising critical line and the Griffiths phase regions, in agreement with previous analytical and numerical results. 
0808.04141	General Relativistic Hydrodynamic Simulations and Linear Analysis of the Standing Accretion Shock Instability around a Black Hole	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Hiroki Nagakura, Shoichi Yamada	Abstract:  We study the stability of standing shock waves in advection-dominated accretion flows into a Schwarzschild black hole by 2D general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations as well as linear analysis in the equatorial plane. We demonstrate that the accretion shock is stable against axisymmetric perturbations but becomes unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations. The results of dynamical simulations show good agreement with linear analysis on the stability, oscillation and growing time scales. The comparison of different wave-travel times with the growth time scales of the instability suggests that the instability is likely to be of the Papaloizou-Pringle type, induced by the repeated propagations of acoustic waves. However, the wavelengths of perturbations are too long to clearly define the reflection point. By analyzing the non-linear phase in the dynamical simulations, it is shown that quadratic mode couplings precede the non-linear saturation. It is also found that not only short-term random fluctuations by turbulent motions but also quasi periodic oscillations take place on longer time scales in the non-linear phase. We give some possible implications of the instability for quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs) and the central engine for gamma ray bursts (GRBs). 
0808.04142	Observation of the doubly strange b baryon Omega_b-	High Energy Physics - Experiment (hep-ex)	Authors:D0 Collaboration: V. Abazov, et al    	Abstract:  We report the observation of the doubly strange b baryon Omega_b- in the decay channel Omega_b- to J/psi Omega-, with J/psi to mu+ mu- and Omega- to Lambda K-, in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV. Using approximately 1.3 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider, we observe 17.8 +/- 4.9 (stat) +/- 0.8 (syst) Omega_b- signal events at a mass of 6.165 +/- 0.010 (stat) +/- 0.013(syst.) GeV. The significance of the observed signal is 5.4 sigma, corresponding to a probability of 6.7 x 10^{-8} of it arising from a background fluctuation. 
0808.04143	Adiabaticity and localization in one-dimensional incommensurate lattices	Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)	Authors:E. E. Edwards, M. Beeler, Tao Hong, S. L. Rolston	Abstract:  We experimentally investigate the role of localization on the adiabaticity of loading a Bose-Einstein condensate into a one-dimensional optical potential comprised of a shallow primary lattice plus one or two perturbing lattice(s) of incommensurate period. We find that even a very weak perturbation causes dramatic changes in the momentum distribution and makes adiabatic loading of the combined lattice much more difficult than for a single period lattice. We interpret our results using a band structure model and the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation. 
0808.04144	Asymptotic and descent formulas for weighted orbital integrals	Representation Theory (math.RT)	Authors:Werner Hoffmann	Abstract:  We rewrite Arthur's asymptotic formula for weighted orbital integrals on real groups with the aid of a residue calculus and extend the resulting formula to the Schwartz space. Then we extract the available information about the coefficients in the decomposition of the Fourier transforms of Arthur's invariant distributions I_M(γ) in terms of standard solutions of the pertinent holonomic system of differential equations. This allows us to determine some of those coefficients explicitly. Finally, we prove descent formulas for those differential equations, for their standard solutions and for the aforementioned coefficients, which reduce each of them to the case that γis elliptic in M. 
0808.04145	Resistance Fluctuations in Composite Fermion State near Landau Level Filling Factor $ν= 1/2$ in A Square Quantum Well	Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics (cond-mat.mes-hall)	Authors:Jian Zhang, R. R. Du, J. A. Simmons, J. L. Reno	Abstract:  We have studied the magnetotransport near Landau level filling factor $ν= 1/2$ in a GaAs-Al0.3Ga0.7As square quantum well (width 35 nm) in magnetic field up to 42 T and in a temperature range between 50 mK and 1.5 K. In low temperatures T < 200 mK, the Rxx exhibits a deep, strongly temperature-dependent minimum centered at $ν= 1/2$. The concomitant Rxy is not strictly linear with magnetic field (B) and the first derivative of Rxy with respect to B shows a sharp cusp at $ν= 1/2$, indicating a non-classical Hall effect. We verify these characteristics are being single-layer origin by applying an in-plane magnetic field or electrostatic gates. The data may signal frustrations in the composite fermion state towards $ν= 1/2$ pairing in the quantum well where the electron layer thickness far exceeds the magnetic length. 
0808.04146	Dynamic Connectivity in ALOHA Ad Hoc Networks	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:RadhaKrishna Ganti, Martin Haenggi	Abstract:  In a wireless network the set of transmitting nodes changes frequently because of the MAC scheduler and the traffic load. Previously, connectivity in wireless networks was analyzed using static geometric graphs, and as we show leads to an overly constrained design criterion. The dynamic nature of the transmitting set introduces additional randomness in a wireless system that improves the connectivity, and this additional randomness is not captured by a static connectivity graph. In this paper, we consider an ad hoc network with half-duplex radios that uses multihop routing and slotted ALOHA for the MAC contention and introduce a random dynamic multi-digraph to model its connectivity. We first provide analytical results about the degree distribution of the graph. Next, defining the path formation time as the minimum time required for a causal path to form between the source and destination on the dynamic graph, we derive the distributional properties of the connection delay using techniques from first-passage percolation and epidemic processes. We consider the giant component of the network formed when communication is noise-limited (by neglecting interference). Then, in the presence of interference, we prove that the delay scales linearly with the source-destination distance on this giant component. We also provide simulation results to support the theoretical results. 
0808.04147	Heteronuclear quantum gas mixtures	Other Condensed Matter (cond-mat.other)	Authors:C. Ospelkaus, S. Ospelkaus	Abstract:  This PhD tutorial article is a review of our experiments on heteronuclear quantum gas mixtures at the University of Hamburg. We introduce basic properties of trapped Fermi-Bose mixtures and demonstrate the achievement of large quantum degenerate mixtures of 40K and 87Rb. Using heteronuclear Feshbach resonances, we show how the heteronuclear interaction can be tuned, allowing us to induce phase separation and collapse for large repulsive and attractive interactions, respectively. We realize Fermi-Bose mixtures in 3D optical lattices as a novel quantum many-body system and study coherence properties of the mixture. Combining our experiments on lattices and Feshbach resonances, we present the first realization of ultracold heteronuclear Feshbach molecules. The molecules are created at individual sites of a 3D optical lattice. We discuss lifetime, binding energy and rf association efficiency in terms of a universal model and give an outlook for possible future developments.

We prove that the concave end of X can be compactified, if and only if, the first cohomology of X is Hausdorff. 
0808.04149	Modeling of Body Mass Index by Newton's Second Law	Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)	Authors:E. Canessa	Abstract:  Since laws of physics exist in nature, their possible relationship to terrestial growth is introduced. By considering the human body as a dynamic system of variable mass (and volume), growing under a gravity field, it is shown how natural laws may influence the vertical growth of humans. This approach makes sense because the non-linear percentile curves of different aspects of human physical growth from childhood to adolescence can be described in relation to physics laws independently of gender and nationality. Analytical relations for the dependence of stature, measured mass (weight), growth velocity (and their mix as the body mass index) on age are deduced with a set of common statistical parameters which could relate environmental, genetics and metabolism and different aspects of physical growth on earth. A relationship to the monotone smoothing using functional data analysis to estimate growth curves and its derivatives is established. A preliminary discussion is also presented on horizontal growth in an essentially weightless environment (i.e., aquatic) with a connection to the Laird-Gompertz formula for growth. 
0808.04150	Spin-lozenge thermodynamics and magnetic excitations in Na$_3$RuO$_4$	Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)	Authors:J. T. Haraldsen, M. B. Stone, M. D. Lumsden, E. Mamontov, T. Barnes, R. Jin, J. W. Taylor, F. Fernandez-Alonso	Abstract:  We report inelastic and elastic neutron scattering, magnetic susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements of polycrystalline sodium ruthenate (Na$_3$RuO$_4$). Previous work suggests this material consists of isolated tetramers of $S=3/2$ Ru$^{5+}$ ions in a so-called "lozenge" configuration. Using a Heisenberg antiferromagnet Hamiltonian, we analytically determine the energy eigenstates for general spin $S$. From this model, the neutron scattering cross-sections for excitations associated with spin-3/2 spin-tetramer configurations is determined. Comparison of magnetic susceptibility and inelastic neutron scattering results shows that the proposed "lozenge" model is not distinctly supported, but provides evidence that the system may be better described as a pair of non-interacting inequivalent dimers, \textit{i.e} double dimers. However, the existence of long-range magnetic order below $T_c \approx 28$ K immediately questions such a description. Although no evidence of the lozenge model is observed, future studies on single crystals may further clarify the appropriate magnetic Hamiltonian. 
0808.04151	Testing the Dark Matter Interpretation of the DAMA/LIBRA Result with Super-Kamiokande	High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)	Authors:Jonathan L. Feng, Jason Kumar, John Learned, Louis E. Strigari	Abstract:  We consider the prospects for testing the dark matter interpretation of the DAMA/LIBRA signal with the Super-Kamiokande experiment. The DAMA/LIBRA signal favors dark matter with low mass and high scattering cross section. We show that these characteristics imply that the scattering cross section that enters the DAMA/LIBRA event rate determines the annihilation rate probed by Super-Kamiokande. Current limits from Super-Kamiokande through-going events do not test the DAMA/LIBRA favored region. We show, however, that upcoming analyses including fully-contained events with sensitivity to dark matter masses from 5 to 10 GeV may corroborate the DAMA/LIBRA signal. We conclude by considering three specific dark matter candidates, neutralinos, WIMPless dark matter, and mirror dark matter, which illustrate the various model-dependent assumptions entering our analysis. 
0808.04152	Latest supernovae constraints on f(R) cosmologies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:J. Santos, J.S. Alcaniz, F.C. Carvalho, N. Pires	Abstract:  A class of modified gravity, known as $f(R)$-gravity, has presently been applied to Cosmology as a realistic alternative to dark energy. In this paper we use the most recent Type-Ia Supernova (SNe Ia) data, the so-called \emph{Union} sample of 307 SNe Ia, to place bounds on a theory of the form $f(R)=R - β/R^n$ within the Palatini approach. Given the complementarity of SNe Ia data with other cosmological observables, a joint analysis with measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation peak and estimates of the {\rm CMB} shift parameter is also performed. We show that, for the allowed intervals of $n$, $Ω_{mo}$, and $β$, models based on $f(R) = R - β/R^{n}$ gravity in the Palatini approach can produce the sequence of radiation-dominated, matter-dominated, and accelerating periods without need of dark energy. 
0808.04153	PAHs in Comets: An Overview	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Aigen Li	Abstract:  Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules, ubiquitously seen in the interstellar medium (ISM) of our own and external galaxies, might have been incorporated into comets if they are formed from relatively unprocessed interstellar matter. The detection of PAHs in comets would be an important link between the ISM and comets. This review compiles our current knowledge on cometary PAHs, based on ground-based and space-borne observations of infrared vibrational and ultraviolet fluorescence spectra of comets, and laboratory analysis of interplanetary dust particles possibly of cometary origin and cometary samples returned to Earth by the Stardust spacecraft. The latter provided the most unambiguous evidence for the presence of PAHs in cometary nuclei. 
0808.04154	Constraining the AGN Contribution in a Multiwavelength Study of Seyfert Galaxies	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:M. Meléndez, S.B. Kraemer, H.R. Schmitt, D.M. Crenshaw, R.P. Deo, R.F. Mushotzky, F.C. Bruhweiler	Abstract:  We have studied the relationship between the high- and low-ionization [O IV] lambda 25.89 micron, [Ne III] lambda 15.56 micron and [Ne II] lambda 12.81 micron emission lines with the aim of constraining the active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation contributions for a sample of 103 Seyfert galaxies. We used the [O IV] and [Ne II] emission as tracers for the AGN power and star formation to investigate the ionization state of the emission-line gas. We find that Seyfert 2 galaxies have, on average, lower [O IV]/[Ne II] ratios than those of Seyfert 1 galaxies. This result suggests two possible scenarios: 1) Seyfert 2 galaxies have intrinsically weaker AGN, or 2) Seyfert 2 galaxies have relatively higher star formation rates than Seyfert 1 galaxies. We estimate the fraction of [Ne II] directly associated with the AGN and find that Seyfert 2 galaxies have a larger contribution from star formation, by a factor of ~1.5 on average, than what is found in Seyfert 1 galaxies. Using the stellar component of [Ne II] as a tracer of the current star formation we found similar star formation rates in Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies. We examined the mid- and far-infrared continua and find that [Ne II] is well correlated with the continuum luminosity at 60 micron and that both [Ne III] and [O IV] are better correlated with the 25 micron luminosities than with the continuum at longer wavelengths, suggesting that the mid-infrared continuum luminosity is dominated by the AGN, while the far-infrared luminosity is dominated by star formation. Overall, these results test the unified model of AGN, and suggest that the differences between Seyfert galaxies cannot be solely due to viewing angle dependence. 
0808.04155	Quiver Chern-Simons theories and crystals	High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)	Authors:Yosuke Imamura, Keisuke Kimura	Abstract:  We consider N=2 quiver Chern-Simons theories described by brane tilings, whose moduli spaces are toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds. Simple prescriptions to obtain toric data of the moduli space and a corresponding brane crystal from a brane tiling are proposed. 
0808.04156	Rate-Distortion via Markov Chain Monte Carlo	Information Theory (cs.IT)	Authors:Shirin Jalali, Tsachy Weissman	Abstract:  We propose an approach to lossy source coding, utilizing ideas from Gibbs sampling, simulated annealing, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The idea is to sample a reconstruction sequence from a Boltzmann distribution associated with an energy function that incorporates the distortion between the source and reconstruction, the compressibility of the reconstruction, and the point sought on the rate-distortion curve. To sample from this distribution, we use a `heat bath algorithm': Starting from an initial candidate reconstruction (say the original source sequence), at every iteration, an index i is chosen and the i-th sequence component is replaced by drawing from the conditional probability distribution for that component given all the rest. At the end of this process, the encoder conveys the reconstruction to the decoder using universal lossless compression. The complexity of each iteration is independent of the sequence length and only linearly dependent on a certain context parameter (which grows sub-logarithmically with the sequence length). We show that the proposed algorithms achieve optimum rate-distortion performance in the limits of large number of iterations, and sequence length, when employed on any stationary ergodic source. Experimentation shows promising initial results. Employing our lossy compressors on noisy data, with appropriately chosen distortion measure and level, followed by a simple de-randomization operation, results in a family of denoisers that compares favorably (both theoretically and in practice) with other MCMC-based schemes, and with the Discrete Universal Denoiser (DUDE). 
0808.04157	No Evidence for Variability of Intervening Absorption Lines toward GRB 060206: Implications for the Mg II Incidence Problem	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Kentaro Aoki, Tomonori Totani, Takashi Hattori, Kouji Ohta, Koji S. Kawabata, Naoto Kobayashi, Masanori Iye, Ken-ichi Nomoto, Nobuyuki Kawai	Abstract:  We examine variability of absorption line strength of intervening systems along the line of sight to GRB 060206 at $z = 4.05$, by the low-resolution optical spectra obtained by the Subaru telescope from six to ten hours after the burst. Strong variabilities of Fe\emissiontype{II} and Mg\emissiontype{II} lines at $z=1.48$ during $t=$5--8 hours have been reported for this GRB \citep{Hao07}, and this has been used to support the idea of clumpy Mg\emissiontype{II} cloudlets that was originally proposed to explain the anomalously high incidence of Mg\emissiontype{II} absorbers in GRB spectra compared with quasars . However, our spectra with higher signal-to-noise ratio do not show any evidence for variability in $t=$6-10 hours. There is a clear discrepancy between our data and Hao et al. data in the overlapping time interval. Furthermore, the line strengths in our data are in good agreement with those observed at $t \sim$ 2 hours by \citet{Tho08}. We also detected Fe\emissiontype{II} and Mg\emissiontype{II} absorption lines for a system at $z = 2.26$, and these lines do not show evidence for variability either. Therefore we conclude that there is no strong evidence for variability of intervening absorption lines toward GRB 060206, significantly weakening the support to the Mg\emissiontype{II} cloudlet hypothe sis by the GRB 060206 data. 
0808.04158	Stability criteria for q-expectation values	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Rudolf Hanel, Stefan Thurner	Abstract:  In statistical physics lately a specific kind of average, called the q-expectation value, has been extensively used in the context of q-generalized statistics dealing with distributions following power-laws. In this context q-expectation values appear naturally. After it has been recently shown that this non-linear functional is instable, under a very strong notion of stability, it is therefore of high interest to know sufficient conditions for when the results of q-expectations are robust under small variations of the underlying distribution function. We show that reasonable restrictions on the domain of admissible probability distributions restore uniform continuity for the q-expectation. Bounds on the size of admissible variations can be given. The practical usefulness of the theorems for estimating the robustness of the q-expectation value with respect to small variations is discussed. 
0808.04159	A model for the waveform behavior of accreting millisecond pulsars: Nearly aligned magnetic fields and moving emission regions	Astrophysics (astro-ph)	Authors:Frederick K. Lamb, Stratos Boutloukos, Sandor Van Wassenhove, Robert T. Chamberlain, Ka Ho Lo, Alexander Clare, Wenfei Yu, M. Coleman Miller	Abstract:  We investigate further a model of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars we proposed earlier. In this model, the X-ray-emitting regions of these pulsars are near their spin axes but move. This is to be expected if the magnetic poles of these stars are close to their spin axes, so that accreting gas is channeled there. As the accretion rate and the structure of the inner disk vary, gas is channeled along different field lines to different locations on the stellar surface, causing the X-ray-emitting areas to move. We show that this "nearly aligned moving spot model" can explain many properties of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars, including their generally low oscillation amplitudes and nearly sinusoidal waveforms; the variability of their pulse amplitudes, shapes, and phases; the correlations in this variability; and the similarity of the accretion- and nuclear-powered pulse shapes and phases in some. It may also explain why accretion-powered millisecond pulsars are difficult to detect, why some are intermittent, and why all detected so far are transients. This model can be tested by comparing with observations the waveform changes it predicts, including the changes with accretion rate. 
0808.04160	Using Relative Entropy to Find Optimal Approximations: an Application to Simple Fluids	Statistical Mechanics (cond-mat.stat-mech)	Authors:Chih-Yuan Tseng, Ariel Caticha	Abstract:  We develop a maximum relative entropy formalism to generate optimal approximations to probability distributions. The central results consist in (a) justifying the use of relative entropy as the uniquely natural criterion to select a preferred approximation from within a family of trial parameterized distributions, and (b) to obtain the optimal approximation by marginalizing over parameters using the method of maximum entropy and information geometry. As an illustration we apply our method to simple fluids. The "exact" canonical distribution is approximated by that of a fluid of hard spheres. The proposed method first determines the preferred value of the hard-sphere diameter, and then obtains an optimal hard-sphere approximation by a suitably weighed average over different hard-sphere diameters. This leads to a considerable improvement in accounting for the soft-core nature of the interatomic potential. As a numerical demonstration, the radial distribution function and the equation of state for a Lennard-Jones fluid (argon) are compared with results from molecular dynamics simulations.
